At the end I decided to get off the road because I didn't want to ride it anymore so I threw ourselves at the grass and we fell then. SIr's parents and family were there and according to them I had riding very well, then QJo told me that CKe told him that he wanted to see a movie with me.\"],[\"I dreamed about the full moon\"],[\"I got up in fear. I dreamed that I was in Corozal with my sister Ed and that a storm came and in the storm there was thunder that fell almost in front of us while we were at the ranch. We tried to go home but the rain and thunder did not let us, until we could and I wanted to take my little things and my brother Chi rushed us while he was on the other side.\"],[\"We were like in  University, and it had the style of the San Martin school, and I was late, I thought we were starting classes but apparently not. AKe and I were in the same U but his schedule was from 7. I met INat. I found my teacher and went to class and put a project about renewable energy, and I and two other people who apparently had a daughter went to do the project, apparently they hated renewable energy, suddenly everything began to fall apart with renewable energies and when they tried to make gasoline disappear, like there was a reactor, every time they showed up with a tank of gasoline, people would catch fire like that. For trying to disappear it as quickly as possible. And ROm appeared at the end.\"],[\"Second Dream: I was in the room and VLa invited me to go for a walk with her boyfriend, then someone else came and made me the same invitation, but when we went to the walk it turns out that the two of them left with their boyfriends and left me there abandoned, and it was like a bike competition, they loaned me a bike and I ran into Ake. We were reaching the end, which was on the stairs of a building, and someone wanted to shoot me and then someone wanted to shoot AKe and it turns out that she was the witch from the previous dream.\"],[\"I dreamed that we were in a weird class that was going to start and there was BAn (Harry Potter). AKe had no beard, and we sat in the same row as this next to the window. It seemed a mix between the capital UTP with the San Martin de Porres school because of the altitude of the ceiling. Apparently it was post-quarantine and when Ake and I saw each other, I asked him for a hug and he agreed, then a deluge began to fall. And he told me something like: \\\"You are combed (something like it is raining and you are all combed)\\\" and then apparently it was a camp and we had to sleep there and I asked him to give me lodging.\"],[\"I dreamed that I was at a party at the electrical congress and my mother went, and we were at the same table or at the one after RFa's and my mother would not have alcohol, so my mother and RFa began to discuss various issues and talked of many things out of place, by the way the food looked very good. So I went out and we were like in the Secondary school but from La Pe\\u00f1a, and I met the sisters PFu and PMe dressed as with the Secondary school uniform. A friend of PFu's boyfriend (in my dream ex boyfriend) went looking for her and she grumbled. In the next dream there was Ake.\"],[\"Today I dreamed that I was on a bus from La Pe\\u00f1a on the Interamericana, trying to see the answers to a midterm exam. I did it first, and then SIr and CAb would. The two of them and the whole family of SIr were on the bus, and there I lent the booklet to one of the two and told them to review the final examples. We arrived at the Agust\\u00edn P\\u00e9rez Colmenares school and there I met ChVi, I wanted to go by bus to my house and ChVi told me to wait for the red bus that was coming soon. The people were all dressed in red sweaters as there was apparently a parade.\"],[\"In the morning I dreamed that I was going like in a bus or minibus to a school and the protagonists of the movie \\u201cSixteen Candles\\u201d were there and we were like in London or Italy (because of the type of building around).\"],[\"I dreamed of a very cool university and that I had an electric car from BYD del Dragon, the university was located where the UTP of Panama is but it was super different because it had elevators and other things, and there was the computer science faculty and there were the cousins Yi and TMi and in that college the girls were super creative and they were like the \\\"girls with bookmarks\\\", so they had suggested being in charge of a magazine and there was AKe, we were talking and he was ordering lunch and they were like between 3-4 pm and supposedly I was going to take him in my car. Also in that dream there were some guys who robbed and a very strange chase began.\"],[\"Second Dream: (I only remember the end) I dreamed that I was wearing a high school uniform, I was going to ride a bus and in the elevator to the bus we were AKe, OAn, BGr, and I don't know why but AKe could do the Split but he could not play charades, and in the end he lost two bags that were actually additional, because they were not from any of us students.\"],[\"I dreamed that I was going to classes with RCa, FMa, QJo and other people. We were at the UTP of Panama at the FIE, the classes were like in the study hall. Then I realized that I had a subject related to logarithms and chemistry with the theory teacher with the last name C\\u00e1ceres and that I was not going to graduate because the laboratory teacher did not tell me that she would no longer let me enter classes. I realized that at home, in my room, because I was supposed to have that class that day but one of my classmates told me not to go because the teacher had taken me out of class. So I decided to go talk to the theory teacher why if I didn't pass the course, I couldn't graduate, and they told me that he was a bad teacher and that the lab teacher kicked me out because I was three times late. In my brain I thought that I had to graduate and that I had to get the theory teacher to accept another job instead of the lab grade. So I went to talk to the theory teacher and I think that now I would have to qualify many things, but he accepted me to continue giving the subject and not to put F.\"],[\"In another dream, I dreamed that I was in a drawing competition, people danced with a background theme related to music and I had to make a drawing that would express it. There were three drawings and the last one looked like an image from Machika's video Anyway there it was.\"],[\"Last night I dreamed of Hashiko, I dreamed that there were two of them, and that we were

effect\\u2026.So I give up, he is in charge\\u2026.Everyone is naked?....We are in a bathroom?....Later, as I go to close the front door here at the ranch, a group of four swallow birds quickly dart by me and fly inside\\u2026.oh oh, I worry and wonder if that is a problem\\u2026.They must have figured out that the arena is gone, and they are looking for new places to make their nests\\u2026.But

our house, to make sure the door and windows are closed\\u2026.The water is likely to come way up the beach\\u2026.I see it come, and the water does go unusually high on the beach, but it does not

off, and now we get a turn\\u2026.I take the lead, as we swoop back and forth\\u2026.But it is difficult because the woman just keeps standing there in the middle of the room, so I have to make sure I avoid hitting her as we swoop around the room\\u2026.I experiment with speed and angle, and find that I can arc upwards so high I can touch the ceiling, on both sides\\u2026.it is lots of fun\\u2026.At another point, I have been in a sexual situation with a woman, and I have a slight erection\\u2026.Then I meet Jones, he is very happy and we give each other a big hug\\u2026.but I can tell he is aware of my erection, and he tries to prolong the hug\\u2026.I turn and twist away in his arms and try to lead us into the other room, it is very awkward and uncomfortable as he keeps hold of me and presses his hips into me\\u2026.Later, a brief image: I am with an unattractive older woman, she is in a nightgown\\u2026.I happen to see her from the side, and a perfect profile of her

bird cheeping, and I look down and see a small bird curled up on the dark red and blue rug, it is hurt\\u2026.I scoop it up and fling it outside into the backyard\\u2026.I wonder, will the bird be ok?....I figure it will certainly be better than if it had stayed in here\\u2026.Then I am outside of a house or apartment complex, looking across a small valley to the hill on the other side\\u2026.There is a modern house built into the hill, with dirt above it, then a tall dark brown apartment building on top of the hill, maybe ten stories tall\\u2026.As I look, dirt starts crumbling down into the modern house\\u2026.at first, I am unsure if this is normal, or the start of something bad\\u2026.But more dirt starts falling, and I realize the guy inside that house is dying\\u2026.As the apartment building starts to sway, I turn in fear and push Ronald forward, and to the right around a corridor, saying run, run, run!....I look back as we go, and see the building falling towards us\\u2026.It looks like we are just beyond where the top of the building will hit, but there will still be a massive blast impact\\u2026.I lead Ronald to a place behind a sturdy

merit\\u2026.Later, I see some dark coats, jackets, and other clothing out, laying across chairs, not hung up properly\\u2026.I think of how I should do that, to help the nice clothes not get wrinkled

I frequently have dreams where I am someone else. This was kind of on the border of that.\"],[\"I had three dreams, the first one had something to do with records and putting them away on a shelf somewhere. I can\\u2019t really remember the second one anymore but the third one was detailed. My older sister was working somewhere new and I went to go visit her. It was really loud and there were a lot of rules - in real life she works as a lawyer but in this it was like a hip young fashion office. She took me to the break room but it was like a big party and there was lots of loud music playing but it didn\\u2019t bother me this time. Then all the sudden it got late and quiet and we were standing in twos of people with wooden pews behind us. This guy named Bass who had been flirtatious all of a sudden got serious and announced that his wife was dying. People shared stories about grief and I stood up and said, \\u201cI know you don\\u2019t know me but you can call me anytime even at three in the morning and I will listen. I will let you talk about them and I can just be there.\\u201d I gave him a big hug and he cried. He looked like somebody I went to high school with who was in my older sister\\u2019s class and died in a motorcycle accident, but it wasn\\u2019t quite him. I don\\u2019t remember his real name but it wasn\\u2019t Bass.\"],[\"I had a dream where the man from the first dream crept into the second dream. My recent ex was in the dream and we were skiing but I didn\\u2019t have the right gear (a helmet or a coat). I felt inadequate and frightened and he laughed at me. He kept wanting me to go break into a house \\u201cfor fun\\u201d which I thought was awful. I went to go find him and the house had little kids in it who were scared. I tried to comfort and distract them. The house was very modern and futuristic and I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to work the doors to get them safely out so I hid with them. The man from the first dream was gone by the end of this (he never went to the house with me).\"],[\"I woke up only remembering the last little bit of the dream. I was waiting for the elevator at an apartment building and holding my dog, Pinto. I wasn\\u2019t feeling well and started to faint (related to my chronic illness in real life) and there were two nurses at the elevator waiting. I asked them for help and they just kept talking. Then Mary, a nurse, I actually have worked with came to help. She carried me and my dog to my apartment and I remembered feeling embarrassed that she saw me like this. In real life this is not someone who has been kind to me at work, and I work extra hard to keep my heart open to her. In any case, then I woke up!\"],[\"I was in an underground hotel lobby with all the lights on. It had wood floors, wood ceiling wood-paneled walls. I\\u2019d been there before in another dream but not in real life. I was waiting for a massage at the spa. A bartender took my order and left, tipping his hat. I saw people but did not talk to anyone. I went swimming in the underground pool. The pool reminded me of a bath at a temple stay in Japan. Then I went into a dark stadium alone. Then I woke up.\"],[\"The dreams I remember mostly centered around my ex boyfriend and being unfaithful during our relationship and finding out later. In my dream I was confused and hurt. In real life I don\\u2019t think this happened but would not have been surprised, either. This is a theme though that comes up in my dreams about him often over the almost five years we were together. Wonder what else that may symbolize?\"],[\"Last night I dreamt that my late husband Caleb met me for a weekend away. He was young and I was older. We had a great time at a bed and breakfast, walking around and seeing my older sister Liz. We went driving back home but when I got off the exit it was all grassy and completely vertical. He agreed to take the car up the \\u201chill\\u201d so we got into two cars and I was following him but then I lost him. Then I woke up.\"],[\"This was interesting and maybe a first - I don\\u2019t remember my dream but woke up with a song playing in my head that was part of the dream. It\\u2019s called \\u201cAll Ways Love\\u201d by Tubby Love. It felt soothing and hopeful to wake up - love that song!\"],[\"I was with my same two friends, Emily and Tyler, and we were now in a village set in a different time period. Maybe it was the early 1900s. We split up to go find our way back home and each had different adventures. I can\\u2019t remember what they were but it was dark/night out. I felt safe but didn\\u2019t feel Tyler was safe because he is gay and it wasn\\u2019t accepted where we were.\"],[\"I was in a part of dream 2, but an old neighbor was there renovating a house. One of my ex\\u2019s dogs (that I consider like one of mine) was there walking through a building with me. He was going ahead to check for safety as it was under construction. It was dark and had a lot of steps both up and down. There was an older man working on the kitchen of a unit and he was an old neighbor of mine. He was showing me a decorative white porcelain fixture for the kitchen or bathroom with an early 1900s style delicate painting of a woman.\"],[\"I was with my late husband\\u2019s best friend's wife, Candace. She invited her younger teenage sister over who was wearing a yellow bikini top and tiny black shorts with a robe. There were older guys at the house leering at her and I felt like this could be very inappropriate. In real life I\\u2019ve never met her sister but doubt this would happen. I told her to maybe throw some clothes on and they called me a prude and insecure. I was angry about it when I woke up.\"],[\"I was living in a community again that was familiar from my dreams but I don\\u2019t recognize it from waking life. It was a housing development all alone in the high plains. It had snowed recently. I walked past a house that had been for rent but there were big burned wooden beams inside - someone told me it had burned down. I went to my house but the dogs were not there so I went to pick them up from my ex\\u2019s house. He was not there but there was a guy who called on the phone saying he was looking for him. Then he called me and asked me to get him to work on getting the Christmas tree put away. Then some workers came and tried to move it and it broke. He yelled and it made one of the workers cry so I hugged him.\"],[\"I had a dream I went to yoga class (I have not been able to go because of my health right now). Interestingly, it wasn\\u2019t day or night but underground again. I saw random acquaintances I knew in real life including a teacher who I used to run into randomly everywhere (Whole Foods, Trader Joe\\u2019s, gas stations) so much so that he used to joke that he wasn\\u2019t stalking me. I had recently messaged them to congratulate them on something they did and they had written me back to say they were wondering if I had moved because I wasn\\u2019t around and if I wanted to get a free pass to their class. I haven\\u2019t written back because I didn\\u2019t want to say anything about my health. I\\u2019ve recently had some news and am not sharing publicly yet, and I just don\\u2019t know what to say other than thanks I hope to be there soon. Back to the dream. Then I was able to practice in class and it was lovely!\"],[\"I was a man (not me) and part of a gang/bad group of men who were smuggling something. I was driving a car underground - deep deep underground - and every time I would come to a fork in the road I would stop to ask the leader which way to go. We stopped at an underground diner and had sweet potatoes and blueberry pie, it was run by a large African American woman and she was hiding her kids from us and she was obviously scared and wanted us to leave. The lighting was all underground with candles and low lights on the walls.\"],[\"I was a young girl (not me) at some kind of college I\\u2019ve never been to. It looked like Chicago but I\\u2019ve never been there. It was dark/night and we were going out dancing. I was with a friend but also on a date with a guy. It was like an 80s movie. We went to a bar and by the end we had sung karaoke and ripped up our dresses - suddenly I was wearing a long wedding dress and it was ripped to my knees and glitter/color all over it like a Cyndi Lauper video or something. It was free and happy and lighthearted but there was an element of danger lurking.\"],[\"Dreamt that my younger sister was in the hospital and had similar rare chronic disease I have (or they think I have).\"],[\"A scene at my grandparents\\u2019 lake cottage of taking care of my sister when she was a kid. She was being bratty and wanted to tear apart the room to play something called \\u201ckinex.\\u201d\"],[\"I was driving to a concert at night with ex boyfriend Rory and when we arrived it was my late husband Caleb singing. I think it was the afterlife. There was a woman singing and she was really into it. She said \\u201cI think I remember you from last time\\u201d and I introduced myself as Caleb\\u2019s wife and her face fell. Her name was Dawn Jo. It was dark. She looked concerned but I wasn\\u2019t at all.\"],[\"Had a dream my brother in law (who is an Army Ranger) broke into my apartment looking for info to use against my sister for their divorce.\"],[\"Had a dream I was driving with ex boyfriend Rory in a new city - he had just moved and we were going to check it out. It was dark outside and bright inside like a mall. We left and went to a party in New York and my late husband\\u2019s friends were there including Noah and a bunch of guys who represented his best friends. I left to go get ready and then woke up.\"],[\"I had a dream I was hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know and someone gave me a necklace that said \\u201cbeware\\u201d or something similar and mentioned my health. Then I went to meet roommates for a new apartment in the town in this dream. We decided to make tacos. When we went to the store we came across a drunk woman and she attached herself to us so we tried to take care of her, but when she became sober she wouldn\\u2019t leave. My older sister showed up to visit at some point and then I woke up. The dream was disorienting and confusing, I was annoyed by all of the people in it during my dream.\"],[\"I had a dream I was renting a room in a house or maybe like an RV from a guy. There was at least one other roommate. We were told to be careful plugging in our devices as they drained the system. When I went to bed I looked outside the window and saw trash and book bags on the ground, then saw older dogs sleeping outside. I didn\\u2019t know how I could sleep while these dogs were outside. I made eye contact with one who just looked so so sad. Then I woke up. The whole dream was set at night.\"],[\"I was wearing a fancy red dress and working some high level job as a politician. Some type of emergency (maybe a government attack) happened when I went to the bathroom. Some man I worked with in dream but not in real life followed me to the bathroom. I changed and then I woke up.\"],[\"This dream was surreal. I dreamt that I was with my high school friends at a basketball tournament but got stuck/lost somewhere. A young Ram Dass came to be with me while I was stuck in some kind of trap. It was intimate physically but not sexual. In some way he represented all teachers, all people. He was just loving me, literally it felt like I was being filled with love. I felt warm and peaceful, content. I have never dreamt of him or any other of my teachers before. I woke up immediately feeling warm and loved.\"],[\"I was driving down this road going over the speed limit. The sign said 50, although it was in a neighborhood so I knew it was over, and I missed a stop sign. It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow\\u2019s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I\\u2019ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids. Then I went to drive around looking for a gift of plates but all of the stores were closed. I remember bashing Trump in a few conversations.\"],[\"I was me but also wasn\\u2019t me - like me but not me now? I was skating around and around and around an indoor skating rink. There was a company offsite and I kept seeing people that I knew but I don\\u2019t know in real life but had met before in dreams. We were all going around and around. They were all faces of people I knew from some job but I never knew these people in my life now. It was all wooden and lit with artificial lighting and there was music playing and it felt like it was supposed to be safe but was not really. I didn\\u2019t want to stay but I couldn\\u2019t leave.\"],[\"In this dream it was deep deep sleep and it was dark out. I dreamt I was supposed to dance in a performance with my OT colleague Susan and my friend Kate who also works as an OT . We met and danced wearing clear gloves holding hands for rehearsal. Then we were supposed to meet for the final performance and I couldn\\u2019t get there on time. I was late and annoyed. I tried to get ready but had GI distress and then tried to do makeup but my eyebrows were gone. Then these men were coming down the road and I could see them kicking up dust. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a group of people and someone who looked like my older sister and we were walking in a place that looked like NYC, it was dusk, turning dark quickly. We saw an overweight man in a wheelchair at the top of the stairs and he asked us to push him down, we said no and he said it would help him get down the ramp. We started to walk away and he started to slide away and my sister caught the wheelchair. Then I think he had a dog with him. We all went to a dark place like a bar and these blonde women at the front were jeering at us and I lifted both hands and flipped them off (not something I would do in real life). It was forceful but dark and I don't know if they could see me. Another dream was I was in a large grocery store and people were eyes down scurrying around. Last dream I was watching a video of myself as a kid. I was injured and in some kind of sled on the grass but it was daylight.\"],[\"I had a dream I showed up in this house in the dark with the lights on. It was a cottage. There was a group of people already there. I knew I had been there in dreams but not in real life. It was attached to another house behind the driveway. The house had brown shingles with white icicle lights on it. I think it was winter. I was looking inside a window. There were people and they all knew each other but I didn\\u2019t know them. I think it wasn\\u2019t their house either- they were sheltering there where they were able to survive. There was an old dog bed that did not match the dog in the picture on the counter. I felt sad. There was a peanut butter jar, and I had a taste and threw away the knife and this made the group tell me (they spoke to me as one, not as individuals): \\u201cthat was a rookie mistake!\\u201d But it was not friendly. It was immediately safe but also dangerous, and I could not stay. I did not fit with them. I went to the back of the house and down to a small restaurant. There was a Jacuzzi with a lock on it. I think the dream before that I was walking the streets and there were police out everywhere. In another part before that I was driving around and I should not have been driving around, it was dark.\"],[\"It was dark and I was at the store trying to buy eggs. I bought two hard boiled and two loose unboiled eggs but I dropped them when I went to the counter. I apologized to the clerk but they wouldn\\u2019t look at me. I was returning to a house I was remodeling, all made of wood. It was still dark but there were lanterns. I felt lacking, apologetic, not enough.\"],[\"I don\\u2019t think I was me. I was a woman and I was being shown half of a house, a duplex. It wasn\\u2019t nighttime yet but not daytime - dusk and gray. It was a craftsman type house with a lot of wood details, and someone was showing me room to room to room. I was part of a couple but the man was never home. Another couple moved in and I thought they were moving into the adjacent duplex side of the house but they insisted on living on my side. Then the dream turned into a nightmare, we were cooking and chopping dinner and the woman started threatening me with the big shiny knife. I woke up and my heart was racing. I even thought I heard something in the other room but there was no other sound when I listened. Went back to sleep.\"],[\"It was dark, I was not me, I was an African-American woman and her daughter. I was both of them. The story played twice. I was one of them each time. There is a house we went to for safety and I think it was supposed to be a grandmothers\\u2019 house. There were old school hair mirrors on the vanity table. One night we left and it seemed like it was part of a wild game preserve or Safari or something - I don\\u2019t have a reference point for. They were giving tours at night to school children, I think. We weren\\u2019t supposed to be there so we stayed alongside the underpart where they couldn\\u2019t see us in the shadows. I remember holding onto the crumbling side of dirt and rocks and looking up. You could see the stars and you could see the man, hoping he could not see you. If you got out far enough you were free but it was dangerous like a desert. It was daytime in the desert and you could see it. The first time we went, I was the mom. I tried to hide behind a tree but he saw her and we had to get on our knees. Somehow we got away. The second time we did the same story and I was the daughter and we were much more clever. I woke up with my heart pounding.\"],[\"I was helping a slightly older couple sort through and donate clothing - I think it belonged to someone the man knew. I held up sweaters that did not fit him or were very feminine. There was a whole truck of them, some of the sweaters were not tightly woven or too small. I called my sister Sarah. In the dream she was my sister but we were the same age I think (in real life she was born on my 9th birthday).\"],[\"I was at a small bar concert or something and the woman who cuts my hair was a proxy for me to buy cowboy boots and jeans. It was night.\"],[\"I was in Asia and in a crowded bustling city at night. I was with two companions but they didn\\u2019t talk to me. I had several iPhones. We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I\\u2019m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn\\u2019t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn\\u2019t have it. I was staying alone in a hotel room that was like a train compartment and then it was dark and raining. I woke up sweating.\"],[\"I was in a dimly lit yoga class in what looked like a barn or wooden room and there was a front section for people who could practice on a mat and I was in the back on a seated section where it was darker. There were people with me but it was hard to see them. It was a teacher I used to see a lot on Sundays, and it was a class I used to go to every week before I got POTs.\"],[\"I was working in a house for someone. It wasn\\u2019t dark outside but it wasn\\u2019t light either- a place I\\u2019ve never been in real life but in my dream I\\u2019ve been there before. It was old fashioned; it looked Victorian style - lots of lace and a huge heavy dining room table with claw feet. I was hurrying to clean up before the owners came home. There were at least two dogs with me, one small/medium sized and golden brownish and one larger and brown. I think they belonged to the owners of the house but I took care of them. I think a big wave came at the end of the dream with water rushing everywhere and then I woke up (or thought I did) and I thought my Apple Watch was calling someone but when I checked later it wasn\\u2019t. It seemed like it really happened. I thought I heard, \\u201chello, hello\\u201d in a deep female or lighter male voice. I double checked my iPhone and my Apple Watch which I was wearing to monitor my heart rate. I wasn\\u2019t scared but confused.\"],[\"It was dark. I don\\u2019t think I was me. I think I was a brunette and was some kind of spy or something. I was meeting up with some man at a restaurant for an exchange, but I saw him sitting with a woman and was surprised. I felt jealous and betrayed. I walked up to this man. I think I said something clever and mean, and I left something on the table. Later, I had to go back and retrieve something from a dark brick one-story building, I wasn\\u2019t supposed to be there. Somehow I got caught and the package opened and then all these people came out of the ground but they were duplicates of the same set of people, replicating over and over and over again, and then more started walking out of a school bus. I don\\u2019t think I knew the faces but they were familiar in the dream. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my ex and we were going to a festival or something and we had to pick out a tent and we were looking at all the different fabric types and debating which one to get. I was advocating for waterproof. We were joking about one that was an American flag.\"],[\"This one was more emotional. I woke up with mixed emotions. In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn\\u2019t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that\\u2019s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows\"],[\"I was in the woods in a house and getting a FedEx delivery sent to my sister Susan\\u2019s cottage. In my dream we all lived near each other in the woods.\"],[\"My apartment building at night was outside. Instead of how it actually is, there were floor to ceiling windows and someone was showing me the closets and how they were different and somehow this explained why I was sick. Then this man invited me into his room in the unit and he looked like my ex\\u2019s friend Franco but was not him. He was sitting on the bed with prayer flags behind him and he was trying to explain something to me but I did not want to listen. In real life I have an aversion to him, his energy always feels like coyote trickster or something to me - like always up to something, so it was weird to come up in my dream.\"],[\"I was making jewelry out of a flimsy kit. I left the kit on the side of the road and these boys about age 11-12 found it. They were beating up their friend and I tried to stop them. They didn\\u2019t want to make jewelry at first but then they tried it and liked it. I left but had to go back because I left purple earrings for my little sister, Sarah.\"],[\"It was dark but like old western themed muted gray outside too. Women wearing long skirts lining up to practice shooting guns. Metal sounds clinking everywhere. Buckets of shells. Dirt on the ground. Dusty targets that were also like big bowls. Big wooden containers of supplies. Waiting in line for big guns. I could feel the vibration of the kickbacks from the shots. Big guns like shotguns, little guns and the targets. The big guns had bullets that came out with rubber tips that looked really phallic. I don\\u2019t remember much else other than it felt very purposeful and we weren\\u2019t talking or joking, we were training.\"],[\"Baby on my hip, not sure if it was supposed to be mine, but felt like I was babysitting. Following someone downstairs to an underground bar. There were only women. All happy and clustered and drunk, laughing. I was following someone to a Fingernail bar. Woman in a gold sequin dress talking to other women squeezing by her. Going to get plain nails and dip them in the cup with gold glitter.\"],[\"I was in a room in a house and there was a workout video playing of doing floor abs and it was like 80s leotard old school. Something I haven't seen or thought about in years. It almost looked like a contemporary art experience. Then three loud noises \\u201cboom boom boom\\u201d and I woke up. My head on fire.\"],[\"I had a dream that my little sister Susan was having an affair on her husband with someone who reminded me of my ex. I was watching it like a movie and there were red long rugs rolled up in a big ballroom and they were running away. The sky and everything was navy blue like the ocean. I had no emotion - normally things like this even when I know I\\u2019m dreaming or wake up from the dream get me riled up for a minute but I felt nothing.\"],[\"There were two parts to the dream - the first part I was with somebody but I don\\u2019t remember who, and it was dark and we were basically squatting at some building and we knew we weren\\u2019t supposed to be there (but we stayed there anyways) and there was some kind of election. We knew we had to leave because there was a new owner that came and we couldn\\u2019t stay. So we left and we went running through the woods and I lost the other person. I had to jump all these fences like one after another after another but they were set up really close to one another, so I would jump one and literally the next fence would be one foot after it. Then there are these artificial lights and I came across the stadium and the security guards were outside and I started jogging like it was my plan to jog there the whole time and look for this high school. I went inside and met this class that was gathered inside talking about their plans for graduation. Somebody said that they were accepted to medical school, somebody else was talking about something that they learned about themselves...like an introduction and it was artificial lighting like in the science lab and for some reason it was a high school. I told everybody, \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you at the University of Connecticut,\\u201d and I was telling them that I went there for high school. We played against them and always lost and I was coming there to find a job. I don\\u2019t think I was me in this dream.\"],[\"Fragmented dream. I was at work in our primary group room at the hospital with a few of my coworkers and my manager walked in for a huddle. We pointed up to the ceiling and showed her how it was buckling - it\\u2019s the kind of drop ceiling that looks white with a grid pattern- it was bulging with something that looked like pillow stuffing. We all went to get a closer look and see if we could fix it. There was also a magical component to the dream. I wish I could remember more but it was something like after this happened someone painted me with a wand and I had the pastel colors again and went for a walk by myself. It was so ordinary but it was otherworldly.\"],[\"I was at a house in the kitchen and I\\u2019ve never been there before. It was older and everything was worn down and white but cared for- my ex was there and he was angry. I don\\u2019t know why. I was cleaning up a broken garbage bag on the floor and trying to put everything inside of the next one and it kept poking through and I realized they were brooms and brushes and of course they would poke through. Someone came to the door and it was a whole group of people who were actually banging on the door. There was a redhead woman wearing a pink dress and I think she was a trans woman and she said she needed to marry her wife and now she couldn\\u2019t. The men behind her looked threatening and we let her inside.\"],[\"The last dream I saw my old friend Luke in the parking lot and he asked where I\\u2019ve been and invited me to a party on a train. I got to the party and it was like boxcar apartments on the train and everyone was playing guitar. There was some kind of game or guitar competition, but it was really crowded and while it looked fun, I just wanted to get off the moving train and away from all of these people, mostly men. Something about it didn\\u2019t feel safe.\"],[\"I was driving over the bridge - I\\u2019m pretty sure it was San Mateo bridge - and I drove over it more than once but I don\\u2019t remember why. The road was really bumpy and I think I was by myself in the car the first time, and the second time I was with somebody else. I was in a big hurry and there were a lot of people driving over the bridge. In real life I never drive over the bridge\"],[\"I was in a neighborhood of people I don\\u2019t know and they invited me to come for a dinner in a garage. There were poster signs everywhere and there was a large blonde woman and some younger blonde children. She was celebrating something and making everyone food. When I came by I introduced myself and sat down and put on a face mask. She got angry with me and said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need that here! This has ruined the summer for my granddaughters!\\u201d pointing to them. I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really ruined the lives of people who died, and she said, \\u201cName them, name your patients!\\u201d I tried to explain that I couldn\\u2019t for HIPAA and that I worked in mental health and that many people are impacted right now in many ways, but she was so angry, foaming at the mouth and said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to have a plate anymore you can leave!\\u201d\"],[\"Another dream. I was with a younger black man and woman, they were wearing protective gear but I don\\u2019t think I was really a character/actor just a witness in the dream. They were in combat. They locked the door with the kind of lock that is a circular handle that closes safes. They were exchanging fire with people across the street. It was all under control. It was measured and it felt like the future.\"],[\"I was inside of some building and was given a code to get snacks. The machine was so hard to figure out and I finally got some snacks but it was all chocolate kisses. I saw someone else with popcorn, so I went to try to get that and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with someone else and maybe a small group of people and we were trying to get furniture for an apartment for someone we know. I had to watch scenes in my mind of people negotiating with the landlord about the different animals they could have. They had two small white dogs and a very small pet pig or something and there was another really small alligator or some reptile that could only stay in the kitchen and pace north to south on the kitchen floor, and there was like some type of instrument that would let us know that it was only going north to south, and it had covers over its feet. The two dogs were small white and matching and they could go anywhere in the apartment. I think the apartment was somewhere in New York City. It reminded me of New York somehow - it was for a couple but I don\\u2019t think it was for me. I was watching this like a movie. I was back with the group of people then we all went to IKEA to get the furniture and it turned into a mob. We were all walking counterclockwise and shoulder to shoulder and kept going in a circle trying to grab the items that we needed and couldn\\u2019t communicate with the other people we were with about what they were getting and we just kept throwing things into a pile of pillows and rugs. I kept trying to work my way over to people to make sure we were getting the right things but it was impossible to maneuver and there were all these different huge pillows that go on couches oversized on oversized like too big for words and it was really frustrating and I don\\u2019t even think they were for me- they went to the people in this apartment. Then it flashed back to the apartment and the landlord was saying something about how the reptile was doing okay going north to south in the kitchen but that he\\u2019s been hearing the couple argue in the corner of the apartment. The apartment was dark with hardwood floors that were dark wood and white tiles and I\\u2019ve never been there before.\"],[\"I keep dreaming fragments - I\\u2019m drinking water or eating breakfast. Kurt Cobain was in one and we were talking about something. I think I interviewed him about causing a ruckus at city hall once. There was a family breakfast I kept eating and then realizing I was NPO (nothing by mouth) in my dream.\"],[\"I was on several floors of a house with a circular staircase and I\\u2019ve never been there. I think I was me. I was trying to get to the top for privacy and peace just to rest and there was a white soaking bathtub and a white cozy clean looking bed and I wanted to get clean and get in bed and rest but some force or somebody kept calling me back calling me back like gravity pulling me down from this room.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me- I was a woman like me but she was rich and coiffed and she was purchasing a home. It was a preview of the home with everything encased in plastic so it could be wiped down, even the art on the walls. I watched her walk to a white van with a man and then I woke up.\"],[\"Next dream, same universe as the beaches. I was driving a red convertible to the ocean again, I was with my ex Rory and his friends. We found a place to sit down on a patch of rocks on the water\\u2019s edge and there was a young black man right next to us and I couldn\\u2019t take my eyes off him, I knew him, the one from my other dreams. He caught me staring at him and I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, you remind me of my friend\\u2019s husband (I named him) but I know you\\u2019re not him. I feel like I know you.\\u201d He introduced himself quietly and smiled so I saw all his teeth but I don\\u2019t remember his name. His voice was so kind. He took off his baseball cap and put it on my head over my straw hat, and nestled it in to make sure it was on there. He said something about there\\u2019s only eight groups of us at this beach. Then he got in the water. Then Rory and I decided we were hungry, debating between tacos and lobster rolls so we started walking on this decrepit but very crowded boardwalk. We saw lots of artists, lots of homeless people. One woman was sitting in a wheelchair; her face was painted grayish white but her lips were moving and I asked if she was okay but she didn\\u2019t answer and everyone kept walking by. She was dying slowly right there invisible but how could you miss her. It was like her body was 95 perfectly entombed. Then the waves started to come at first splashed through the boardwalk and then bigger where we had to hold onto the railings. Then we turned to leave and the waves kept coming and washing out the boardwalk in every direction, the railing was not sturdy; there were areas it was replaced with children safety gates and didn\\u2019t feel sustainable and I held on by the tips of my fingers and felt the water lift the rest of my body up and thought I couldn\\u2019t hold on any longer. People were just holding on wave after wave and we were losing each other but I wasn\\u2019t panicked because I let my body just float when it needed to float and move when it could. The people with their feet on the ground kept getting knocked over. I shouted to let go, let go and hold on hands only but they didn\\u2019t listen. After what felt like forever, it stopped. I walked along the inside of the artist areas and people were in there with water on the floor but otherwise unaffected. A group of white young women wearing all white shirts and green shorts came in perfectly dry and complaining loudly that they weren\\u2019t letting people in because of the waves and I really gave it to them. I let them know about the severity of the ordeal and they needed to be careful too if they were going down there. They didn\\u2019t seem to care that people just died. They just shrugged their shoulders. Then my father in law was at the boardwalk and we were checking out all of the art and he turned to me and said \\u201clet\\u2019s get a tattoo!\\u201d In real life this is something he has been telling me about as a memory of his son, my late husband.\"],[\"I was in my ex Rory\\u2019s Jeep with the dogs and we were going somewhere too fast and I told him so and he said, \\u201cno we are fine.\\u201d But then all a sudden he realized it and we were skidding over mud and he had to slow down and we started spinning and I grabbed onto my dog and then we saw these large animals like dinosaurs with big bumpy patches all over them. Later we were on a sidewalk in lawn chairs that moved. We just sat down and he showed me that the road would move underneath the chairs, but the chairs would not move.\"],[\"Whew! Woke up and felt winded like I just was running. My dreams were dark but not scary with lots of grey and some beige and yellow. The last dream was vivid. I was working on my unit but it was the future, I knew because the young social worker had a mustache and it was turning gray. He poked his head around the door and said, \\u201cwe have more coming; we have to make room.\\u201d All of us, even the patients that could, made room for more beds. We lined the beds up so close to each other with no dividers and no rooms anymore, just beds next to each other and we turned the hallway into a unit. It was still the psych unit though. Some of my long stay patients were still there and one of them from a previous dream was in a wheelchair and these doctors came to see him but they hadn\\u2019t aged. They were like, \\u201cget up and walk,\\u201d and he did, but he was so tiny, like a little old man boy. He had stopped talking. There were mostly men on the unit, only a few women. One of the women was maybe a social worker from a place I used to work but she was getting admitted to our unit (not happening in real life) and she was angry, she was like, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna have to make me walk through that door!\\u201d The security guard Arshis kept asking me if I was okay, something he\\u2019s been doing in real life lately because there has been a real threat to me on the unit. There was something unsafe outside like a war zone or something and we were living and working there. We were staying there forever and it was gray out of the widows, there was no sun, no day, no night. I wasn\\u2019t sad, I was working and working the milieu of patients like I always do and I belonged. I couldn\\u2019t leave them.\"],[\"I was frantically trying to put items away on a shelf but nothing fit and I kept dropping everything. It was odd. It ends with a lot of jewelry.\"],[\"I\\u2019m struggling to recall everything but I have these intense memories of being with a group of people and bonding intensely because we had to and meeting in an apartment in a dark apartment somewhere. I don\\u2019t know if I was me but then we all got into this train together and someone else had to drive it. This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like \\u201coh shit\\u201d and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.\"],[\"I was doing something with my sister Liz who is older and we were having an outdoor party and there were configurations of people and we needed to figure out where they were going to be under the tent. She changed it and told everybody about it and took credit for changing it. For some reason this annoyed me and in real life this is something she would do and I would let it go because I don\\u2019t care. We were serving American food and Indian food and I don\\u2019t know why it was a big deal or a faux pas but it was definitely a problem to combine the two. I think there were fireworks too and the whole dream was at night.\"],[\"I was underground somewhere with my family and we were looking at the history of the fault lines and earthquakes. We discovered an inaccuracy! It was a big deal- for some reason we were in a ship and there was a lock (waterway) system and somehow this was related to the 1800s. We saw that after the earthquake in the 1800s (which in my dream I think I related to as big as the 1906 in San Francisco) they decided not to fix the underground area because it was all working. We followed the cracks on the floor and then realized there were less cracks on the other side of the room, and somehow this was significant. The imagery was of a big steel ship/boat with dark deep blue paint. Also in part of this dream I was having dinner with my dad by the water\\u2019s edge - by this lock system - and I had just finished eating with my sisters when he came late. I left them to eat together. My sister was going to order a snack. I went to go make myself a big parsley fresh veggie drink somewhere by myself in a hotel room. In my dream I remember thinking, this is a LOT of parsley, but this is really refreshing.\"],[\"I was with a group of older ladies on a trip and there was a scene of getting back into the back of a mini van to go home. They had to arrange themselves like squished in the van.\"],[\"I was watching a scene like on tv but able to participate, like wearing goggles. There was a middle aged black man and his maybe 11 year old son. They were talking about moving from California to Detroit area because the dad lost his job. The dad was playing with his son in the front yard somewhere. There was a golden retriever playing with them that I know in real life (my somewhat adopted dog who lives with ex) named Trevor. Trevor recognized me and ran over happily wagging his tail, telling me about his family. They were talking about having all four seasons in Detroit.\"],[\"Dreams ended with the picture of the sunset right before it gets dark on a tree, maybe a poplar with black leaves and what looked like striated pastels in the background. I wish I could paint. It was so beautiful. Peaceful.\"],[\"This was like a movie of myself from months ago -it was back in maybe March when my fever hit and the doctors didn\\u2019t want to do this for some reason but told me if I was serious about finding out what was going on health wise, I would need to shave my head completely: they were so hesitant about it, I didn\\u2019t even resist for a moment and was like \\u201cokay; let\\u2019s do this, When do I need to have it done?\\u201d and they said June and I said \\u201cbut it\\u2019s August\\u201d and then I woke up. There were yellow and red colors all around me. I was at the hospital for some surgery and they put me in a device and on the side it had a bunch of diagnoses to rule out but I couldn\\u2019t read them all.\"],[\"This dream wasn\\u2019t in black-and-white; it was like in dark blue and gray and white colors. It felt like it took place somewhere else entirely- no place I have ever been to in real life. The people I went to see in the dream were familiar to me in the dream but not in real life. I went to see a couple and I think in the dream I had known the male previously but it was years and years since I had seen him. When I got to their house we practiced yoga and I remember doing lots of hip openers and it was like I almost couldn\\u2019t get the deepest stretch because in everything I did, I was so flexible (this has not been the case in real life as I\\u2019ve not been able to practice like I used to). But the release that I felt from forward folds of all types was amazing - it was like I just folded into myself. I think I did a bunch of seated spinal twists, too. These are all things I can do in real life but for some reason in the dream I was like Gumby and I couldn\\u2019t find the tension to release half of the time. Then we all went to bed on the same bed, but it was not sexual. We just fell asleep and when we woke up we had to go somewhere so we scurried around getting ready and we were leaving. I needed to go back and do something like take my medicine or something like that. I messed up the covers and then I woke up.\"],[\"These are fragments: Gems underground. Chris Cuomo was having a party next door and it was just like you would imagine someone on tv is like in real life. I think I had been watching a lot of news or something. He was having a party and wearing a suit, maybe a plaid suit like old school. Young black man showing me where he died twice. Singing Hare Krishna. Woke up with maha mantra on my tongue.\"],[\"I was with a group of people all coupled up. We were younger and we wore plastic bags over our feet to walk downstairs. I don\\u2019t remember much more.\"],[\"I was with ex Rory and he was driving a car and it was familiar in the dream, but not in real life. Some workers outside are wearing masks and some not. We drove by an outdoor jewelry store (all stores have moved outside) and I thought I saw people taking things and commented that if I was security I would have to be careful not to assume everyone was guilty. Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He\\u2019s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said \\u201cI knew you would pull that card!\\u201d And I started to read it but couldn\\u2019t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said \\u201clove.\\u201d He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate. The lights went out and I couldn\\u2019t find any clothes that fit. Then I woke up and my heart was racing.\"],[\"I was driving in the same universe but in a car. I stopped into a small town and it was snowing. There was a movie theater and a menswear shop. I went into the shop and saw a friend of a friend who I knew from working in San Francisco a long time ago. I haven\\u2019t seen or thought of them in years. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I had a dream that I was waking up, which was actually happening. My brain was processing all the images and feelings and emotions and moods and I was categorizing them. It was like I was watching my brain work while I slept but I was still waking up. I can\\u2019t remember content; it was more just the operational bird\\u2019s eye top level view of sorting and organizing.\"],[\"This was so fragmented - I had a dream that I was watching myself on a phone call on a corner having a serious conversation about something and then watching a neighbor come across me who was across the street from me. They had ching length white hair. They seemed pleasant and they had a red hammock that I could use when I came to knock on their door later that was all in the bushes.\"],[\"In my dream I was meeting with a man who was supposed to be a hands on healer but he was also creepy and I was trying to avoid him. He was going around visiting people and I was hiding from him in the bathroom. It was dark. We were near an ocean. Covid was happening or still happening because of masks and I was worried about people being too close.\"],[\"Half or full asleep - not sure - open door, shadows almost like visions of trucks going by, marching. All grey and green.\"],[\"A white room. My ex Rory was outside the door and I was inside. I was creating art or something on the floor. I had pot that was spilling everywhere and red wine, but I didn\\u2019t want him to see it. There was another part to the dream where we were in a house and having sex with each other but by extension with other people in other rooms but it wasn\\u2019t a graphic or sexual even. It was matter of fact. I could be where I was and be experiencing what they were experiencing. I was just experiencing people. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it.\"],[\"I was me I think and I was with a group of other people I\\u2019ve never met. We were at a store of some kind, maybe a children\\u2019s store and people were not wearing masks. Something happened: one of the men was bad and he got injured. He tried to take me and run away but I ran with another woman and I didn\\u2019t quite trust her either. We were suddenly driving at night on the streets where I grew up (kinda) and all the kids were camped out in tents on the football and soccer fields at night and only some of them were wearing masks.\"],[\"I\\u2019m climbing stairs with a colleague and other healthcare workers helping out somewhere. We\\u2019re trying to find space for our belongings and all the spaces were claimed. There were these symbols that looked like circles and guitars but not quite guitars, like Picasso guitars. There was another symbol that looked like a Scorpio sign or something almost like the prince symbol with a spade. We could not find any unclaimed area to even put one water bottle. I was frustrated but we finally found a spot to put our things after what felt like forever so we could get to work.\"],[\"I was with my older sister and she was somehow newly famous. She was going to give a concert or something and we were driving ourselves to each location. When we arrived, people were trying to sign her dress and we needed to go to the bathroom and change into jeans. In the first place, everything went smoothly. The second stop on the tour was someplace in California. We got there and she was changing in the bathroom. She was really short with me and I was basically her assistant. Then we went upstairs. It was like a bed-and-breakfast/ hotel/ concert venue. We looked out the window and we saw all these tiny little people. They looked like tiny little aliens but they were children and we realized it was a sweatshop next door. The children are comforting each other and there is an American flag there. It made me sick to my stomach and I kept wondering how we were going to help them and it was really upsetting. We were trying to figure out if we could call the police or call somebody to come in stay at that room so they could see what we are seeing and help these children because we know if we went to just go rescue them we could make it worse\"],[\"I was with my friend from South Africa and either one of her friends or a guide and we were climbing around these Crystal caves. There was no gravity or sense of space because I was sideways and upside down and at one point I was worried I was going to fall through. They put something underneath me to hold me but there was something really powerful about the crystals I was holding onto. It was also dangerous. They were amethyst maybe.\"],[\"I have no idea where this dream came from but it was attached to the end of the crystal dream where somebody was showing us their teeth and they had inserted Christmas lights and got tube lights to go on their teeth. We were saying that this wouldn\\u2019t stand the test of time but someday they would be sorry that they did this.\"],[\"Two scenes where there was a neighborhood restaurant or group of restaurants and we needed goggles and masks to go in and some cost extra money. There was a seafood place that you could hear and see from there with weird old time music playing and red checkered stuff everywhere. I don\\u2019t know if it was this same dream or not but I was with my ex Rory and other guys showed up as part of our group or nearby. One of them, after much time, angrily came up to Rory and said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t give her any affection, dude what is wrong with you!\\u201d He was vitriolic and I tried to calm him down but he stormed off.\"],[\"I was driving home and there were these huge parking structures and we all had to wait in our cars in order to go down and up these ramps. There were a lot of tiny sports cars and the ramps were designed so you could go fast or slow down the ramps. I went slow down the fast ramp.\"],[\"I was visiting Aidan, my friend from high school, and I think staying there while visiting the jail. She had this huge kitchen with all of these desserts lined up and organized for a party she was having for her kids. I tried to help pass out birdhouses but they were all wrong hanging from broken hooks. My younger sister Sarah was there and I was going to give her a cabbage patch one because she wouldn\\u2019t have had that in her age group growing up younger, but I got chastised for it. Not sure by who. It was dark. So many desserts. I went to get something out of my bag and my cash was soaking wet because something spilled on it and Aidan said I could pay her for my kids and I was like, \\u201cmy kids?\\u201d I guess she had been watching my kids in the dream all weekend while I did this other thing. I also paid the police people.\"],[\"There was a bright but soft golden glowing light coming and radiating but almost like floating into my apartment lighting up all the dark corners. It felt peaceful. Then I woke up and really had to pee!\"],[\"I was with someone I knew, maybe a friend or sister and we were sitting down and going to take a picture of ourselves, but no matter what I did I couldn't get the selfie thing right.\"],[\"I was in some kind of bad relationship and they wanted to keep me away from this guy and he was in jail maybe? I was with 2-3 other people, maybe peers like sisters or friends and we went to visit a museum and then were in the parking lot and I took them to the gift shop. I made several passes through with different people finding different little items. The last time I went I found this wall to wall display of weird ass flamingo pictures like twelve pictures arranged in rows. There were wall to wall crazy pictures of them walking and they looked ANGRY like if a flamingo could walk with arms/feathers around them and stalk and sulk. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me. I was a woman with a family and we had a garden and land and a greenhouse and neighbors. I had a little boy. It was green gray outside. We were watering the garden and there was a sonic BOOM and all of a sudden we could not water or share with our neighbors over the fence. It had stopped the water from being shared. Another part of the dream: Hooded people came. They were shooting at unarmed people in the neighborhood who were just gardening- boom boom! It looked like they were holding hoses but they were guns.\"],[\"My ex Rory and I are at some kind of party and there is all this fake jewelry and donated supplies for self care. I had already looked through it and realized some of it I donated last year (but in real life I\\u2019ve never seen before). It was time to go and I realized he had pimples to pop on his face that looked strange and they were like brown poop. It was so weird but he let me pop them (also not reality based) and they were full of brown squishy material. They were huge and on the side of his face. It was like that pimple popper show - haven\\u2019t seen it in years - but a satisfying feeling like that and also gross. It looked like poop.\"],[\"Images: Elevator. Parking garage and tip. Something else. Ram Dass\\u2019 face on a white board at work, and then lights out and his face on a candle. Wings on the ground.\"],[\"In my dream I woke up and I was in my apartment but it was the inverse layout and the lights were on. There was nothing on the walls, except there was this strange out of place headless glass bust on top of the TV. It was so out of place. I went to get water and felt like someone was there and things started falling out of the water tray but they were words and ideas not water. Later in this dream a PT I work with called to ask how to get her driver\\u2019s license and I consulted with Rory for some reason and I was annoyed by this. She said she was running late but on her way. I kept thinking, \\u201cWhere are we going and she needs to quarantine!\\u201d\"],[\"I went to a hipster cafe or something with my late husband Caleb but somehow also my ex Rory\\u2019s energy was there. He was impatient to order and he got his food ahead of me. It was 1300 when he ordered and got food and went to eat without me. I was waiting in line to order and then when it was my turn I didn\\u2019t know what I wanted and the people in line were upset and I got out of the way. When I finally ordered it was just a piece of cheese on bread, nothing else was appealing. I was worried about something the whole time like that he was mad at me or somehow this was my fault it was taking so long. Then he came back at the end and said, \\u201cI\\u2019m still waiting for you.\\u201d It looked like Caleb but the energy made me nervous and scared - more ex boyfriend Rory energy.\"],[\"I was at Esalen for something but there were lots of families staying there. We were kind of in pods away from others but I didn\\u2019t have a pod, it was just me and some other people who were way younger than me. At some point in the dream I got drunk on red wine, it was overflowing from a plastic margarita cup (I have no reference point for this) but I had just hooked up with a cute young guy (also totally out of character- the whole scene actually pretty ego dystonic for me). Later in that dream or a new dream, I was working on something and someone kept asking me to bring mural supplies to make a giant sign. They wanted this one kid to work on it and this annoyed me. I don\\u2019t know why maybe because someone was telling me what to do?\"],[\"I was with my sisters and my mom or a woman who represented my mom (who passed away when I was 20). We were like a group of Thelma and Louise type characters running from town to town and we were getting chased by police, there was even a water chase scene on jet skis. Then I woke up.\"],[\"Wandering around an older town \\u201cBirmingham\\u201d or something like that with rustic wood and cobblestone streets. My cell battery was 1% the whole time and I was trying to connect or find someone with a predetermined meeting. Later Patient C and my grandparents' old house in Virginia. I was trying to charge the phone and he took it from me and laughed but it wasn\\u2019t mean, it was playful. There was some kind of party but nobody was there.\"],[\"I was with Rory somewhere and we were sleeping in separate bedrooms but he kept sleepwalking in the middle of the night and then checking his hands when he would come home.\"],[\"It was dark icy blue kind of dark and I was in a room that was large and new to me, I was hiding from people and went from window to window making sure the blinds were closed and the deadbolt on the door was locked. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my friend Emily and she was pouring champagne into glasses and she had some pre-poured in her cupboard! However she drank first and then gave me one but it was a large round cup. I was disappointed it wasn\\u2019t a champagne flute but didn\\u2019t say anything. She said I could stay and watch a movie if I was lonely. I explained that I tried reaching my sisters but that they were busy. In my dream I saw an image of my sister Anne and her family dressed up like fancy Santa and elves and they were doing a family photo shoot and kind of snobbish. Then I went back to my other dream.\"],[\"I was taking a car to a parking lot that was also inside of a house. There were young black valets and I think they thought I was a \\u201cKaren.\\u201d I wanted them to know I wasn\\u2019t. I got out and went inside this house and it was HUGE and super nice and somehow mine. Not a reality for me. It had wide stairs but in order to go up, I had to go down and it was frustrating. When I finally got upstairs an alarm went off so I turned around to go downstairs and had to go up before I could go down! Then I woke up. The stairs were like pool table green with big mahogany bannisters.\"],[\"I was getting ready for work and a colleague was with her family showing up by the telephone pole in a neighborhood and her brother was like, \\u201chey I know you,\\u201d and it made me want to run away.\"],[\"My dream was a young black girl trying to enter my balcony. She looked at me in the eye and wanted something from me.\"],[\"I was renting a house for Christmas or beyond and I had my own decorations and furniture as well as the ones that were there. My sister Sarah arrived and was trying to help but was annoying me. She was asking if I did this or that and I just wanted to be left alone. I had a long handled lighter for a candle and couldn\\u2019t get it to work and it broke and was leaking fluid everywhere. Then I woke up annoyed.\"],[\"I was with my ex Rory, and we were traveling somewhere like doing a condo or a timeshare or something. When we got inside we were trying to close the blinds and they fell off and he was like, \\u201coh this happened when I was here before,\\u201d and I was like, \\u201coh that\\u2019s annoying.\\u201d The people who worked there were sitting outside looking through the window and not helpful at all, just rolling their eyes. He had shared that he\\u2019d been there before with his late wife and I was like, \\u201coh where are we?\\u201d and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was at work and I was there on a day off rushing to finish. I went to go do my charting and I sat down to listen. There\\u2019s water rushing up from the floor and I want to go save things off the floor and there was an extra computer on the chair.\"],[\"I was on the elevator with some work colleagues, but it was an elevator sometimes and like a subway. It looked like a big, sterile elevator sometimes but then at other times it looked like we are on this underground train that was white with everything silver around very sterile. We kept getting stuck and we couldn\\u2019t figure out how to get on and off of it. Somebody came to call out for us; it was this lady we work with and she was actually trying to keep us on it instead of getting us off it. Nobody knew the password. There was like this code to put in 3711 or something to help us get off and everybody was debating how to do it the right way. Somebody said that we\\u2019d all been in this situation before and we would figure it out everybody had their own way but nothing was working and then I woke up.\"],[\"We were at a big holiday party for work but at somebody\\u2019s house. There were maybe ten of us and it was all decorated for the holidays. We were celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah in the new year. Someone came that wasn\\u2019t supposed to come and started murdering all the Jewish people. It was really upsetting having people with guns. Then fast forward, I was at the same location and we were doing a world service. I sat in the front room with one of the attendings, Dr. Donovan. It was just three people in the front row -nher and me and somebody else on the left-hand side. I was scared and they were speaking another language.\"],[\"I was with my family and some extended family on my dad\\u2019s side. It was dark and we were going to a big football game. I was nervous about it and I wasn\\u2019t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn\\u2019t like him. I knew that it wasn\\u2019t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design. Everybody was commenting on how fast it was for the game but I was really nervous about going somewhere in public.\"],[\"Airbnb. Conference. A short fat white trans woman with a beehive wig tried to take my cab then shared with a shorter round man with brown hair, khaki suit. He hailed the same time for the taxi that I was taking to the next hotel. I could\\u2019ve walked but was in pain. It felt like was picking up on dreams that were not mine\"],[\"I was walking along a main street where everything was fucked up from water damage and my friend Emily had a shop that I didn\\u2019t know she had until then and it was ruined but it was like a paper shop and she needed to place these big bottles in front of the machines.\"],[\"There was another dream about something where I didn\\u2019t feel good and I left to go get a soft pretzel snack from a concession stand somewhere.\"],[\"I woke up in another dream where I was recovering at a house but the house was for sale, so I had to make it presentable. I\\u2019m trying to remember the details on this but I was also watching the interactions between a couple. There was a man and a woman who were together and he was trying to make friends with all of the single women at the party and make plans to see them and his wife was like, \\u201cdude take a break!\\u201d\"],[\"Then I had another dream where I was visiting. I think I was back home in Virginia and I needed to crash somewhere and I don\\u2019t know who the friend was but he was explaining to me that his relatives had this townhouse. They had just gotten it as a deal because the owner had died by suicide in the closet. Actually now that I\\u2019m thinking about it, it was my ex Rory and the people that live there were his mom and his stepdad, but it wasn\\u2019t them - it was definitely not them really - it was just like his mom\\u2018s voice was the lady. In any case the place was a disaster. There was food all over the floor and it was really unkempt with stains everywhere. They kept saying that the middle level of the townhouse was cold and that\\u2019s where the person had died by suicide in the closet. They kept making references to it like it was spooky and it just made me sad for the person that had been there before. It looked like the street I grew up in Virginia but it was townhouses instead of small houses. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was part of this elite group of athletes or team of race car drivers. We were all working out on mats lined up 3x2 facing each other. Then it was almost like the matrix; we were strapped into seats and I could see the tops of the cars and race track all black and blue and purple, almost animated looking. Someone went too far and made an illegal move and crashed. We were about to start an investigation when I woke up. I was with my best friend Aidan growing up - we barely keep in touch now. Anyways I was with her and we were at a place that was supposed to be my work now and getting ready for a sleepover. We saw Arshis and some of his family, so invited them. It was very platonic, matter of fact like, \\u201cwe are having this get together would you like to come?\\u201d\"],[\"I was at this rapper's house, a famous one, maybe P. Diddy, and we\\u2019re having this party. They took us out back to this private ocean. I went into the ocean and it was murky but he said that there were these reeds in it and even though they seemed weird because he would feel them underneath and they actually lifted you up. So we went into the water and music came on and at first I was going around with this guy - I don\\u2019t know who he was - and he wanted me to follow him but I didn\\u2019t. I just went my own way and the more I went my own way the more I twirled and the more Power I felt through my legs. It was incredible and I was climbing over the reeds and slithering but even that was powerful and I realize that the reeds were there to protect us and lift us up as well. I was unstoppable. I was just twirling and dancing and I was like a ballerina and Ballin\\u2019 and it was so lovely and so beautiful I never wanted to wake up from that.\"],[\"I was with somebody like a female friend, but I don\\u2019t really remember who. We were walking from somewhere together and there were all these steep hills one after the other. All of a sudden it was snowing and icy and we were really careful going down these really steep hills and talking about how they would gather speed. Then these people came up behind us and they\\u2019re kind of like these hicks. We overheard them saying things like, \\u201ccan you walk Jonas? Look at us.\\u201d I stopped to get these dollar deals on the side of the road and they had these weird covers and I was looking for them everywhere but they only had one pair. There was something that I had to talk to this other friend about before; it was weird. The roadside stand had all kinds of old travel gadgets.\"],[\"I was on this moving platform of things and my dad was there. I was embarrassed by him because there were other people I knew from work, like attendings etc.\"],[\"The last dream I had was more like a general dream I was with a bunch of other people I don\\u2019t really know in real life. We were cohesive and we went to celebrate something and we all wanted to go dance, like a line chorus line where you kick up your legs. We were going to go up on stage and get our picture taken\"],[\"I was a younger black teenager and I challenged my older brother to a fight and I knocked myself out into the wall. I was narrating like a movie.\"],[\"I was riding along as a passenger in an old beat up pick up truck. We stopped at this old town and got out. We walked inside this tiny little gift shop and it was like walking in circles. I couldn\\u2019t fit anywhere, it was like a doll house. There were boxes all over the floor and I kept thinking, \\u201cthis is not ADA compliant.\\u201d\"],[\"I was at work and my colleague erased my quote from the board...I wasn\\u2019t mad I was just confused\"],[\"I was moving out of a room or suite from my best friend Aidan\\u2019s house and she was helping me move. We have packed up all the boxes and are making sure we have everything. There are all these clear containers. Then I was getting dressed and she was carrying everything down faster than I could. When we walked out her mom was lounging around outside and there were all these stairs, lots and lots of stairs. I said a joke about how she was a Sherpa and it was really funny. Then Aidan and I went out somewhere and it was during the pandemic but we were in high school like we were when we were best friends and yet we were both wearing our work clothes for some reason and my badge had University Health care. It was hard to see and it said 9 to 5 and we went into this police station or Fireman's gym and they really go \\u201c95\\u201d like it was the call number for a place that they knew. I was embarrassed to tell them it was a particular university, but 925 meant something in the dream.\"],[\"I was in a yoga studio and crammed in trying to go to class and I couldn\\u2019t see the teacher and I was annoyed at the people around me because they were acting really immature.\"],[\"This dream was probably based on the movie I saw tonight before I went to bed: something about the vast of night. The dream was about carrying a family\\u2019s history in the car on the highway. My dream looks different than the movie but the idea was similar which was I was carrying the stories in a car and I went to go drop them off somewhere for someone\\u2019s family history.\"],[\"I was at Costco or something and I went to go check out a VHS or a CD movie and because of Covid he put the helmet on me, and then he put on a VR helmet.

The first time it flooded I didn\\u2019t want her to know so I cleaned it up and realized it was all over even the higher floors. It was dark in the house, too. The second time it flooded she was just out of the shower and I told her it was flooding and she panicked and told me to flip the switches and I couldn\\u2019t find them but I went around spraying the spray she told me to use. It was dark and there were a lot of staircases and rooms and children\\u2019s play stuff but the whole house was empty.

The girl who lived there came after me! In the end, we became friends. This chick knew things about my life that I've never told anyone. Maybe this girl was my shadow self?\"],[\"I had a dream about Cameron ... He came to comfort me and visit me in my dream.\"],[\"I had a dream about Atlantis and the ancestors of Atlantis (once the great civilization fell, the survivors scattered the earth to share their knowledge, so that the wisdom would survive their destruction). My dream focused on the journey of a group of the fallen from Atlantis to their new home: AVALON.\"],[\"I dreamt that I overslept, like all the way until 4 PM, only because I slept so badly, or so I dreamed. I was so upset at everyone for ditching me and going snowboarding without me. Then I thought that I missed work! I awoke, not hungover, relieved and ready to ride!\"],[\"I had a dream that my husband and I were running a business together with my best friend (a house flipping/remodeling business, and it was successful), when I caught them together and discovered that she was pregnant. I learned shortly afterward that he was leaving me for her and their baby. I packed my stuff and took over, devastated, and realized that I was in Santa Barbara, driving a yellow bug which I know I don't own in real life. This made me aware that I was dreaming, and I began to feel a deep heartbreak combined with a sense of divine freedom.\"],[\"\\u201cGonna Go Swimming at a Hotel\\u201d Mirrored wall in front of lobby. Mom went to change into a swimsuit. On her way out, her reflection was from 15 minutes prior, in the outfit that she changed from. There was a lag in the reflection. She showed it to me and we kept freaking out about it and testing it over and over again. We realized we had to leave because we had been doing this for hours. Went up the escalator and the door at the top was closed and we all were getting jammed at the top.\"],[\"Last night I dreamt that the new iPhone came out and it was like a retro flip phone and I felt cheated by it I mean I bought it I think I had one in my hand and my husband had one and we\\u2019re at a party and somebody else had one and actually this guy took his out put it on the table and then when he did I thought oh my gosh what is that old flip phone and then I remembered that I had one so I reached into my pocket and I pulled it out and I was kind of messing with it and my husband took his out and said merry Christmas or whatever so I guess he had surprised me with it and I was really underwhelmed I was disappointed and it was a weird feeling to be disappointed I felt really shallow and petty observing my feelings about this inanimate object.\"],[\"At my childhood home there is a family reunion from a few families that are important to me. (In waking life I don\\u2019t know these families). A friend John who is in love with me invited his family to meet me, but I am married. He introduces me to the room of people and says we have a lot of history and I balk because it implies something romantic that never was. (In real life he was a high school crush and a pen pal after he moved away). I feel embarrassed and want to confront him but not humiliate him. I wander around and mingle with guests and don\\u2019t confront the friend. I fly to China for the marathon but leave mid way through to Iceland airwaves and to do a kayak trip around the island. I don\\u2019t finish the race either. I go to my favorite shop in Iceland and there\\u2019s a t-shirt that says we\\u2019re having a baby and it\\u2019s a picture of a tiger and a bird and the baby is a monkey. I go to lunch and my best friend Bea is there and we embrace. (In waking life we recently had a falling out). I tell her I sold the business and that I got invited to join a matchmaking service but I\\u2019m married so I don\\u2019t want to go. I panic about getting home and also back to China to finish work because I bought a one way ticket. I call to stay with a friend Julia (who I also had an argument with last year and want to patch things up). Julia picks me up and she tells me she finished the half marathon and she is in recovery from it still.\"],[\"I was on a cruise or some kind of family summer camp and had played a few rounds of an interactive scavenger hunt - I think something active maybe paintball and I sat down at a table with a family that I know and then there was a family that I didn\\u2019t know. The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn\\u2019t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I\\u2019ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn\\u2019t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn\\u2019t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn\\u2019t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn\\u2019t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.\"],[\"I was in a tiny house with my husband that was glass (or mostly glass: had a lot of windows). And there was a HUGE dog outside with a cat on its back and they were running around the house. Then three wolves came and everyone was running around us. We weren\\u2019t that scared but maybe a little. Mostly excited about the cat riding the dog.\"],[\"There was a stranger squatting in the guest house on the far end of my property. The guest house was a little dilapidated and needed lots of work. But there were three beautiful white Lily bushes growing outside of it. It\\u2019s a house I\\u2019ve seen before in a dream. I knew the guy was there but I couldn\\u2019t explain how I knew, I just felt it. No one believed me. I went out one day to confirm my suspicions. I saw the reflection in the window of someone behind me and I turned and no one was there. A tall cowboy western looking guy in a blue flannel. I looked in the window and saw him again and when I turned around he was there with his wife and daughter and they walked away together really floaty and turned around to look at me once. They were ghosts. I was nervous but I went into the house and I saw someone sleeping. I got scared and ran all the way home and he was running behind me. I got inside and closed the door and he stood there begging to talk. So I talked to him and he was actually really nice and asked if he could help fix it up in exchange for living there for a year. I thought that seemed fair. He had a job and was saving all his money to marry his girlfriend. I agreed but didn\\u2019t tell anyone that lived with me about the arrangements. I went out to the pool and my kitties were swimming in it. There was a baby pony near the pool. I swam with the kitties. There was a swing set on the hill above the pool. And there was an eerie feeling about it. My niece was playing on it. I called her over to swim with the kitties and to look at the pony. I don\\u2019t think she listened.\"],[\"Dreamt I was in a very strange house. It looked like a cheap Korean spa\\u2014beautiful materials were used like jade flooring but it was damp and the floor uneven and I had vertigo. I had invited my mom and sister and niece to live with me. There was a noise in the downstairs portion of the house and it was a child that was completely deranged/a monster really. It had a gun and was shooting at us. I got a gun and I was fumbling with it, I was so scared! I dropped it and it rolled down the floor (very sloped uneven floor). I ran to it and tripped and almost had it when the monster was standing over me with the gun. I shouted \\u201cbehind you!!\\u201d And the baby turned and shot my mom! I felt so guilty it was my fault I ran to her and the baby was still shooting. I got the gun and shot it. It rolled very gruesomely all the way down the uneven floor to the door and down the stairs. It was horrific and bloody. And my mom and this random monster baby were dead and I had to do something but I knew no one would believe what happened! I had to make up a lie blaming my mom for it all. I didn\\u2019t want to do it and I forced myself awake.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room. The paint on the walls was old and chipping and the carpet was raggedy. I gave her some art and she loved it but wanted to take it somewhere to be finished.

Staff kind of found me locked in the hallway with posters, I was staging a protest the following day. I had a million bags and posters and markers and nothing was organized. I felt really flustered.

This is a love story, though not a waking life idea of a love story. Traveling through Asia as a college kid, following in with an anarchist gang and getting into a lot of trouble. Fleeing a penitentiary sentence I escaped to an island and found my true love. He didn\\u2019t believe in marriage or monogamy and I found space to allow his love in my life and not have it be the center of my life. I accepted his conditions. I raised our child kind of solo with him in and out for long periods of time. He ran a hostel on the beach which is where I met him. There was never a sentiment of hate or resentment. At some point I decided to leave the island with my kid and travel back to the states and settled down there for a while. When the child grew up I returned to my nomadic Ways and wandered back to the island. There were no phones or anything like that but I found my love at the hostel and we settled in together there until he died. This dream spanned from age 18 to 70. I was grateful for what I had. I didn\\u2019t control or expect anything, which is weird, because it is not how I am in waking life. I woke up missing him. I accepted a lot of limitations, particularly with my lover, and surrendered to it - having a beautiful life with and without him. I chose love over what I thought was due to me.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room. The paint on the walls was old and chipping and the carpet was raggedy.

The son is seen (even by me initially as the viewer) as short chubby and lazy who drains resources and who relies on his parents. In reality he is extremely depressed and unhealthy and needs help with his life. He works at a company for 10 years for 2 hours a day. He has 2 friends. Me as an omniscient character and this other guy he works with who got him the job. Both of us childhood friends.

I was supposed to sell the houses to new members of the community. It was all brown people from different ethnic backgrounds. I was taught how to do the job but I wasn\\u2019t doing it well. There was this Beautiful man, Naveen Andrews, that lives there and he was helping me get acclimated. There were seminars every day in the courtyard. Everyone was so calm and collected and moved so gracefully. I didn\\u2019t. My stuff was everywhere. My motorcycle was in the middle of the impeccably landscaped garden and I had to move it out during a seminar and it was so distracting and noisy and awkward. I had my first tour I was giving and I had all the paperwork for each person and they all were completely different but I could only remember one name and I kept calling them all the same name, Sheera. I was so embarrassed. I sold one house to one of the people who was In love with Naveen. She also hated me for being so close with him.\"],[\"I become instantly aware of needing to be at a precise location at a specific time and do a specific task. I do it and it doesn\\u2019t seem like much. I arrive at my final exam presentation and instead of speaking, I need to dance to a specific song. It\\u2019s a dramatic ballet. After the performance, I become aware that I have just shaped the future/changed the future. I receive awareness/communication within myself that I have changed the course of history by this act, a classmate is forever changed by the dance and is influenced by art instead and he no longer becomes an evil politician but rather a philanthropist of the arts. It happened again, I was to meet at a bar at a hotel and talk to someone sitting there. I did. We talked about how I was so depressed but then got help and it changed the way I interacted with my own trauma. I gave him the number of my therapist and I became aware that instead of suicide bombing the town at the end of the year, this man I spoke to would fall in love at the end of the year. I started following all of these instincts, knowing I was shaping a better future through small acts of kindness, love, passion, art. It became all consuming. I saw someone having a conversation and I became aware that they were receiving the same kind of transmissions as I had been. I kind of kept an eye on them and eventually they asked if I was following them. I asked why they were doing the things they were doing and eventually we realized we were on the same mission. Soon, we had formed a whole community of receivers. We had meetings and at one meeting I remember bringing the issue to the table that my old self and motivations and trajectories were so changed, like I had died and replaced by prescience. I still had my own memories from before but I was sharing my self and body with this prescience that had nothing to do with me as my own person. We didn\\u2019t find a solution but we did mourn and grieve our lives and tried to find ways to remember and be ourselves.\"],[\"Old style cottage farmhouse. No barn. Half underground. A gathering of farmers. And then there was me, a researcher. I take over research from my predecessor. No talk of who that was or where they left off or where I was to start. Joyous and also conspiratory. Conversations hushed when I\\u2019d come in. There was something everyone knew that I didn\\u2019t. No one was unwelcoming or overly welcoming but something was amiss. Something subtle. There was a small Market across the street, the only place to get food but we were a farm so it was confusing. What were we farming? I remember wondering why there wasn\\u2019t a barn and asking about it. I was in a place of questioning everything, a feeling of excitement and also of distrust. There was a knowing that my aunt's house was close and that I\\u2019d grown up seeing the farmhouse. The overall feeling of the dream was eerie, even if the actual events weren\\u2019t blatantly so.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a house and step out into the backyard to join a small group of 2 or 3 people. We\\u2019re standing in the grass and see that someone has spread out a huge white blanket over the lawn. In the middle of the blanket is a big pile of dog shit, and I\\u2019m like, what\\u2019s this?! We share this backyard with neighbors that live in the house behind us. So I decide to go over and see if I can find one of the neighbors. One of them is a guy in his late twenties. He\\u2019s sitting in a makeshift house, like a playhouse for kids, really simple with just cutouts for doors and windows and nothing else really. He\\u2019s sitting inside with his didgeridoo and his flute and he says yeah, the dog had a stomach upset and has been shitting all day, but he doesn\\u2019t volunteer to help clean up. I don\\u2019t recall how I respond, but I end up leaving and walking back to the house. As I do this, I step in a pile of liquidy dog poop. I don\\u2019t have any shoes on and I can feel that liquidy shit on the sole of my left foot. Then I see that somebody has pushed the blanket together towards the middle but the poop is still there in the center, so that has to be taken care of. I walk back inside. My mom is upstairs in the bathroom. I go into the kitchen and Mary is there. She offers me this saline mister spray with medicinal properties for your food. So I spray my food but I\\u2019m not sure that it gets into the food because it is misting into the air. Then she is pushing a little black pill up into my left nostril. I don\\u2019t know what it is, but I trust her. For a moment I wonder if it is some kind of drug that will send me on a weird trip? But, then I know that it is herbs based on a healing tea that will help me breathe easier. Right then, my son wakes me up, but I can still feel that I can breathe easily through my left nostril.\"],[\"Construction on the inside of a building.

I have taken off my adornments and placed them at the top of the mat and they\\u2019re almost in Ursula's in space, so she gives me this look and so I in a really apologetic way move them over to the side and hide away in a bit of shame for that. Again I\\u2019m not able to stand in my true power and be myself in her presence. There's a direction from somewhere, someone telling us to remove our clothes. We are all wearing these beautiful silk flowing gowns. Nobody moves at first. It\\u2019s an odd direction and we don\\u2019t know where it\\u2019s coming from. Then Ursula who is across from me on a mat steps forward in this really seductive way starts to slip off her dress. Two women on either side who are studying with her are her attendants and they help her remove her gown and all of her underthings. Then everyone else proceeds to do so. I feel like, oh gosh I have to also and so I remove my outer gown, but I keep on my underwear because I haven\\u2019t waxed and I\\u2019m feeling pretty shameful about that. So I\\u2019m left wearing a black thong. Then I\\u2019m in a room and one of my husband\\u2019s friends is lying on a couch. He\\u2019s 7 feet tall - a really big guy - and he\\u2019s kind of joking around. He says something that agitates me. I climb up onto him and start to pound on him in a playful way. And I say, \\u201cYou know I never really do this with anybody else, but you\\u2019re so big and it just seems okay to do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s laughing and he thinks it\\u2019s a funny thing, too. Then I\\u2019m in a building and I\\u2019m talking to this very wealthy man - a billionaire, creative person who I don\\u2019t know in waking life. My husband\\u2019s friend in the previous scene is also a very wealthy man. He\\u2019s talking about his vision for what he wants to create and bring me along with it. We are in a glass skyscraper type building and we see King Kong. King Kong is smashing buildings and it seems like he\\u2019s looking for this guy I\\u2019m with. He sees us through the window and comes toward us. We\\u2019re frantically trying to run away - run up the stairs or run down the stairs and get out of the building. And the building is crashing around us. I run downstairs into a hallway and I see an arrow pointing to a sign with a name - Beth. Beth is a friend of mine in town - she\\u2019s a counselor. So I see an arrow to her house and I run to find her. She\\u2019s there and she walks with me to the top of the stairs. She stays with my son in a stroller at the top of the stairs. I run down the stairs. I have to go to the bathroom. I end up in this Japanese style bathroom with all these automatic toilets that I have lights and sing songs. You\\u2019re supposed to go to the bathroom in a particular way and push the right buttons so it cleans you in a particular way. So I do, but just as I\\u2019m finishing up, a whole group of photographers are standing right outside the door. They walk in and I\\u2019m not fully dressed again. I\\u2019m feeling ashamed of being caught with my pants down.\"],[\"I am with a small group of people and we are climbing up a very steep rock. We get to a point where the rock opens up and you can see down into a deep crevice, but you can\\u2019t see the bottom because it\\u2019s so deep. Most of us have made it across. One woman who was an acquaintance from middle school, Anne, is there. She\\u2019s stretching her leg out to get across the black hole and she doesn\\u2019t make it. We all watch her horrified, seeing her fall and fall until we can\\u2019t see her. Then we hear some flapping and a bird/woman has caught her and is lifting her up from the depths.\"],[\"I see an absolutely gorgeous man and decide that he will be my lover. He is perfectly shaped and poised. I am deeply attracted to him. He reminds me of the first man I fell in love with nearly 20 years ago. I\\u2019m semi-lucid and keep rearranging the scenes, repeating moments to get them just right and perfect so I can be with him. In one of the scenes, we are in a big room with many beds of all different sizes. He has one bed and the other beds are for others. I somehow make all the beds shift over to one side of the room. My intention is to have our bed separate from the others. Then I look over and see him sitting next to me on a bench. We\\u2019re on the same side of the room with the cluster of beds all pushed up next to each other. The other side of the room is empty and it feels unbalanced. So I erase the scene and start all over again. There are other scenes I can\\u2019t recall. Now we are in a grassy field like a baseball field - this is the last one. I go up to him and brush my lips against his skin. He\\u2019s not wearing a shirt. I indicate that I am interested and wanting more even though I\\u2019m married. I love the warmth and heat of being so close to him.\"],[\"I am walking on a sidewalk with my husband and see a pile of packages ready to be mailed. They\\u2019re addressed to our parents and from our friend Sherry. I think it\\u2019s such a nice gesture that she bought presents for our parents and we didn\\u2019t even think to. We see that one package is not fully wrapped. It\\u2019s a cake and waffles. We nibble the waffles and love them! We eat around the perimeter and hope it doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019ve been snacking on their gift. Then I\\u2019m with my husband and his family - dad, step-mom and step-sisters. We\\u2019re standing in a circle and they are passing around the beautiful cake that Sherry sent. They cut different sized slices and Krista takes an extra large slice - it\\u2019s so big there isn\\u2019t enough for everyone. Either I or my son grab the cake from her and start to eat. She\\u2019s upset, but the rest of the group says \\u201cno, they need cake, too.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful cake with orange frosting, different layers and textures. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in the same room, but it\\u2019s later in the day. I\\u2019m alone with my son. My husband\\u2019s dad walks in but he looks like a zombie, as if he\\u2019s been in a car accident. He\\u2019s completely bald and white pale and his face is streaming with blood. Then a younger version of my husband\\u2019s dad comes in with blood streaming down his face, too.\"],[\"My husband is teaching a class, but the attendees are all potted plants in plastic NICU incubators. Then I\\u2019m in a big hotel. My husband has engaged the services of a male escort. He\\u2019s really looking forward to this man because he\\u2019s a very good kisser. But the man\\u2019s body is so distorted - he\\u2019s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I\\u2019m not happy about the situation but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He\\u2019s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we\\u2019re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I\\u2019m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it\\u2019s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can\\u2019t recall much more. Then we\\u2019re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter. I\\u2019m really upset that he\\u2019s breathing on me and that these people walked into our dining room obviously sick and just off a plane or boat. The scene shifts. I\\u2019m outside walking along a marina. There is shallow water with rocks like tidepools. I look down into the water and see two black and white cats curled together in a circle. They are all wet. I think it\\u2019s odd that the cats are so pleasantly sleeping floating on the water. I keep walking and see a couple drenched yellow chicks. I wonder if they\\u2019ve drowned or if they\\u2019re also sleeping. Then I see a turkey struggling on its back in the water between rocks. I see pigs doing the same along with some other animals. It\\u2019s a very odd scene.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we\\u2019re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I\\u2019m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I\\u2019m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That\\u2019s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I\\u2019m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There\\u2019s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I\\u2019m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, \\u201cI was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.\\u201d She lists the women, but I don\\u2019t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it\\u2019s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don\\u2019t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It\\u2019s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He\\u2019s playing with the water from the fridge. He\\u2019s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I\\u2019m concerned that I don\\u2019t have anyone to take care of him and that he\\u2019s disturbing the session. But my client doesn\\u2019t seem to notice or care that he\\u2019s interfering.\"],[\"I have tickets to go to a show and the show is tonight. Before going to the show, I go to a bar and meet up with some friends. Then I go back to the house - it\\u2019s a communal house that I share with a lot of different people. I decide to go to the show. I stop at a health/art fair. People are getting their hair and makeup done, and I wait to have mine done, too. I wander around looking at art. There are huge beautiful pieces and odd pieces. People are wandering around looking, too. Then I look at the time and I realize I need to get the show. It\\u2019s 11pm but still twilight. I realize I am too late for the show.\"],[\"I am at a building that appears to be an unemployment office, though it\\u2019s more of a nice community center and rest stop along a highway. I\\u2019m filing for unemployment and looking for support. While I\\u2019m inside, I look out the window at my car. My car is a convertible and the top is off. A man is sitting in the passenger seat. He\\u2019s scruffy and older looking of mixed ethnicity - at one point he seems Chinese and another African. I make a move towards the car to tell him to get out, but then he slides a gun across his lap and points it toward me. The gun is upside down and pointed at me as a warning to stay back. So I don't say anything to him. I go back inside and a woman notices that I\\u2019m disturbed. She asks me about it, but she can do nothing to help me. So I\\u2019m at a loss. The dream shifts to the next day at the same time. I\\u2019m waiting for help. He happens to be inside, too. The woman who I spoke with yesterday comes out and apologizes to me that we are here at the same time and that he could be near me. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it, it\\u2019s okay. He doesn\\u2019t seem to be threatening today.\\u201d I notice that he\\u2019s just standing there, leaning against a wall, trying to get help, too. Then I wander around. At the back, there is an outdoor patio and some of my friends are there. One of my friends suggests we have a glass of wine. So we go to order wine. There are so many choices, but no menu. So we have to guess and give words to the man serving the wine, describing the taste profile or experience we desire. He pulls out a bag of sarsaparilla and cloves and holds it open for us to smell. We enjoy the smell and he gives us a mason jar of red wine that has this flavor profile. While he\\u2019s serving us, he tells us that he used to have a job that paid $35/hour and he misses that regular pay because now he is just living on tips. We thank him and each pay him $5 for the wine and $1 tip. He says again, \\u201cI still wish I had that job where I was getting paid 35 a month.\\u201d I think, \\u201cHmm a month? Didn\\u2019t you see 35 an hour? 35 a month is not a lot.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say anything, though. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m walking through a building. It appears to be a school. It\\u2019s on complete lockdown and all the doors are bolted - some are bolted shut and others are locked partially open. The halls are completely empty. The rooms are emptying. I\\u2019m carrying a glass of red wine in my hand, peering into windows and rooms. As I\\u2019m walking down one hallway, a naked and very full woman is walking towards me with a swaddled baby. It appears she has just given birth. We nod at each other, but say nothing as we pass. She\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen so far. I turn left and am walking down a hallway. I peer through a doorway and see a woman dressed in black. She\\u2019s squatting as if giving birth, but she\\u2019s already given birth. Her baby is on the floor beside her. She is wailing and keening. The carpet under her mouth is soaking wet with tears, saliva and snot. She is retching and I can\\u2019t tell if she\\u2019s actually throwing up. I walk past and then turn back. Now this same room is full of mothers who have recently given birth. This is a support meeting for them being facilitated by my midwife. I go in but am embarrassed to have red wine and put it on the desk. I leave, but forget my wine. I go back, but can\\u2019t find it on the dresser where I had placed it. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a very nice house with a loft where I have been sleeping and resting. I climb down the ladder and see one of my roommates from freshman year of college. She tosses me a baby food pack of pureed vegetables. It\\u2019s nearly empty, but I\\u2019m grateful to even have that little bit. The car from earlier in the dream has now been given to my brother-in-law. Now he has two cars - one for work and the convertible for the weekend and picking up girls.\"],[\"A store after hours. It\\u2019s been closed for a while now. People are gathering here at night, unlocking the door and huddling close inside. Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I\\u2019m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I\\u2019m not really welcome because I\\u2019m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won\\u2019t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I\\u2019m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.\"],[\"I am a passenger in a vehicle of some kind, I think it\\u2019s a train. I\\u2019m with other people and we are looking for our home. It\\u2019s night outside. We\\u2019re going past some pick-yards filled with old smashed up cars. Then we end up at a huge mansion in this cute little town. We walk in because it is our new home. I am most impressed with the kitchen. I love it because there are three different sitting choices - a half moon table at the end of the island with a couple chairs; a longer rectangle dark wood table for 6; and a pretty shiny off-white round breakfast nook with soft pillows on the two benches. To the right of the kitchen is a big formal sitting room and dining area. The dining table is large and gleaming white. It only sits 4. The chairs have mossy soft green cushions and the place settings are lovely - silver and cream with gold, soft green napkins. There is a fireplace with antlers on the mantel. It\\u2019s very nice, elegant, cozy and inviting. Off to the side of this large room is a small library/consultation room. Later in the dream, my mom has returned from a trip into town. She has a towel wrapped around her head as if she\\u2019s just come out of the shower. She is having a counseling consultation with a woman. The house is surrounded by a lot of space. I\\u2019m walking with my friend and housemate (I don\\u2019t recognize her from waking life). She steps on a dry place with branches and fallen leaves. The ground gives way a bit and we look at each other, astonished, and I tell her: \\u201cKeep walking!\\u201d As she keeps carefully walking, the ground continues to give way and we see that it is a mote without any water in it. The mote was dug around this house many many years ago. We are astonished. We look at each other and remember: We\\u2019ve lived in this home in a past life. This house has always been in our family and it is right that we have returned. So we continue to walk, moving the ground away with our steps and remembering/revealing this mote. Now I have to go into town for an errand. I\\u2019m a passenger in a car. The town reminds me of the outer parts of San Francisco where I used to live. I\\u2019m going to meet people for ice cream. At first I just order a regular ice cream cone. But then I see that the other people have chosen a crispy cookie cone. When I look at theirs, I want it because mine is just this soggy flour burrito wrap. I ask for the crispy cookie cone and they look at the board to calculate the cost. My order comes with four layers and each cone is $3, so it will be an additional $12. I think that\\u2019s too expensive and just take the regular one. It\\u2019s not very appetizing and I don\\u2019t love it but I eat it anyway. Now I\\u2019m being driven back with a realtor and I look out to see the windmill - it has been lit up with white lights and is sparkling and beautiful against the night sky and dark ocean. The realtor points out that they had to take away all the historic sculptures from the beach because the big giant peach was cracked and needed to be renovated. So they decided to renovate all the pieces that used to be in the carnival at the beach. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s sad they had to take those away.\\u201d I look out the window to the left and see that a house has been torn down. But they\\u2019re building a new house out of bottle caps. I\\u2019m amazed at this bottle cap house. On the way back to the house, we see a wonderful field and imagine going there to play and eat lunch. I know it will be a wonderful place to live.\"],[\"\\u201cA Seaworthy Vessel\\u201d I have built a big raft for the ocean with a group of about 5. There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there\\u2019s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It\\u2019s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I\\u2019m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I\\u2019m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don\\u2019t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They\\u2019re all great and I love them all. I\\u2019m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don\\u2019t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I\\u2019m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I\\u2019m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he\\u2019s pointing out. It\\u2019s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I\\u2019m in a shop. It is Jeremy\\u2019s shop. It\\u2019s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It\\u2019s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race. So we set a trajectory...\"],[\"I didn\\u2019t want to remember this dream. I wanted to forget it. I woke feeling paralyzed by fear of being abandoned. I am lying in the back of a car with my husband. The seats have been folded down so we can lie flat. He is naked. I am wearing a sweatshirt, leggings and shoes. They aren\\u2019t real leggings because my pelvis is bare. I\\u2019m offering my body, but still holding back with reluctance. There is a coldness about him, his body saying, \\u201cNope, I\\u2019m done.\\u201d I feel fear, despair, total abandonment come over my whole body. In another scene I\\u2019m walking into a building with Jack. He is in waking life and in this dream, a relationship counselor. We walk in and look through the window of a door into a classroom. I see three men on yoga mats and a fourth teaching. In the next room, my husband is co-teaching with our friend, Sherry. There is a big group of people doing a practice involving rubbing their knuckles along their foreheads. I\\u2019m surprised there are so many people when they were only expecting a few. Jack tells me that the group next door was supposed to have a bigger class, but cut back to only 4, so the remaining people decided to take class with my husband and Sherry. It\\u2019s good to see my husband doing his thing and having success in his role as a teacher. Then in another scene, I\\u2019m at a wedding ceremony or vow renewal for my husband and me. When it comes time for me to kiss my husband again, he has a basket of papers and a basket of flowers. Other people are around. He pretends to draw me in, but rejects me, turning away at the time of the kiss. There is a sense that I\\u2019ve done something horribly wrong and he\\u2019s gone now. There is also a health fair that we were supposed to be in, but got cancelled.\"],[\"I am at a teahouse - it reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco. I\\u2019m enjoying tea with a man and looking at his hands to see if he is wearing a wedding band. I have a memory of walking and talking with him and seeing a wedding ring. Now, his left ring finger is bare and his right ring finger has a silver band. Then I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walk in and am so disgusted. There is diarrhea all over the floor and big sticky gobs of shit everywhere - toilet seat and floor - and an especially disgusting yellow mucousy looking one dripping off the handicap bar. There is toilet paper strewn all over, too. I still have to pee. I end up getting shit on my hand. Then I\\u2019m trapped in this repeated portion of the dream, where I am trying to pull my pants up. I have one of my son\\u2019s diapers on and as I\\u2019m pulling the pants and diaper up, I keep smearing poop on the outside of the diaper\\u2019s right panel. It\\u2019s gross. I\\u2019m trying to repeat the scene in the dream to make the poop disappear, rather than deal with cleaning it up. I am in this bathroom with all this shit for a really long time. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m at a restaurant, sitting at a table all by myself. I\\u2019m looking out across the other tables and I see an acquaintance, Liz, and her husband. She is wearing a revealing black and red snake skin dress that displays her body and all her tattoos. She\\u2019s also wearing high red shoes. She\\u2019s flaunting her body. She\\u2019s looking back and forth at me and my husband. I see that my husband is sitting at a table near her. My husband is sitting with another person - this person is both the man I was enjoying tea with and a woman, somehow. Liz has a haughty look about her, assuming things aren\\u2019t going well with my husband because I\\u2019m sitting alone and my husband is enjoying the company of another person for dinner. Liz gets up and walks around to my husband\\u2019s table to say hello. All the while, her chin is lifted and she\\u2019s looking back and forth between my husband and me in this \\u201cknowing\\u201d way. It\\u2019s extremely uncomfortable. Her husband is also looking back and forth, more curious than haughty. The dream shifts again and I\\u2019m in a store. I have two massage tables set up near each other. I\\u2019m on probation and they\\u2019re deciding whether to imprison me or not. A man comes in - he\\u2019s the one who makes the decision. He lies down on one of the tables. Another woman who is also in charge is on the other table and the tables are actually right next to each other. We move the tables apart a bit. I massage his neck and head. He gets up to take care of some work. I tell him his scalenes and upper trapezius muscles were very tight, and I tell him what I did. Even though the work was good, they decide to imprison me. They lock me up in a room. At first I\\u2019m quiet but then after they leave, I bang on the door. The man from the tea house is there on the other side of the door. I ask him to help me, but he won\\u2019t.\"],[\"It\\u2019s a summer night. I\\u2019m doing work for Edward.. There\\u2019s a cottage with a garden. He sends me out with garden shears and a request to find five poles. I go out into the garden and I walk all the way out to the far end where there is a fence. I see five wooden poles lined up along the fence and pressed into the soil, standing up. I wonder if I\\u2019m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they\\u2019re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They\\u2019re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest. We\\u2019re all looking into the dirt. It\\u2019s a fascinating garden walk in the night. He finds a big snail with a grey-silver spiral shell. He taps lightly on the shell with a stick to show us. Then there\\u2019s something about talking cats. In another scene, I\\u2019m possibly in danger. It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m running, running, running. I\\u2019m dancing as part of a dance company. We\\u2019re rehearsing. I\\u2019m in the locker room getting ready to dance, but also scared to be found.\"],[\"I am in Elizabeth\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the house I\\u2019ve always known since I was young. We\\u2019ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I\\u2019ve brought isn\\u2019t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, \\u201cSee how tall the ceiling is?! It\\u2019s always been this tall.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYes, so tall!\\u201d Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can\\u2019t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn\\u2019t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she\\u2019ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, \\u201cOh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I\\u2019ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.\\u201d She\\u2019s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I\\u2019m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day. When I go to her office this time, it\\u2019s different. There are walls around the office. She\\u2019s there, but the bears are not.\"],[\"My husband has just come home. As he was walking under a bridge, a woman slid her hand down his leg. He stopped and had sex with her. He comes back and tells me as if it were fine. I am livid. I get aggressive in my words and actions. I poke him really hard in the ribs and push him back. He is turning me into the person in the wrong. I am so angry that he would do this and act like it is okay because it happened under the bridge and she invited the encounter.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching as a group of people are training for combat. It seems to be a private army. Brad Pitt jumps into the courtyard. He confronts the leader. He says he wants to meet him in hand to hand combat. So the leader agrees. They begin this extreme demonstration of skill. Brad Pitt is wearing a big black trench coat and a mask. The guy tells him that he cannot let go while they are shaking. There\\u2019s an odd moment where the two men are in a firm grip, apparently shaking hands, but jaws clenched, muscles rigid, and sweating. All of a sudden, the leader whirls Brad Pitt across the courtyard. He hits a huge door, but then picks up a hose and sprays the leader down with high pressure. He is then accepted into the tribe.\"],[\"I am outside walking my bike with my husband through a park. We go inside and it\\u2019s close to an appointment time that I need to make. I have to get something for my bike, but can\\u2019t remember what it is. I\\u2019m on the second floor of a huge bike shop. My husband is with me. I take my bike all the way down the hallway. I\\u2019m looking at baskets. Suddenly my bike has disappeared. I haven\\u2019t seen anybody. I haven\\u2019t gone anywhere. It\\u2019s just gone. Then I start to panic because I need my bike to get to my appointment on time. I run back down the hall. My husband is right behind me now. I say, \\u201cMy bike has disappeared!\\u201d He\\u2019s helping me look everywhere. We\\u2019re looking and looking and we can\\u2019t find it. It\\u2019s just vanished. We go downstairs and there are people standing in line to buy their things. I cut right to the front of the line in my panic. There are three cash registers checking people out. One person waves her hand and I step right up to her. I tell her what's happened. She says, \\u201cOh no, we\\u2019ll look for it. What\\u2019s your name? I\\u2019ll make a note of it here. I\\u2019ll give you a call. In the meantime, do you want to buy a bike or something?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cNo. I just need to go.\\u201d My husband and I go out. Now it\\u2019s pouring rain and it\\u2019s dark because it\\u2019s night. I can\\u2019t even imagine riding my bike in this heavy rain and through all the puddles. I\\u2019m still really upset because I\\u2019ll be late. I may have already missed the appointment.\"],[\"My son is in an outdoor hot tub jacuzzi. I go over to get in with him and see there is shit everywhere in the water. It\\u2019s not his. It was just floating in the tub. There are other people in the hot tub - random people from a dance company. They are talking about their dance company. They ask me why I haven\\u2019t left the company that I\\u2019ve joined yet. They ask, \\u201cHasn\\u2019t it been enough? Why do you still stay?\\u201d I step in to try and get my son out. He submerses himself under the water. Now it\\u2019s worse because I\\u2019m afraid he could be ingesting this poop water. There\\u2019s a moment of panic when I try to get him from under the water. He\\u2019s younger than he is now - probably 9 months or so. I scoop him up out of the water. The poop has not only been stirred up in the water, but is now stuck to my legs, arms and hands. I\\u2019m trying to keep hold of my son while washing the shit off. It\\u2019s turned into a facial mask consistency - slimy and fully stuck on me. I\\u2019m absolutely disgusted. I get out and I still have this on me. We have to get dressed. Now we\\u2019re walking down a street through a neighborhood to downtown. There are a lot of other people walking on the street, too - actually walking in the middle of the street because it has been closed to vehicle traffic. There are quite a few homeless people with shopping carts and random plastic bags of things loitering around and quite dirty. We have to stop at a stoplight. Then we keep on going. We end up at a food stand and order food to go. I\\u2019m with my husband and my son now. They give us our food in a to-go bag. The plastic bag has a knot in the top to hold it closed and trying not to touch more of it because I don\\u2019t know how clean the bag is and I don't want to contaminate the food. I don\\u2019t want to be contaminated and I don\\u2019t want to contaminate the food, myself. We keep on walking and end up at a food truck place with multiple vendors. At one stand, they are doing a cooking demonstration. They are making an amazing wrap with long filets of salmon and cucumber and a wonderful lemongrass sauce. They are demonstrating the creation of this food. My son and I are watching as my husband goes to wash his hands. I\\u2019m holding the other food and regretting that we bought it before we knew about this food. The salmon dish looks delicious. I notice my husband has been gone for a long time. I go looking for him. I can\\u2019t find him anywhere. Finally I see a round table with all our stuff on it - our wet clothes laid out on the table and over the chairs. Our bag is on the chair, too. I\\u2019m relieved to see that the clothes are out to dry. He returns while we settle in to eat.\"],[\"I am walking through the woods with a group of people. Tad is there in this group, too. He lingers towards the back and I slow down to linger with him. We walk closer together and brush shoulders and hands as we talk. He pulls me over and begins kissing me. It\\u2019s intoxicating. We make love in a clearing. Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There\\u2019s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I\\u2019m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there\\u2019s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I\\u2019ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I\\u2019ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend. My friend is at a bar and I tell them what\\u2019s going on. I laugh. Then I\\u2019m suddenly at the bar, outside. I can see stuffed animal penguins in the grass - one on its side and one on its feet, walking towards the water. There\\u2019s another moment with Tad - beautiful and romantic coming together that I wish I could remember better.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a retreat - a weekend getaway with my husband and son. We\\u2019ve rented a house. I\\u2019m upstairs in the bathroom. My son is with me in the bathroom sitting at a table. I\\u2019m going to the bathroom, then realizing that my husband\\u2019s brother is there with me. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. I walk out without flushing the toilet. I also take off my shirt, but am again surprised that it\\u2019s not my husband who\\u2019s with me, but his brother. Then my husband comes home and goes up to the bathroom. He had been out. He looks into the toilet and is upset. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. Now I\\u2019m in an office building or a house - not mine or one I recognize. My friend is sitting on the kitchen counter. She looks at me as if she wants something from me. She wants to show me a picture she made. There is a window and a butterfly bush outside the window. Butterflies are flying around. My husband is standing there at the window and tells me how much he enjoys getting away for the weekend.\"],[\"At the last minute, Burning Man is happening this year. It\\u2019s very low key, but still in the desert. You just arrive and buy tickets at $15/person. You can also purchase rooms for $10/night. I go with my husband. We park the car on the side of the road, then walk through rusted out picked apart cars and airplanes with a bunch of white men smoking and drinking beer. We see our friends Diane and Warren in line. Diane offers to buy our tickets. I think it\\u2019s so nice of her. I then wonder what we\\u2019re going to do about our sleeping situation. We didn\\u2019t bring sleeping pads or blankets, so we\\u2019ll be sleeping in the car through the cold night and just throwing clothes over us. Now I think we might be able to afford a night or so in the hotel because Diane bought our tickets. We are walking through the festival. It\\u2019s more like a regular festival with vendors rather than Burning Man\\u2019s creative form of energy exchange and generous artistic sharing. As we continue to walk, we end up on a concrete street with hotels and office buildings. My husband looks up into a window and it\\u2019s cracked by a bullet hole. There is blood splattered all over the window. We don\\u2019t know if it just happened or if it\\u2019s been there a long time. We also don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an artistic expression of some kind. We don\\u2019t know if or how or where to report it and we keep on walking. But I have a feeling someone is dead in the hotel bathtub up there. Diane looks at a building on our side of the street. She exclaims about the black and green obsidian architectural accents on the building and around the windows. She thinks it would be wonderful to live in such a place because of the protection afforded by this stone. I think it\\u2019s beautiful, too. I like the idea of living in a place like that. We keep on walking. Then we are at the exit point of the festival where we get food to go and catch a bus to go back to our car. We\\u2019ve done this a couple days already and have our favorite dishes. I have been picking up a noodle bowl with a friend of mine (who I don\\u2019t know from waking life). We\\u2019re either really early or really late. The guy who makes our noodle bowl sees us and he secretly makes our food. But he can\\u2019t give it to us yet. So I go to the front and my friend stays and waits for our food. I\\u2019m waiting for him. The food is delivered to him, but then he never returns to me. It is revealed to me that he was trying to find me, but he stepped out into the road and was run over and killed by a car. All that\\u2019s left of him is a small clump or rat hair and crushed rat bones in the gutter. I\\u2019m concerned but not very upset. It seems more strange than awful. Then my stomach is not feeling up to eating, but I know I need to eat. I stand in line at a deli counter and ask if they serve hot sandwiches. They hand me a menu and I\\u2019m also trying to squint at and read the menu on the wall. I can\\u2019t read either, but they tell me they don\\u2019t make hot sandwiches for dinner but not now, so I go on. I go to the back where there is a bakery. I stand at the counter and no one else is there. The baker and owner of the bakery comes out from the back. He loves everything about baking. He\\u2019s telling me about all the ethnic baking styles he does. I say I want something warm and hot. He asks me what I like. I say I like hot. He asks me what kind of hot and I say \\u201cspicy.\\u201d He asks me what kind of spicy and I say \\u201cwarm spicy.\\u201d I\\u2019m not giving him a clear idea of what I like. He shows me a tray of baked goods and invites me to try it. I love it. I\\u2019m sitting on the side nibbling on this savory dish. Then a big group of people arrives and they start looking at all the sweet dishes. One person comes and sits next to me and eats their dish. I go up to the front and see they have a tray of sugar glazed sticky buns in the shape of mice. They tell me these are covered with raspberry sauce and filled with blueberry cream. So I take one and they ring me up at the register. They tell me it\\u2019s $12. I\\u2019m surprised that one pastry would cost so much. I tell them I already paid for the savory treat. They don\\u2019t really believe me, but then the owner comes out and tells them I did pay, so I only owe a few bucks. I feel nourished and I feel good about this exchange.\"],[\"I am teaching a yoga class. I\\u2019m subbing for my friend. It\\u2019s like I just pop up out of bed and there I am in the yoga studio. So I\\u2019m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it\\u2019s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don\\u2019t know who they are or where we are or what I\\u2019m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it\\u2019s just so odd. So I\\u2019m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren\\u2019t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I\\u2019m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can\\u2019t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it\\u2019s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn\\u2019t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It\\u2019s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I\\u2019m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can\\u2019t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I\\u2019ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark and crowded. I\\u2019m running away and trying to escape before Ursula finds me. She\\u2019s looking for me in the crowds. I can tell she wants to harm me. There is a conference and gathering of people dressed in futuristic clothes, all in black with coats. Somebody lets me borrow their big puffy black coat to help hide me. I put this on. There is a row of people who tell me I can blend in with their group. I think it will be a solution to sit in that row with them. Before the conference starts, I go to the bathroom. Ursula and Gemma walk in right behind me. They don\\u2019t see me and I slip into a stall. But Ursula steps into the stall next to me, to my right. Gemma continues to wait in line and I don\\u2019t know how to escape without her seeing me. I think I wait until they both use the other stall because there are only two stalls. I think it\\u2019s safe so I go out, but they are washing their hands. Gemma sees me, though. I join the row of people who told me I could hide with them, but Ursula spots me. I escape the conference center in my big puffy black coat. I go down the street to a small house where I see a boy digging in the dirt with a shovel and pale. His mom is standing on the porch. She offers to help hide me.\"],[\"There were a lot of parts to this dream and it felt like a big dream, but I only remember a small part. There is a house up on a mountain road where four people need to gather - two men and two women. The two men have arrived and one woman just arrived. I might be that woman. We are waiting for the fourth. She\\u2019s been given directions to find the house - just drive up this mountain road. As we are watching and waiting, we see a car pass by. It\\u2019s her. She keeps going up the road and misses the house. We are concerned and wonder how far she\\u2019ll drive before she realizes her mistake and comes back down.\"],[\"I am replaying in my dream over and over what I can\\u2019t decide is a memory from waking life or not. The so-called memory is a decision to do a dream experiment with Pema of remote viewing where we both decide on an image or visiting each other in the dream world, then coming back together to compare notes. I\\u2019m playing the scene over and over again as a loop to see if it actually happened in waking life. Then there are checkpoints, sometimes I\\u2019m walking, sometimes I\\u2019m in the backseat of a car, and sometimes I\\u2019m on the back of a motorcycle. I\\u2019m going through these checkpoints where we are searched and allowed to pass through or are held for more thorough searching. At one checkpoint that looks like airport security, bags are being passed through a scanner. There is a big bag of ceremonial cacao powder going through the scanning machine. For some reason, they need me to look at it and claim it as my own, placing a paper on it to show that it is mine. I wasn\\u2019t carrying it with me. It was a delivery to me. I So I agree. I think I\\u2019ll take it with me right away. They tell me I have to leave it for two weeks and come back to get it. At another point, I climb onto the back of a motorcycle that already has two people on it. I\\u2019m holding an egg that is cracking. It\\u2019s precious to be holding the egg at this moment of time, but it\\u2019s also making me feel somewhat uneasy because I think the mother should be watching over the egg. The motorcycle is speeding down the highway. I show the egg to the person sitting in front of me. I pass the cracking egg into their hand. The inner transparent membranous layer is now showing and I can see the animal underneath trying to make its way out. The egg cracks open entirely and the animal emerges. It is a little slimy cute bird-rat. It has wings and a long tail that extends up the animal\\u2019s back like an external spine. It looks like a dinosaur or maybe a dragon. We are holding the animal with care as the motorcycle continues to speed on.\"],[\"There is an operation with water dams - underground controlled waters. One of the dams breaks and the water is flooding. Tons of people are getting caught in the rushing water at the dam. Some are being washed away - children and adults of all ages. I can see them caught under the water. I\\u2019m among the people trying to fix it. Some of us are sitting at the dam, dropping things into the water. Others are trying to pull up and move metal fixtures and objects to stop the water from rushing. One woman at a control panel sees what\\u2019s going on. She strips her shirt off and runs into the water and swims up against the current to try and stop the flow. In another scene, I\\u2019m in my backyard. My neighbors are all walking around the grass. The fence has been broken and they\\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the pieces around to make a solid fence and container for the lawn again. In another scene, I\\u2019m walking up a hill to a mountain village with my son. We are following somebody. We hear a train in the distance. People are trying to stop the train. We are looking for our car. In another scene, we\\u2019ve been given a golden retriever puppy. It\\u2019s nighttime, but we don\\u2019t have a cage for the dog, so we go to a grocery outlet. They are closing up. But we need a dog cage. We end up buying other items. There is one item that goes through and I decide I don\\u2019t want it. We ask if we can return it and they say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s too late. We\\u2019re already past closing.\\u201d So we just decide to take it and come back to return it. Outside there are Latino men with blanket rolls setting up to sleep on the sidewalk for the night. Each of them also has what looks like a wolf head. When I look closely, it\\u2019s an entire white wolf pelt. They each killed their own wolf and made a protective cover for themselves to keep out the cold at night.\"],[\"I go to an address to find a new dress for Trina, my former boss. I\\u2019ve never been here before. When I walk in, my jaw drops in amazement. It\\u2019s a huge barn that has been converted into a boutique with gorgeous gowns hanging up on the walls all the way up to the ceiling. I\\u2019m looking for a particular style because the other dress was torn. It\\u2019s like an art gallery. I find a similar dress but with more vibrant colors. I ask for help getting it down. The woman who works here is thin and old with dry wrinkled skin. Her eyes are very bright and alive. She seems to know something I don\\u2019t know yet. Then she tells me that they have a dream group that meets here every other Tuesday. The man who leads this dream group is so eccentric and people really love him and adore him. I\\u2019m a little interested but also wary and doubtful of a man with such charisma and appeal. Then I\\u2019m walking down a hall in this big barn which I now realize is a retreat center. I see a sandwich board with an announcement for this dream workshop which happens to be this day later this evening. I then encounter this beautiful man in the hallway and there is something so magnetizing between the two of us. We are immediately drawn together and he\\u2019s pressing me against the wall. We are having an ecstatic sexual encounter, even though I\\u2019ve never seen him before. Then we smoothe down our clothes and go our individual ways. The old woman from the art dress show has arranged for me to have dinner with this dream teacher. So I go and am surprised to see the elegant dining room within the barn. I\\u2019m sitting at a table by myself. I order some food and this woman comes by. I\\u2019m loving my food - bread with oil for dipping. The woman pulls the bread out of my hand and starts to eat. I\\u2019m fighting her for it and think it\\u2019s so beyond that she\\u2019s decided to come up and eat my food! We\\u2019re having a fight about it and she just doesn\\u2019t understand. She wants to sue me not letting her eat my own food. Then the dream teacher\\u2019s assistant sits at the other side - I don\\u2019t know if they are a man or woman. The man from the hallway comes and sits directly across from me and gives me this smile. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that man in the hallway was this dream teacher.\\u201d I feel a bit awkward and don\\u2019t know what to say. He\\u2019s smiling at me in a knowing kind of laughing way and is enjoying my little shock. He introduces himself as if meeting me for the first time. I play along. His assistant kind of knows what\\u2019s going on. They order the food for the whole table and seem to know the menu well. The food arrives - noodles, lobster, buttery decadent amazing melt in your mouth meal with the most exquisite wine. My senses are turned on to full ecstasy. We begin talking about dreams. I end up going to the dream group and I can feel why people love him. My whole self is turned on again. I go every week. It seems like every other week we have this amazing sexual experience together and the other weeks he\\u2019s just focused on teaching and being there for all the students. I accept that this is the education and experience. Our relationship is amazing. There are no emotional obligations or expectations. Each class, the chairs are adjusted. In the last part of the dream, I remember a woman sitting in front of me. She\\u2019s a younger woman and hasn\\u2019t had any children, so her body hasn\\u2019t been stretched and it\\u2019s still in a bouncy young shape. She\\u2019s wearing a teeny tiny zebra print bikini bottoms. She\\u2019s leaning over in a provocative way then arching her back across the back of the chair revealing her beautiful sexy body and trying to catch his attention. I feel unhappy and insecure. My friend sitting next to me tells me, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it. He\\u2019s completely yours, through and through.\\u201d\"],[\"I am in the back of a building. There\\u2019s a man who really loves me. We\\u2019re wanting to be together, Then I am with this man and a group of priestesses building an altar. Gwen, Erin and Kem are there. Ursula is conspicuously not there. We put items on the altar, each of us contributing to different altars. The image that is most clear to me is a pile of tarot cards spread across the table, a picture of red shoes and an actual pair of red satin pointe shoes at the center of the altar.\"],[\"All I can remember is a mason jar with a smoothie in it and a transparent baby caterpillar climbing over the rim. I think it\\u2019s gross and wonder how many other bugs might be in the smoothie.\"],[\"There was so much to this dream but I\\u2019ve forgotten most of it. It felt important. People have made sand sculptures. Three people have made turtles. Two were too round. The third one is life-like. I see it with sand roses, then I see it lined with blue beer cans. Then I see it standing on its back fins on top of one of the other turtles. It is waving its fins in the air and saying: \\u201cThis is how a turtle is supposed to look. See how flat I am?\\u201d\"],[\"We\\u2019re visiting a female teacher, somewhat like a swami or guru, at her luxurious apartments in a city. She is of Indian descent. She is very alluring and has a lot of wealth and beauty and power. We\\u2019re at the dinner table. Fae is going through a process of some kind - she\\u2019s having a hard time and people are gathering to help her. The minister\\u2019s wife does some beautiful singing and healing with hands, whooshing away the worry, concern and pain. Then people gather closer to help, but Fae feels complete and most of the people go away. I stay. George is sitting at the table and speaking with Fae in the voice of our shadow work teacher. He\\u2019s helping her get clear on some things. He looks at me and talks with me in the same voice. Then we have to go. I have to go with my husband and we must leave quickly. I have a bag and am going down a hallway to an elevator. I get in the elevator, but my husband is still back in the apartments. I am trying to hold the elevator open. A guy comes. He\\u2019s leering at me. He has my husband\\u2019s backpack. I don\\u2019t want to be stuck in this elevator alone with him - I have a bad feeling about him. After a while of me insisting that we hold the door open, other people come. A mom is pushing her mentally/physically disabled child in a big plastic car. Other people come in and the elevator is full. My fingers slip and the doors close. The elevator goes down and when we get to the street level, everybody pours out. We\\u2019re on the streets of New York. there\\u2019s no way to get back up, except if we stand in a long line for the next elevator. I\\u2019m panicked because I\\u2019ve lost my husband\\u2019s backpack. The guy has moved on. I see that the backpack has been dropped. I check and see that everything is still in it. I guess I just have to wait for my husband to come down and hope he can find me. The city is so big and overwhelming. Then it\\u2019s later in the dream and I\\u2019m back in the luxury apartments. The teacher is preparing to go out for the evening. My husband wants to go and so do I. She says we can both come, but she has a glint in her eye. I remember my son is asleep upstairs and we both can\\u2019t go if no one stays to watch him. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what we can do. There are other people in the house - her male consort and other people that my son hasn\\u2019t met. I guess it will be okay. She takes me upstairs and looks at my shoes. I\\u2019m wearing red moccasins that are good walking shoes, but she scoffs at them - they\\u2019re quite ugly. Her shoes have a point at the end and are intricately beaded with lovely tassels. She tells me I need to change my shoes if I want to go out with them. Then she tells me she has a wife for my husband or maybe my brother (who I don\\u2019t have in waking life). I\\u2019m confused and concerned. She shows me a picture - a Christmas card - with a family. She points out a woman with a round face and kinky hair. There\\u2019s also a photo of her with her friend and her son floating in a jacuzzi. They\\u2019re holding a onesie over the baby. I\\u2019m wondering how much time I\\u2019ll have with my husband if he\\u2019s with her. It\\u2019s very confusing. I realize that she\\u2019s talking about someone else.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving along a beautiful lush coastline, maybe Oregon, maybe Ireland, maybe Hawaii. I\\u2019m going to a hotel with a small group of people for an educational high level training of some kind. I don\\u2019t recall who was there, except for Jeremy. Zoe is still alive, but she\\u2019s at their house and near her death. We arrive and are settling in. Somewhere around three o\\u2019clock, Jeremy gets a call from Zoe. She's distressed and feels very close to death. He, unusually, denies it and her because she\\u2019s been having similar experiences and it\\u2019s been more stressful and anxiety producing than real. So he hangs up the phone. I go into meditation. I see her in the courtyard outside their house - but it\\u2019s not their house in waking life. She\\u2019s dancing barefoot on the concrete ground. She gets really tired and turns off the music. She goes to the deck and lays her head down on the wooden deck and falls asleep for the last time. Somehow, we found out she has died. I know the exact moment because of my vision - it was in that three o\\u2019clock afternoon after, like 3:11pm. I gather my things to go with Jeremy over to the house. All the arrangements have been made by her friends. There are interactions in the hotel before we left, but I can\\u2019t recall them now. There\\u2019s a sense we will be spending the night together. We make the winding drive back along the coast to the house. When we arrive, her friends have laid her body out in the barn. Pema is there along with other friends who I\\u2019ve seen in passing. They\\u2019re preparing for the funeral or celebration of life. They\\u2019re slicing lemons in the kitchen and in the garden gathering flowers. They\\u2019re also gathering and writing poetry and preparing for guests. We go inside. People are sitting in rows. I sit by myself at the end of a row. I turn around and there are people looking at me. They are people from my past who I don\\u2019t remember as I\\u2019ve lived in many places and known many friends and forgotten many people. They share their memories of me and how they haven\\u2019t forgotten me. They\\u2019ve even waited for me to return, and I never did and I didn\\u2019t remember them. There is one man in particular who I\\u2019m drawn to - he\\u2019s a Pacific Islander, very robust and of the islands. I\\u2019m deeply attracted to him and wonder what is between us. I also see deep pockmarks on his face from cystic acne when he was younger. There\\u2019s a woman sitting next to him who also has scars on her face from acne. The people are so crowded and sitting close together. The ceremony is about to begin. I\\u2019m a little concerned that we could all catch the coronavirus if anybody had it. I begin to lift my collar over my face, but decide against it and instead intend to breathe in my own space. People are singing and saying poetry for Zoe. It\\u2019s a beautiful ceremony. Some time passes. Jeremy tells me that Zoe has been moved to the grey house and there will be a viewing. He invites me to go. I walk in and see people sitting at banquet tables. Immediately I see my grandmother and she\\u2019s sitting next to my grandfather. My uncles are with them and so are Aunt Frieda and Bertie (they are twins and my grandmother\\u2019s sisters) and other people who are family - perhaps my grandmother\\u2019s other siblings. I\\u2019m overjoyed to see her and it\\u2019s so real, except that everyone has an otherworldly shine and vitality that is a more than human vitality. I don\\u2019t ever talk to my grandmother. I hug my uncles who are both still alive in waking life. I go to the end of the row and connect with my great aunt.\"],[\"I arrive at an international train station. It\\u2019s been a long journey and I\\u2019m tired and hungry. I find an abandoned small purse like a wallet - it\\u2019s flat but full. I open it and see a lot of money, credit and bank cards. I take it and am not sure what to do with it. I don\\u2019t speak the language and the officials here seem untrustworthy. So I take it with me. I sit at a table with friends and I show it to them. Some time passes and we are waiting. Swamiji arrives and takes us to the center. We get settled in. Somebody needs some money. I give her the bank card and the whole purse to extract the money. I tell her to keep it because I don\\u2019t want it on me anymore. I\\u2019m sitting with Swamiji and he gives me a lesson of some kind. I tell him about the purse and money. He\\u2019s upset because the purse holds a U.S. passport and tracking devices, so anyone who has taken the money could be accused of theft and charged. I\\u2019m a bit worried for myself, too, because I took some cash earlier to buy some food for myself. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to replenish the cash and we are both trying to figure out where the woman has gone who took the purse. We don\\u2019t want to get involved with the authorities. Swamiji is very concerned.\"],[\"Multiple dreams seem to be occurring at the same time. One dream keeps looping like a mental thought. I have ideas about the sleep and dream database. I\\u2019m trying to make sure I remember them. I\\u2019m at a computer and wanting to find all the dreams by a certain participant and search by participant name. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to do this. I\\u2019m looking for that search function and trying to make sure my conscious mind remembers to ask Edward about this the next day.\"],[\"There\\u2019s an awkward dream with a former friend, Liz. It\\u2019s like Edward and I have given her an itemized receipt or invoice for her to review and pay. She\\u2019s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There\\u2019s another dream where we\\u2019re looking at a house. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull. In another dream scene, I go into a bakery through the side door where baking scientists are discussing plans for the day. I\\u2019m not sure whether to leave or stay and ask my question. I don\\u2019t feel particularly welcome in this food laboratory.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying at a big house. I\\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment with a woman who reminds me of Geri (a friend who worked for Burning Man and who I camped with a couple times) for 11am the next day. There are a lot of people here. I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It\\u2019s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn\\u2019t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I\\u2019m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She\\u2019s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can\\u2019t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I\\u2019m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I\\u2019m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren\\u2019t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day\\u2019s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I\\u2019m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I\\u2019m waiting at the couches - I\\u2019ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I\\u2019m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it\\u2019s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I\\u2019m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I\\u2019m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I\\u2019m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn\\u2019t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don\\u2019t want to do it anymore and I\\u2019m not going to come back. She says, \\u201cWell, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle. This is not something you give up so quickly.\\u201d I doubt myself and wonder if this is a good idea even though it doesn\\u2019t feel right or fitting. I agree to come back one more time to give it another chance.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a little town, in and out of small groups of people. We\\u2019re told it\\u2019s going to rain tonight, so we\\u2019re coming up with a plan of whether to stay or go. Some of the people live here and others of us are just visiting. A couple of my patients (lesbian women partners) have a room here and they also have a roommate. They show me their apartment and it\\u2019s quite interesting. We walk in through the door and the king sized bed is right there. There\\u2019s a kitchen and laundry room off to the side and an additional bedroom for the roommate to the right behind a curtain. The roommate comes and they show me around. Somehow I know that Liam is there. I have a flash of having seen him earlier in the morning. Now it\\u2019s getting towards evening. I am with another person - sometimes the person is a woman and sometimes the person is a man. We meet up with Liam in the hallway of the hotel. He wants to take us to his rooms and show us where he\\u2019s been staying. It\\u2019s not so easy to get to his rooms. He takes us down the hallway, down a back set of stairs, and across another hallway. We\\u2019re on the floor just below the ground where the windows are just above the ground. We come to his rooms, but we can\\u2019t enter from the hallway. So we have to go through the brothers\\u2019 room next door. This room is where five men are staying. He knocks on the door and we walk through. The men are all hanging around on couches watching a show, probably a sports show. One man has a girlfriend and she\\u2019s watching me as if I don\\u2019t belong. We pass through a door and down a short hallway to Liam\\u2019s room. He opens the door and there\\u2019s a naked woman wrapped up in a white sheet as if she\\u2019s just been ravished in the morning and sleeping all day. At first I think it\\u2019s his wife and am thinking I should leave. But then she rolls over. She\\u2019s a very tiny Asian woman. I guess they\\u2019ve been practicing tantric sex secrets and she has a book. There\\u2019s an invitation for all of us to be together. She instructs us. We all look at each other. Liam and I lock eyes and nod. He leans towards the man first as if inviting him in, but then the magnetism between us is too strong and he leans into me. We feel so good together, rolling around the bed. I want to stay in his embrace. It feels so right and natural. I want to remember this feeling.\"],[\"This is the last part of the dream: I\\u2019m with a group of people in a tropical place. There\\u2019s red dirt like Hawaii, or maybe Costa Rica. My husband along with a couple (our friends and both yoga teachers), and a few others. We\\u2019ve been looking at houses. We come to this piece of land. Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We\\u2019re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they\\u2019re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They\\u2019re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we\\u2019re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings. I see people making the paper boats with bits of paper they found in the trash. There\\u2019s also some kind of healing going on.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at an airport. I\\u2019m sitting at a table playing a card or domino game with my grandmother and Ted. There is definitely a strong desire and attraction between Ted and me. We want to find a place and time after the game to be together. My grandmother is watching without judgment. She knows. There\\u2019s absolutely no judgment from her, but for me I feel a combination of comfort with her and a strong charge of desire and comfort in playing with him, especially when our hands occasionally touch. I have a wallet. I need to pay for something - my portion of a rent or dues as part of a big group. I take my wallet out to pay. Somehow my husband now has my wallet and takes care of the payment for me. My grandmother goes on to catch her plane. Ted and I walk together through a crowd, but not wanting to attract any attention because he is well respected in this group as am I - we are both known. Now I\\u2019m looking for a new carry-on suitcase. There are stores all over. I have an argument with my husband about which one to get and it\\u2019s so frustrating. I see a store with some beautiful floral suitcases on the loft. I\\u2019m told that this shopkeeper knows exactly what I need. I consult with her and choose one. I panic when I try to pay and can\\u2019t find my wallet. Ted goes to look for it. Then I remember that my husband has it. He scoffs at me and says the wallet is in the jacket, or at least that\\u2019s where he put it and last saw it. I\\u2019m frustrated because I don\\u2019t trust that he put it in the jacket in a secure way. I\\u2019m also concerned he just left it somewhere. Then I come upon a huge underground room - it\\u2019s like an underground sea with big pillars holding up the roof. It\\u2019s dark. I see wading in the shallow water, a figure like Merlin in a cape and holding a staff. I wade into the water to see him. I\\u2019m still thinking of and desiring Ted. I look up and see people coming across the bridge. They are carrying my coat. They give the coat to me. I feel through it and cannot find my wallet. It\\u2019s the wrong coat and my wallet is not there. I\\u2019m shaking it and feeling all over. People walk into the water then walk out. I\\u2019m not sure if they have my highest interest in mind. They are communicating with the magician. I leave. I do find the correct jacket with the wallet in the pocket.\"],[\"\\u201cMass Inoculations\\u201d I\\u2019m at Whole Foods. There\\u2019s an announcement that all customers must line up immediately at the front of the store. The doors are locked so no one can leave. A nurse is sitting at a desk and we line up in front of her. I\\u2019m about in the middle of the line. The nurse is spraying a vaccine mist for SARS-CoV-2 in front of each person\\u2019s nose and requiring them to sniff deeply to bring it in. She does not explain what it is or how it works. I comply the first time because it does not seem too harmful for my body, but I try not to breathe it in deeply. But the next time around, she takes out a long thin needle connected to a vat of the vaccine. When it\\u2019s my turn, I say no. I am firm but non-violent in my resistance. She has been prepared for this scenario. So instead of poking me with the needle, she pushes a stronger dose of the nasal mist up into my nostrils. I can\\u2019t breathe through my right nostril at first, but she continues to be steady and persistent in her administration of the proper dose. I do eventually take it in. i am allowed to go home. I stop at a doctor\\u2019s office for some reason. I see another mother from town. There\\u2019s some kind of dance with distancing and gauging whether it\\u2019s okay now to be near each other, talk or communicate in any way. I go home, but it\\u2019s not really my home. I\\u2019m in a room on the third floor. People are gathered downstairs in the courtyard, drinking and eating. I stand at the window watching. A foreign man sees me. He saw me at the doctor\\u2019s office, too, and was attracted to me. I\\u2019m not sure whether to be afraid of him or not. I step back from the window, stand naked at the end of the bed and fall backwards. Somehow he sees me do this through the window. I stay in my room lying on my back, scanning my body for any harmful effects from the spray. I want my husband to come home soon. He does, but only briefly. He has to go somewhere. I offer to drive him because I don\\u2019t want to be left alone in case something bad happens to me.\"],[\"I wake up from a nightmare screaming for the police.\"],[\"A woman in a striped pant jumpsuit is being interviewed about her upcoming wedding. The night before she had a party with her bridesmaids. They were wearing their wedding clothes and now they\\u2019re dirty and need to be laundered for the ceremony.\"],[\"A dinner event. A wild animal runs through, injured. I chase after this animal. There are other wild animals running with me. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll blend in with them and they will not notice I\\u2019m human, but animal like them. We\\u2019ll run together and catch up with the injured one ahead. A man who runs with these animals has joined us and is running just behind me down the path. One of the animals falls but is able to get up and continue. Scene change. A group of people gather on a rooftop. They are making a temporary home each night on this roof, setting up tents, cooking food. A man who used to live in his van at the river is there. He now has a truck and it doesn\\u2019t appear that he lives in the truck, so I think he\\u2019s bought a house. But he is traveling with us. Every night we set everything up then take everything down in the morning. We go on a journey during the day, taking the truck. We pull out all our kitchen and sleeping supplies at night. One night, a woman takes out a fancy grill - so much nicer and easier to use than the one we\\u2019ve been using because there is no need to hook up propane. You just push a button for the heat and another button for the water. I feel a little ashamed of my smaller one, but realize mine serves a purpose because it is smaller and more easily transported.\"],[\"A man gets out of a bad limousine. Inside are two car seats for twins.\"],[\"I find out from Gail that the ladies didn\\u2019t really want to start meeting again with me. But they were humoring me. It feels really uncomfortable. I find this out while sitting with Gail at a small particle board table that has been painted and carved to look nicer. Gail\\u2019s oldest daughter is picking at the table and ruining it. Gai\\u2019s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She\\u2019s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks. She looks so beautiful and I\\u2019m envious, but know I couldn\\u2019t wear either of those outfits because I\\u2019m not tall and thin. Irene is going to meet her lover. Then she ends up going to the second story. Katy is there and they are having a wonderful deep engaging conversation. Again, I\\u2019m feeling left out as if I don\\u2019t belong and have nothing of value to contribute. On a floor above is a barber shop. My dad is getting his hair cut. My mom is there, too. Then somehow this barber shop is in another building - a hospital. Ted tells me he\\u2019s been enjoying talking to and seeing my parents on the floor just above where he works. I\\u2019m happy to see Ted and talk with him. My mom and I then go out to dinner. We\\u2019re sitting in a dark restaurant and a man is sitting with us. He feels a bit creepy. The waiter comes by and has a thick Irish accent. I order fries and then my mom orders. Then the waiter and the man start talking with each other in Gaelic. I\\u2019m wanting to interrupt so I can speak and learn the language again. The guy at my table is reading a poem. I ask if the word means garter as I make a motion of pulling a garter up over my leg. They look at me and laugh as if humoring me. They are laughing as if it was some sort of sexual innuendo that I didn\\u2019t catch. The waiter disappears and doesn\\u2019t return to our table. He has to declare bankruptcy but is being hunted down for money he owes. I find him in a crowded cafe with multiple serving stations. He\\u2019s making eggs with parmesan cheese to serve and judged. If he gets the cooking job, he\\u2019ll be able to pay his bills. I join him at the stove and help plate the eggs. I see a pile of powdered sugar on the plate, but think it should be on the dessert plate instead. His girlfriend is also helping. I scoop up the powdered sugar but don\\u2019t have a place for it while she plops savory sauce on the plate. It\\u2019s messy but it tastes good. I think it tastes so good that the appearance won\\u2019t matter.\"],[\"A really sinister feeling deram. I\\u2019m at a retreat center. The lodging is more like a dormitory, almost like Esalen with multiple bunk beds in each room. All the rooms are lined up in one long building. There\\u2019s a priest figure who\\u2019s either leading the retreat is a guru for this retreat center community. He\\u2019s a combination of different energies, including Swamiji. There are quite a few people gathered, some remind me of people from high school and others from college. There\\u2019s also my husband and me. My husband is upset and distant from me. He\\u2019s talking with other circles of people. I go into my room that I share with a group of people. I am witness to a murder and brainwashing. I\\u2019m not entirely brainwashed though, so I see it for what it is. It\\u2019s really disturbing. The priest is there. His assistant is with him. I feel sick to my stomach and don\\u2019t want to remember what I saw. They manipulate this young man, making him into a zombie-like state, then kiss all the life out of him. The people continue to do their things - folding clothes, brushing teeth, getting dressed. I hear the priest and his assistant talking about what to do with the body. The assistant says, \\u201cThis may have to be the last one for awhile because there might be some questions about the accident.\\u201d They plan to frame his death as a fall down the cliffs. I try to behave like the others to get away. I have a sense they\\u2019ve picked up on my more aware and attentive consciousness. I\\u2019m desperately looking for my husband to tell him because he\\u2019s one of the only ones I feel I can confide in now. I see him sitting on a bench with a small group of people. I want to draw him away so I can speak with him, but he doesn\\u2019t want to leave this group. He may somehow be involved with the deception somehow. The scene shifts. It seems like a month or so has passed. The same people are here. But now they are circulating around higher society at a symphony gala. They\\u2019re still doing the same sinister plotting and killing. Somehow they end up in the same location as me. I cross paths with them in the kitchen. More time has passed or maybe this is before. I\\u2019m going to a little library for a book reading and meditation. It\\u2019s in a neat geodesic dome. There\\u2019s an attic area upstairs with a woman who deceived my husband. The library has a collection of rare spiritual and magical books - not what you\\u2019d normally find in a library. This has been built as someone\\u2019s home and then later turned into a place for the public. I\\u2019m meeting with a small group of women. We\\u2019re sitting on the couch waiting for somebody. I recognize them from waking life, but they are distinctly different from their waking life appearance - shorter hair, heavier, odd voice, strange style of dress. They decide to begin. Usually I\\u2019m the one to begin, but Beth and Sherry begin instead. Beth takes out a long curved brown dried leaf with an incense stick and a white piece of copal. But then Shnati smiles and pops the copal in her mouth like a piece of candy. They light the incense and begin. Somebody sings a song. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m setting up a beach blanket with my mom, sister and son. It\\u2019s a lovely day. I\\u2019m watching a young Indian mother and her child play in the water. She\\u2019s round and full in her body, so is he. They go out into the waves during a lull. Others are swimming in the water. Then suddenly a big wave rises up out of the ocean. The wave swallows the mother and son, then it rushes up to our towel. It washes my Kindle away along with my bags, shoes and son. I\\u2019m scrambling waiting for the waves to calm so I can find everything and hoping the water returns it all. My son is okay. My Kindle is buried partially under the sand, still in its case. It\\u2019s okay. We move our towels up where there is a young gay couple on their towel. We\\u2019re close to them, but we will all move soon and have more space between us.\"],[\"An old building made of stone with old fixtures. It\\u2019s two maybe three stories with big wide stairs. I\\u2019m walking up to the second floor. There\\u2019s something about water, learning about the power and magic of water. There\\u2019s a feeling of conflict, misunderstanding, fear, manipulation, and yet an attempt at forming a common goal - a goal of learning then teaching. The power goes out in the building. Then, we\\u2019re in the hallway sweeping up dirt and hair that has fallen off people\\u2019s heads over the years. In another room, a class is beginning. Someone hands me an amulet of lava stone with red jewels and hammered iron. I wear it during the class. The class is a movement almost like yoga. I wear the amulet to charge it with power. I\\u2019m given two other amulets to wear and keep with me and charge up as well.\"],[\"I am touring a large apartment building. Units are being made available as people move. Some are moving out completely, others are moving for a better view. When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I\\u2019m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we\\u2019ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That\\u2019s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I\\u2019d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There\\u2019s a sign about reservations required. It\\u2019s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It\\u2019s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I\\u2019m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don\\u2019t want to pay because there\\u2019s only fifteen minutes left. I\\u2019m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn\\u2019t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we\\u2019re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It\\u2019s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I\\u2019m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there\\u2019s no place for me to sit. I\\u2019m watching my son to see if he\\u2019s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t find my husband. I\\u2019m at some kind of party at a country club or public pool. First I get a video call from my mom and sister. She\\u2019s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She\\u2019s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I\\u2019m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I\\u2019m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he\\u2019s actually swimming. He\\u2019s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I\\u2019m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can\\u2019t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I\\u2019m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he\\u2019s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I\\u2019m so mad at him. And he\\u2019s just shrugging me off. He tells me that he\\u2019s been doing other stuff, too, and not telling me about it: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been drinking six cups of coffee a day, drinking beer everyday, getting high everyday and smoking cigarettes again. I\\u2019ve been hiding from you the whole time because I know how upset you get.\\u201d I\\u2019m so mad that I want to beat him up. The woman comes back. She\\u2019s watching and smoking. She has tattoos all over her body and they aren\\u2019t well done or tastefully designed. She lifts up her shirt to show her belly. I can see she is very far along. The baby is lying sideways which isn\\u2019t good. I\\u2019m continuing to get more mad. She asks him where to send the invoice for the cigarettes. He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It\\u2019s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It\\u2019s \\u201cWhyNotHard\\u201d or \\u201cWhyNot&Hard\\u201d or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. I\\u2019m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he\\u2019s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we\\u2019re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together. One of them starts to sing and tells me she\\u2019s been watching and listening to the whole drama. She\\u2019s laughing because she\\u2019s been there before. They are all singing a song and the scene shifts. It\\u2019s like we are in a music video. We are standing under trees by a body of water. There are brown leaves covering the ground. I see an ice blue woman naked and lying partially hidden under the leaves. I wonder if she is me. I can\\u2019t recall what happens next. But then I am trying to teach a yoga class to a group of people who are wanting really advanced trick poses. I can do and teach these poses but I want to slowly warm them up and prepare them to do it safely. But, nobody is really paying attention. They have this better than thou attitude that turns me off. I don't want to continue teaching to people who are so disrespectful.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at Edward\\u2019s house on a river or a lake. There\\u2019s a gathering. People are arriving for a retreat. I\\u2019m organizing it and getting people situated in their rooms. I\\u2019m giving people the schedule for the weekend and providing bodywork during the down times. I\\u2019m filling the schedule up between the meeting times with activities. My first person is Deanne. She is wearing a scarf with Egyptian eye symbols. It\\u2019s making shadows of eyes on her cheeks and one over her brow. I remark on it and ask her about it. She shows me the scarf and how these symbols are made of metal and appliqued onto the ends of the scarf. She lies down on a table in a cold stone room. She enjoys it. My next person arrives - another yoga teacher. I\\u2019m a bit distracted while massaging her. I go upstairs and see Deanne and others on the third story getting chairs. I check in with Edward and see he\\u2019s with his family moving about and getting organized. I go back inside to the stone tower and see Deanne is receiving an oil treatment on her face. I go down the stairs to where I was working with the other woman. Someone else is with her giving her a cranial session. I look at the clock and see that I left early and didn\\u2019t give her enough time. I have already put the table away, but have her lie down on the stone floor. She pulls out a mat that people wipe their feet on and lies on it. I do some contacts on her head to complete the session. Then I walk outside for the gathering. It smells so good because flowers are blooming and the garden is thriving with vegetables and herbs. He asks If I know what kind of greens people most enjoy growing in Oregon at this time of year. I don\\u2019t know. He says, \\u201cCoconut arugula.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s interesting and haven\\u2019t heard of such a thing. But then someone laughs and says we don\\u2019t have greens in Oregon at this time of year. I see that people have set up their chairs in a circle by the garden and next to the water. A sidewalk goes right through the center of the circle and no one is sitting on the cement, so I do. I sit next to Edward on the ground. Everyone is sitting on chairs. Others arrive late and they are bringing pillars of stone to lean on. They\\u2019re boisterous and talking amongst themselves. Edward stands up and moves people around so that the people who were talking are no longer standing next to each other. He moves the chairs and pillars, too. The reorganization is a bit unsettling to the people who arrived early, but it seems to be the best approach and satisfies the lady of the house who is overseeing it all.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house or residential school. I\\u2019m taking my examinations - writing, math and dance. Eac person has their own private space to write. I go outside to the yard with my blue books and find a stone grotto to sit in. it\\u2019s dark outside, night. After I finish writing, I go back inside for the dance examination. This is a small performance based audition. I enter into the audition late and displace another woman who was until now guaranteed a spot in the school. Afterward, people begin talking about my skill and wondering where I learned to dance like that. I walk into another room where they keep the wild leopards. There is a pool with rocks along the side and some trees - an attempt to replicate a watering hole in their natural environment. I see a huge one - a paleolithic version of the leopard. This one is standing on a rock in the water. A younger adolescent leopard is lying splayed out on the beach, mouth open wide and teeth showing - it reminds me of a skinned lion rug I\\u2019ve seen before in waking life. There\\u2019s also a paleolithic leopard kitten crawling around the rocks. I'm surprised to see these wild animals inside a concrete room without windows. I go to another room that is a workroom with tools, like a woodwork or metal shop.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m downtown in an urban environment that I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It\\u2019s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There\\u2019s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I\\u2019m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn\\u2019t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it\\u2019s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn\\u2019t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren\\u2019t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a car. We are driving down a slippery wet road at night. My son is in the backseat with a man. My husband is driving and I\\u2019m in the passenger seat. We\\u2019re leaving the house for an errand. A family has moved into our apartment with us and has brought all their kitchen supplies including a large cast iron pan, a whole collection of knives, spatulas, spoons and other things. Before we left, I was making an egg on a pan with a non-stick surface. Whenever I stepped out of the kitchen, the mom came and moved my egg to the cast iron. I moved it back and she moved it again. It was really irritating and I wanted them out. I couldn\\u2019t imagine blending our households. So I left. We are dropping off her husband so he can pick up more things. He\\u2019s aware of her controlling ways in the household and especially in the kitchen. He\\u2019s silent and apologetic in his silence. We drop him off at a house in another neighborhood. Then my husband drops me off at a gym for a class. Other women are sitting on the street waiting for them to open. I lean my chiropractic table against a garage door. Behind the garage door are supplies for the dance and exercise classes. I can see numbers that tally the equipment to help keep track of it all when people use them for classes and return them later. A woman comes to sit beside me. She recognizes me and offers me a drink from her flask. I take it then the teacher comes and opens the doors. We all go inside and are all tipsy. The class begins but it is disorganized. It\\u2019s kind of like an adult gymnastics class and it feels like a gym I used to go to when I was younger - balance beams, parallel bars, tumbling floor and vault. A woman who identifies herself as Tiffany (I don\\u2019t know her from waking life) invites me to her family\\u2019s home after class. I go with her. Her aunt is sitting in the backseat and we are going to visit her mom, Norma.\"],[\"A line of four airport seats set up against the back of four other seats, the fake leather with metal bars between and the sling hammock kind of seat. Airport televisions up all around. There is a viewing of an independent film. The people showing it have made a big vat of spaghetti and meat sauce to share. People haven\\u2019t come to see the film, so there\\u2019s a huge excess of spaghetti and sauce spilling out of the containers and onto the seats and onto the floor. Another scene, arriving at a house on a hill that was just purchased by a lesbian couple. She opens a glass door to a courtyard with a beautiful view across the valley to the mountains. A storm is coming. We rush inside the house. It\\u2019s a small but cute house. I\\u2019m trying to close the french doors closed against the wind and rain. One set of doors close well. But I\\u2019m fighting against hurricane force wind to close the other set of doors. My dad appears and forcibly pulls the doors together and down. They shut, but they are torn from the top. The other woman partner comes by and is upset by the damage, but she\\u2019ll fix it once the storm passes.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a movie theater. It\\u2019s dark and grungy. People are scattered about and sitting in small clusters. The film begins but people are not interested. I\\u2019m drawn to looking at a screen of zoom video squares of the people in the theater - it\\u2019s like each group is being watched by unseen cameras. One woman has her head between her knees. She is vomiting on the floor. A man is sitting next to her, patting and rubbing her back. It\\u2019s not clear whether they\\u2019re together. It seems she is suffering from drugs in her system - she took too much and is beyond high. Other people are sleeping. Others are drunk. Others are in some kind of recovery program and barely holding it together. Some are relaxing. I, or somebody, is looking for a person to participate in a study. Their system needs to be pure and clear. Their mind needs to be clear. As I\\u2019m looking around, I see that even the people who aren\\u2019t high, drunk or stoned are in despair, and that won\\u2019t do.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a conference center. I\\u2019ve happened upon a group of people. They all look like they work with nature conservation in some way - forestry, seed saving, permaculture, climate change, soil, etc. I\\u2019m really interested in what\\u2019s happening here. I just sort of add myself to the group. This is the first day of their meeting. Everyone circles up and they all have name tags except me. The guide notices I don\\u2019t have a name tag and she asks if I registered for the day. I tell her no and I didn\\u2019t know about this until I just happened upon it, but I feel like I really need to be here. She stops for a bit and thinks about what I\\u2019ve said then says, \\u201cOkay, come with me.\\u201d Everyone breaks for gathering their things and getting ready for the day of being on the land and learning about the seeds, roots, berries, flowers and their conservation as well as their medicinal uses. I\\u2019m walking with the guide. She is a young woman with long blond hair. She has grown up in relationship with the land. We are at Esalen - my dream form of Esalen. We need to get permission from the front office so that I can be here, even though I\\u2019m not planning to stay overnight. They still need to register me for the course. We\\u2019re looking, but can\\u2019t find anyone with authority. We stop at her trailer so she can get a certificate and papers for me. The trailer is really interesting. I recognize it as somewhere I\\u2019ve been before, even though I haven\\u2019t in waking life. The trailer is reserved for visiting faculty. Before the closets were full of Burning Man style costume clothes that the teachers could wear around the campus. Another wall is lined with narrow shelves filled with small cylindrical bottles of herbs of all colors. There\\u2019s another set of wider shelves in the corner by the bed with books. It\\u2019s a sweet and comfortable place. I notice that the clothes have been traded out for doll-sized clothes, so it\\u2019s more for decoration than use. It\\u2019s a new COVID policy shift, so it still has the old flavor of how things used to be, but now the clothes can\\u2019t actually be worn. She gets what she needs and fills her bag for the day of teaching on the land. We leave. We pass through a dining area. They are just now putting out lunch. She suggests we stay for lunch. It\\u2019s a spread of delicious mini sliders - hamburgers and hot dogs with gourmet toppings, and caprese vegetarian ones. It all looks so beautiful and delicious. I surreptitiously reach for one and eat it, trying to look like I\\u2019m not actually chewing because I\\u2019m not registered and I\\u2019m not really supposed to be here. She is sitting at a table with colleagues and I go back for more because it\\u2019s so tasty! I want to try at least one of everything. I see my friend Mo from graduate school. I\\u2019m happily surprised to see him. He looks a bit sad. He tells me he\\u2019s been spending more time in San Francisco. I think that\\u2019s interesting because he lives in the East Bay. He says he\\u2019s been in SF more because he and his wife aren\\u2019t really doing well right now. He was married four or more years after me. I tell him he\\u2019ll be fine and his marriage will be okay because there are phases in a marriage when you don\\u2019t feel super connected, but you\\u2019ll come out of it and appreciate each other again. He\\u2019s hopeful but a bit weary to put his hope in my words. I look around and see that my guide has left. I tell him I have to go and hope to see him around later. I am looking for the group again. I\\u2019m in the huge conference center with many floors. There are start-up companies in meeting, people working on computers, miniature libraries with specialized topics for research. I\\u2019m wandering around and feeling lost. I find a woman sitting behind a glass - it looks like an information desk. I ask her about the group I\\u2019m looking for. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m more in charge of the people who rent space here for months and years rather than day visits.\\u201d She comes out from behind the glass and we go down the elevator. We get to an area that she says is their meeting space. It\\u2019s not at all familiar. I look way down and think I recognize some of the people. I really want to find them because I really want to go on this learning trek and know this is important knowledge to gather. She leaves me there and I\\u2019m trying to find my way down to the people. I feel at a complete loss and I\\u2019m lost.\"],[\"This dream is remembered mostly backwards. The last scene of the dream I look down at my phone and it\\u2019s lit up with Jeremy\\u2019s name. He\\u2019s calling. I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it\\u2019s him even though he\\u2019s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I\\u2019m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it\\u2019s not a video call, I can see him. He\\u2019s sitting on an oversized chair. He\\u2019s very awkward. He says, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s Jeremy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI know. Hi, how are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to be light. Then he says, \\u201cI owe you an explanation.\\u201d So then he starts to share. I can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I\\u2019m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It\\u2019s urgent. I\\u2019m running through snow. It\\u2019s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We\\u2019re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It\\u2019s a big pool and I\\u2019m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn\\u2019t notice that the water has been draining until it\\u2019s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I\\u2019m at dinner. It\\u2019s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in Hawaii by a lake, My parents and sister are nearby. I look down at the brown wet leaves at my feet. I see two snakes intertwined with each other. Then I\\u2019m shocked and worried because there aren\\u2019t supposed to be any snakes in Hawaii. I also know that Hawaii doesn\\u2019t have lakes, so I\\u2019m a bit confused, too. As I\\u2019m watching the snakes, I realize they\\u2019re mating and this is even worse because instead of just two snakes, there will be more and the island could be taken over by snakes. I look into the water and see another snake swimming in the water. As I watch, I realize it\\u2019s a huge anaconda and it\\u2019s undulating towards my mom, dad and sister. I yell at my parents and sister to warn them. I realize that I have to do something about this and find someone who can help me. Now I look at the ground again. The first two snakes are also anacondas - a lot larger than I first thought. There are also so many bathing snakes writhing around like earthworms, but they\\u2019re actually itty bitty baby snakes. I\\u2019m trying to cut them with a shovel. I can squash them with my shoes because I\\u2019m wearing flip flops and those won\\u2019t do. I\\u2019m looking for help and now realize that the snakes are a problem all over the island. I\\u2019m now at a hotel looking for more snakes and help. It\\u2019s late. I see Ted. We sit on a curb away from everyone else and have a talk before returning to our separate hotel rooms for the night.\"],[\"I'm a guest in a house similar to Swamiji\\u2019s home - a small community of people living together in a beautiful home on a hill. There is an extremely obese woman who we are trying to help downstairs. She\\u2019s so obese, she can\\u2019t walk. She\\u2019s also unable to talk, though her eyes are open and she is conscious. We have two ropes with heavy duty paper clips at the ends. The ropes are wrapped around her body. We swing one rope to the ceiling and it hooks up on the ceiling. The other rope is tied to the banister of the stairs. It\\u2019s a team effort. Two or three of us are trying to maneuver her down the stairs. We keep throwing the top rope to the ceiling, but then it hooks to places where it looks like it will pull the ceiling down. It\\u2019s like the ceiling is covered with a taut fabric and I\\u2019m concerned that the fabric will tear under her weight. We have to unhook the rope then hook it again. We get her down one flight of stairs and think we\\u2019re done. But then we look down and see more stairs. We are just at a loft area with a bed. I find myself attracted to the man who is helping, too. The other two helpers are women. While the others are resting on the loft and rebuilding their strength, I go upstairs for snack. Our friend has returned from the market and is preparing dinner. She offers me and my son some snacks - a bag of fresh plums that have just been picked and a bag of cornichon pickles. My son reaches into the pickle bag. Inside the bag is a little green car the same size and color as the pickles. I let him have it. We eat. While we are eating, a woman with black coiffed hair comes in the front door. She is the ex-girlfriend of the man who I was attracted to. She says that she has just returned from her travels and is going to drop her things off upstairs in his room. I go back downstairs and find that the others have moved downstairs to the healing pools. The obese woman is in her own warm pool soaking. The others are in another pool. The man is leaning against the side of the pool and his neck is sore from getting her downstairs. I slip into the water, too. I offer to help his neck, but he declines even though he is interested. He doesn\\u2019t want to ask more of me. Another woman who was helping asks if I can help her because she is also sore from the ordeal.\"],[\"I am hiding out with my husband at the border of Oregon and California. We are on the Oregon side in some bushes. We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We\\u2019ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we\\u2019ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn\\u2019t have to smear the lotion in the dog\\u2019s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they\\u2019re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They\\u2019ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I\\u2019m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I\\u2019m thinking that maybe he\\u2019ll drive because he isn\\u2019t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river. He has found a stick and a net on a long pole, like a pool skimmer. It\\u2019s broken around the edges and the net is slightly torn. A couple comes by with their dog on a leash. They let the dog off leash and the dog jumps in the water where my son was pretending to fish with his net. My son just stands and watches at first. But then he wants to try to fish for the dog. I tell him not to. There\\u2019s a little back and forth between us. I then tell my son that we will have to go to another part of the river or I\\u2019ll take away the net. I\\u2019d rather the people just leave with their dog instead of continuing to throw the stick into the water for the dog to fetch. Eventually I get my son to draw back and watch until they decide to leave.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a boat. I\\u2019m with my husband and son and somebody else, a captain who is directing the boat. There are other boats in the water. We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I\\u2019m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he\\u2019s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I\\u2019m looking around and notice it\\u2019s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I\\u2019m looking through the papers and see that there\\u2019s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I\\u2019m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He\\u2019s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It\\u2019s really rough and she hasn\\u2019t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It\\u2019s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I\\u2019m at a celebration for Ted, an award\\u2019s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I\\u2019m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there. His dad, who is dead in waking life, is there and drinking a huge glass mug of whisky and ice. His mom and I are sipping nicer whisky that I had brought. I make eye contact with him, smile and nod my head in congratulations for his accomplishments.\"],[\"All the women have gathered for my friend Talia\\u2019s birth. We\\u2019re inside a large room. She\\u2019s standing up higher and radiant in her pregnant fullness. She starts to feel labor beginning. We\\u2019re watching and singing and holding space. At one point, she\\u2019s in a smaller room. I hear her say that she pooped and a woman says, \\u201cgood, this is great, this is part of it.\\u201d Then another woman who sounds like my mother shames her for pooping. She says it\\u2019s not a good thing. I wish I was there to be another voice of support. She comes out of that room, clean and very much in the fire of crowning birth. I can see a redness and opening between her legs. She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We\\u2019re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She\\u2019s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby. I think I would not be happy if I were not the first to hold my baby. We all look and see that it is a healthy baby. We bring the baby back to Talia with love and devotion.\"],[\"Elevators going up and down. A mall. I\\u2019m with my childhood friend Elizabeth watching. People are wearing unusual clothes. Gwen is recording a podcast about inter-racial relationships. A group of us are gathered for the recording. The intro to the podcast is recorded by an Asian woman in a relationship with a black man. She is describing their relationship and it\\u2019s recorded like a guided meditation in a semi-darkened room. Then the lights turn on and Gwen is speaking about inter-racial relationships between white women and black men. I\\u2019m sitting beside her as support. The scene opens up and a white woman and black man are running. People are chasing and trying to track them down. They separate for safety and hope they can find each other again.\"],[\"Returning to the farm. Mexican laborers are all sleeping on the ground, passed out in sexual ecstasy, their pants down, all men. An investigation reveals that one man found a long crystal in the dirt and in secret stimulated himself until he orgasmed and fell asleep. Somehow the other men understood what happened and used the crystal, as well. Returning to the farm, a group of people are having their own experiences and judgments. There\\u2019s a beautiful ballerina with bright red lipstick. She is the object of attraction and desire, but she has none herself. So when she feels his attraction for her, she pretends sleep. She sees herself from the outside, her face pushed up with bright red lipstick smudged on her nose. She\\u2019d like to fix her face and make herself more beautiful in her sleep, but moving would betray that she was still awake. So she stays and she sees on her cheek the evidence of pimples and many breakouts when she was younger and wishes that away. But he stands over her and wishes for her warmth, wishes for connection. And they\\u2019re both alone in their thoughts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m waking up at a festival. I\\u2019m walking through to the ocean or bay. I see that some others are still sleeping and the beds are set up to be floating over the ocean with only a white gauze curtain around for a little privacy. I\\u2019m curious about it. I see my friend Maxine walking around in a huge hoop skirt. It looks like she\\u2019s wearing a long curly wig that goes all the way to the ground. Other people are dressed up in festival attire. I don\\u2019t think I am, but I can\\u2019t sense much about myself. There\\u2019s a water slide that people go down to splash in the water. I\\u2019m supposed to be covering Sophie\\u2019s shift. I don\\u2019t know whether it starts at 9 or 9:30, but I need to get there. But now it\\u2019s raining and grey, and I know I\\u2019m in San Francisco. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019ll get there and park and be on time. It\\u2019s more complicated than I thought it would be when I agreed to help. Now I realize it\\u2019s not a chiropractic shift, but I\\u2019m subbing a yoga or meditation class for her. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in another doctor\\u2019s office. It smells like cigarette smoke and really stuffy. All the other rooms are occupied and the doctor of physical therapist is running late. There isn\\u2019t enough room to teach a class and it won\\u2019t be worth my time or energy to do this, but I\\u2019ve committed. Then there\\u2019s a scene of my sister lying on her stomach and a prince speaking with her and evaluating whether she is a good choice for him or not.\"],[\"Food is being served on long tables set against each other end to end. There are big circular plates of a frittata like food with some light purple-pink sauce poured on top. There is an order for who is to get the food first, but there are mothers of young children who are pushing to the front and making a mess of things with their plates. They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates. She is justifying her actions saying, \\u201cThis is for my son and this is for my daughter and this is for my husband.\\u201d She keeps putting more and more pieces on her plate while people are hungrily pushing forward against us. I have my plate and at first just cut one piece, but then I get just a little more, then just a little more, beginning to feel the scarcity of hunger and not knowing if there will be enough. Then I\\u2019m upstairs in the same building and alone. It\\u2019s an old stone building without windows, but rather openings carved into the thick stone walls. There are two young boys who have been brainwashed in some way. They are putting stones in the openings to cover the light. As they do this, they are turning the building into marsh. I can see green vines growing from wherever they touch. I\\u2019m panicking then trying to control my breath and clear my mind so I can make a plan to save this all from collapsing and turning into marsh.\"],[\"There is a land we must pass through. I\\u2019m with a big group of people. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them from waking life. We get to a point where the tigers are. We\\u2019re strategizing and learning how to get through. We\\u2019re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It\\u2019s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don\\u2019t have anyone to pair off with, so I\\u2019m going through the motions by myself. I\\u2019m also wary of holding people\\u2019s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don\\u2019t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I\\u2019ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don\\u2019t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I\\u2019m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I\\u2019m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties. I\\u2019m sad and disappointed, I feel left out because they haven\\u2019t thought to invite me. I would like to be included.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Alice and we\\u2019re preparing an offering. People are gathered inside a tent, sitting around square wooden tables. They are all crowded around the tables waiting. I\\u2019m sitting next to Alice at the table. Right in front of me is a thick spider web. I can see spiders crawling on the web. It seems to be thickening with more layers. I stand up and back up. I look at her and say to her, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re attracting more bugs.\\u201d She laughs. A tall white woman with blonde hair is sitting across from us. I don\\u2019t recognize her from waking life. She is holding feathers. She says, \\u201cIt would be nice if we could bless the elements and call in the ancestors because we really need to talk to the ancestors. We begin the ceremony. Alice is playing music. It\\u2019s kind of off. Alice is playing pop songs and I\\u2019m trying to lead an embodiment practice and meditation. We are not in sync. In another scene, I\\u2019m with a group of strong men. I notice the strength of their upper bodies. They must be physically strong for what lies ahead. I\\u2019m helping to prepare them. There is also something about blood.\"],[\"I am walking through a downtown area. The streets are dark and wet. I\\u2019m looking for a hotel restaurant and spa. I find it and it\\u2019s larger and more elegant on the inside than it appears on the outside. I go to the concierge to make an appointment at the spa. They tell me to wait in the lobby and come back when they call my name. I look over the different treatment options on the spa menu. There are only women here - it\\u2019s a women only spa. I see Rose who I think is applying for a job here as a sexocological bodyworker and some other women I don\\u2019t recognize from waking life. After some time passes, they call me up to the desk. They give me a large ticket printed on brown cardstock. It has my name on the front and information for my first time. Then they give me my assigned therapist who will give me my treatment. They lead me to the back. I go down the stairs behind them. Instead of going directly to the spa, I go to the restaurant. It\\u2019s huge with tall ceilings. People are spaced out at different tables. I sit at my assigned table. A couple other people join me. I look at the menu and the food is unusual - fine dining breakfast/brunch. I order. The food arrives and it\\u2019s a crystallized strawberry fluff. It\\u2019s delicious. The person across from me is a chef and she\\u2019s talking about how she makes a strawberry ice cream. She gets the largest strawberries and cuts them in slices and places them together to make something like a boat. She makes the ice cream from scratch. The other person sitting next to me says, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s the most wonderful thing you\\u2019ve ever had!\\u201d She promises me an invitation to a dinner party at her home. I love the idea of going to a chef\\u2019s home for dinner. Meanwhile, the spa therapists are coming around and finding the people they recognize for their treatments - there are a lot of regulars here and I might be the only new person. I\\u2019m assigned to a person named Shannon. I think they are a woman. This person comes down and everyone knows and loves her. She is one of the most sought after therapists. She is being discreet, looking around for her client, not calling out names, because we are all supposed to be anonymous here. Then she starts singing a song about herself because we don\\u2019t recognize each other. Now I realize that she identifies as \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are tall, brown skin with big black hair, very lean and strong. I realize, \\u201cThis is Shannon.\\u201d I try to get their attention once they complete their song. Most of the others have gone to receive their treatment. I reach into my bag to get my ticket. I can\\u2019t find it at first and am concerned that I won\\u2019t be able to receive my session without it. It\\u2019s tucked in between notebooks and other papers. I take it out and show them my name and their name printed on the ticket. We go out and I don\\u2019t recall the treatment. Afterwards, I\\u2019m on a beach. My dad is sitting on a beach chair next to me. There\\u2019s another older man sitting next to him and some young adults in their late twenties sitting on a surfboard in front of us. My dad comments on one of the gals wearing a little bitty red one piece swimsuit. Her body is very young and firm. My dad talks to the old man next to him, assuming the young woman is this old man\\u2019s girlfriend. He tells the old man how lucky he is. I\\u2019m disgusted by the conversation between them. I get up and walk to the shore. I see small creatures digging holes in the sand after the waves go out. I dig a hole and am finding crawdads and am pulling them out while trying to avoid their claws. I look out at the ocean. The water is so clear. I see turtles and then this creature. At first I think the creature is another turtle, but when I look more closely, it\\u2019s like a dolphin with an elephant trunk. I point it out to people. We realize that the young woman who the men were talking about is the fiancee of the older man\\u2019s son. They all go inside a dive bar and are ordering drinks and cigars and talking about the plans for the rest of the night. It\\u2019s getting late and I\\u2019m wishing to be somewhere else.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Anya, Moira, Kel, and a new patient who I haven\\u2019t met yet. The office is down the street from a big house that is being used for multiple offices. I\\u2019m in the house. Anya and Kel are helping me set up the tables upstairs. People are arriving for sessions. A fire is lit in the fireplace. It\\u2019s dark and musty. There are quite a few massage and chiropractic tables folded in their traveling bags. There are tables and stacked chairs. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to set up the table for privacy and professionalism for my new patient, but it\\u2019s chaotic. This is a way for me to practice and for people to watch me work and potentially become patients.\"],[\"I can only remember two bits from an extensive dream. I\\u2019m walking down a city street. There are steps leading up to a second story restaurant. It\\u2019s an elegant cafe. I go up the stairs with my son. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I\\u2019m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we\\u2019ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I\\u2019ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he\\u2019s gone. He\\u2019s not on the stairs. I\\u2019m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s gone. In another scene, I\\u2019m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I\\u2019m at the baths. I\\u2019m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She\\u2019s watching the cat while the cat\\u2019s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I\\u2019m trying to pretend that I don\\u2019t know Ursula so that the woman doesn\\u2019t connect me with Ursula\\u2019s former apprentice.\"],[\"I accept Garth\\u2019s invitation to come and visit. He is staying in a multi level apartment building. I go by myself and knock on his door. His wife and daughter aren\\u2019t there, they just had a really big fight and his wife has left with their daughter. He invites me to sit down on the couch so I can do my work. I have my laptop. I sit on a fluffy green couch. He has all the ergonomic things and is handing me something to hold the computer and another thing to cancel the EMF and another thing to support my neck. He\\u2019s being attentive to me in all those ways. He invites me to put the computer down and sit next to him. I think about it for a while, then I do. He draws me closer to him. I pull back because I don\\u2019t want to betray her friendship. I want to open a conversation about their relationship to see if there's anything I can do to help mend the wounds. I know that cuddling him and giving him physical comfort wouldn\\u2019t be good for any of our relationships.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the bathroom with a couple other women. We are getting ready. They\\u2019re in and out of the shower. One woman is really fit and looks like she does yoga regularly. She is jumping up and down and dancing in the bathtub as she\\u2019s showering. She says she uses every opportunity to move her body. There\\u2019s something waiting outside the bathroom. It feels ritualistic and dark, involving blood, but I can\\u2019t recall anything more.\"],[\"Somehow I\\u2019m able to see the priestess message board and the communications that are occuring, written in gold filigree on a black background. I can see the names of the current priestesses and little gold fairies and the teachings being recorded here. I don\\u2019t know if they can tell I\\u2019m here observing. Ursula looks up as if she knows I\\u2019m here and I\\u2019m wondering if my name is appearing on the board as someone present and watching. The messages begin to disappear. The names are changed. I can\\u2019t understand them any longer. But I know one is her daughter and she is the \\u201cseanalair\\u201d or the \\u201cseantian.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m swimming underwater with really bright colorful fish and coral contrasted by big black octopus, seal, shark and people swimming in snorkel or scuba gear. I\\u2019m struck by the contrast between color and black.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a crowded dinner party. We haven\\u2019t sat down to eat yet. We\\u2019re all going in and out of the kitchen putting together a bunch of different salads and setting the table. They\\u2019re mostly young adults in their twenties, just out of college it seems. I get a phone call from a landline. It\\u2019s Ted. I can hardly hear him because of all the activity in the kitchen and people with their pots and pans and multiple conversations. I can hear the gist of it. He\\u2019s having a hard time. I suggest he come in for some care. He makes a comment that is the closest thing to being overt about his attraction to me that I\\u2019ve ever heard. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWill it be okay for you to treat someone who\\u2019s hitting on you?\\u201d I'm thinking about all the rules and regulations and if this would be okay because I would like to see him. The conversations in the kitchen get louder and someone asks me to set the table so I have to go. There\\u2019s a shift in the dream. There\\u2019s a young couple in a courtyard. Tables are set up for an event. The couple is wandering through. They\\u2019ve met each other here and are wanting to extend the night. They\\u2019re walking around and I\\u2019m watching them. They\\u2019re falling in love as the day and evening go by. Their families arrive and for some reason they\\u2019re not supposed to be together. The families overlook it for now. The dream goes by and they\\u2019re spending more time together. He\\u2019s painting her and writing about her. His family forbids them from seeing each other. But she\\u2019s moved in with him. She\\u2019s packing to go and she shows him where she has stored papers and journals beside his bed. She says, \\u201cIf you miss me and want to know me better, look through these papers.\\u201d There are empty plastic organizing folders and receipt folders filled with receipts from 2007 or 2017. She points out the years and says, \\u201cIf you want to know who I was back then, you can look at these.\\u201d She\\u2019s being transparent about her past. She has to leave and she does. They make an arrangement to meet at a sporting goods store in the future. She walks in and there are people taking a physical therapy exercise class at the back of the store and there are different exercise stations throughout the store. People are trying out the equipment and taking class. She wanders to the back and meets people and thinks she could help them more at her office. But she realizes they only have to pay $5 a class here and they are getting some help here. She sees him and they have to pretend they haven\\u2019t. She wanders to the front of the store where there are two television screens set up showing an exercise dance class. It\\u2019s an interesting setup because one television shows the front of the teacher and the other shows the back of the teacher, so it\\u2019s easier to follow along. He sees her dancing and walks over to sit near her and set up his art exhibit. Then his mom comes in and she\\u2019s dressed primly. She\\u2019s paging through the book the couple had made together - the woman has written the words and he\\u2019s drawn the pictures. A lot of the pictures are of the young woman. The mom is flipping through the book. There are pictures of the mom, too. She\\u2019s pretending to not be impressed but it is truly a fabulous piece of art. She\\u2019s there to lead a group of young girls in a dance performance. The girls are dressed in overcoats and hats with flowers. She\\u2019s so stern. At the end of the performance, instead of congratulating them on their performance, she coldly walks away.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a street, it\\u2019s dark and wet, like it\\u2019s been raining all day. It\\u2019s not currently raining. I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called \\u201cKali\\u2019s Eyes.\\u201d I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn\\u2019t functioning well and I can\\u2019t find what I\\u2019m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I\\u2019ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it\\u2019s really crowded. I\\u2019m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they\\u2019ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can\\u2019t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I\\u2019m frustrated. It\\u2019s also still COVID, so it\\u2019s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that\\u2019s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I\\u2019d like to sit on, but they\\u2019ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it\\u2019s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It\\u2019s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They\\u2019re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other\\u2019s faces, so it\\u2019s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It\\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\\u2019t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night, after hours, and I\\u2019m at the coffee shop - next door and outside. There are bins of spices. The owner of the coffee shop who I know socially is pouring the spices from the containers he used during the day and into the larger bulk bins. I see he accidentally mixes the salt and cayenne, pouring the salt into the cayenne bin and the cayenne into the salt bin. He\\u2019s distracted. He doesn\\u2019t realize what he\\u2019s doing in the moment. He realizes that I\\u2019m there and then notices his mistake and realizes he ruined the salt and cayenne and they\\u2019re basically unusable. Jeremy is here now. They are both implicating me and saying that I caused him to make this mistake and brought an evil omen.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at the table with my bodywork teacher and people who are new to his work and paying for continuing education. He invites me to stay, listen and learn again anything I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down an alley between row houses. I\\u2019m with my husband. We walk by this one house with people gathered in the front. It\\u2019s a neighborhood block party. The front of their house is decorated with so many succulents of all shapes, sizes and colors, some in boxes, others growing like vines. I comment that \\u201cSnow and Shelly\\u201d would like it. But I mean \\u201cHanna\\u201d and I wonder why I keep calling her Snow? We continue to walk a little further. I hear them laughing about their friends \\u201cSlow\\u201d which is their nickname for Hanna and Shelly together. Then my husband and I get to the end of the alley. There\\u2019s a curio shop with all kinds of odds and ends. There\\u2019s a sign that looks like a fish and you can tell that it maybe once said Carmel, but part of it is missing so you only see the C at the fish\\u2019s face and the E-L at the tail. Then my husband reaches up and touches an interesting looking tapestry. He touches the border and tells me to touch it, too. It\\u2019s a really soft silky hair and leather texture, beautifully crafted. My husband takes it down and brings it inside. There\\u2019s an older woman dressed in a white lace bohemian dress behind the counter. There are two dogs running around. The dogs go from being really well behaved to one reaching for my fist with his mouth. While the woman is helping us check out, another dog starts running through the store and is being destructive. The man who is her husband and owns the shop with her comes out from behind the desk and goes after the dog to get him and rangle him back behind the desk along with the other one. I look at the tapestry and it\\u2019s no longer a rug, now it\\u2019s a dead dog that has been taxidermied. Now I understand why the leather was so smooth and shiny - it was once a shiny short haired soft dog. I don\\u2019t want it anymore. She says it\\u2019s really good for spellwork, protection and keeping the negative energies at bay. The man comes back and says, \\u201cYes it\\u2019s such a shame, the three dogs used to be a crew together. It\\u2019s a shame to see them separated now.\\u201d He is encouraging us to take it even though I\\u2019m apprehensive about having a dead dog in my house. Then there\\u2019s this yellow and white huge snake behind the counter next to the man. He taps the snake on the head and it starts to move. I can see its body starting to unknot from it\\u2019s sleeping position. It\\u2019s coming out from behind the desk and pushing the woman to the side. She stands back respectfully. I guess this is also one of their pets. The snake continues to unwind. The face kind of looks plastic but it\\u2019s acting real. I\\u2019m making sure to get out of the way. I\\u2019m trying to leave the shop and my husband is on the other side of the snake, also trying to get out. The snake continues to unwind and as it does, it is so huge, there is no tail in sight. Its body is filling every part of the shop. I can see the man trying to pull the snake back. I can see my husband trying to push through the body of the snake and trying to get out. Just as we reach the threshold, I see the snake open her mouth really wide and I see her fangs and tongue. The tongue is yellow and white and in the same pattern as the body. We get out.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house that looks a lot like my grandmother\\u2019s house except the ceilings are really, really high. It\\u2019s like a modular home. I\\u2019m with my mom in the kitchen and my dad somewhere and my sister somewhere. My aunt is there, too. I guess the whole family that usually gathers for Thanksgiving is there. My mom is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m with her and we\\u2019re baking bread. The counters are already covered with loaves of bread. It smells so good! There are some artisan loaves that we\\u2019re just finishing up. We\\u2019ve just tried this new style of baking and we\\u2019re looking forward to trying it. I take those loaves out of the oven and place them on the counter. We slice some pieces of bread, sampling different loaves for the meal we\\u2019re preparing. I step out of the kitchen and walk down the hall. I go into my grandmother\\u2019s bedroom. This is when I notice the ceilings are really high and there\\u2019s a loft. Also, her bedroom is on the opposite side of the hall than it was in waking life. There\\u2019s a wall partition and around the corner is a big green bed, her bed. There\\u2019s a little area with toys - a little kids table and bright primary colors, a little hammer, balls and art supplies. She set it up for the grandchildren to play with. I see my aunt up the ladder on the loft preparing a couple beds for the family to sleep. There\\u2019s also a bed downstairs with a pink bedspread. We\\u2019re preparing the house so everyone can rest. I go out and see my sister and grandmother in the laundry room, which she also didn\\u2019t have in real life. They\\u2019re taking Christmas decorations out of boxes. They\\u2019re taking out candy canes that are individually wrapped in plastic, then wrapped again in bunches. My sister and grandmother are taking the candy canes out - they\\u2019re all different colors, rainbow, blue, purple, solid red. I don\\u2019t see the traditional red and white striped candy canes. It\\u2019s so good to see my grandmother even though I only see her from behind. It feels like Thanksgivings and Christmases in the past.\"],[\"We\\u2019re in the Prizer\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the middle of the night and we\\u2019ve let ourselves in. Everybody in the household is asleep except for their youngest son. This must be years ago or time has shifted because he\\u2019s a little boy and not a young man. The house is in disarray. There must have been a big party the night before. We\\u2019re not supposed to be here but we wanted a place to rest that was warm inside. We expected that we could probably slip in after the party and no one would know because they would be sleeping deeply. The little boy has curly red hair. He\\u2019s in the pantry hiding and he sees us. Then other people in the household start to stir. We try to sneak away, but then Mrs. P comes downstairs into the kitchen. She\\u2019s obviously surprised but too polite to say anything or question us because she thinks maybe her husband invited us to stay. I\\u2019m in the kitchen helping clean up and making myself look useful or invited or hired to help clean up after the party. My husband slips away and goes down the driveway. It\\u2019s still dark and now it\\u2019s raining. He sets up the car top tent. I\\u2019m able to sneak away eventually. I think I\\u2019m upset that he\\u2019s upset. I kick the ladder of the tent and shake the tent a lot to make him wake up. He\\u2019s not happy that I\\u2019ve woken him. But I feel like we have to get going.\"],[\"I\\u2019m giving a session to Gemma outside in a courtyard. There\\u2019s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He\\u2019s good friends with Gemma, maybe they\\u2019re lovers. I\\u2019m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she\\u2019s going to the dinner later. I\\u2019m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, \\u201cThank you, that was really great.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting feedback but there isn\\u2019t time. Some other things happen and it\\u2019s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can\\u2019t come in because he\\u2019s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It\\u2019s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I\\u2019m not quite sure what they are because they\\u2019ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn\\u2019t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn\\u2019t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they\\u2019re much larger than me. I\\u2019m either really far away or I\\u2019ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I\\u2019m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It\\u2019s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It\\u2019s an ornate room with wood floors. There\\u2019s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they\\u2019re going to trap me, I\\u2019ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month\\u2019s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I\\u2019m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it\\u2019s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn\\u2019t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji\\u2019s ashram comes in and she\\u2019s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I\\u2019m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn\\u2019t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019ve been banished and will never be able to return. You\\u2019re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.\\u201d She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.\\u201d She laughs. I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don\\u2019t realize that I\\u2019m the one who took the entire community\\u2019s water.\"],[\"It\\u2019s just sort of a grey light. There are people sitting in chairs spaced for social distancing and scattered around. Somebody is sitting up front pointing an old wrinkled finger at people. Each time the finger points, the person is recognized as empathetic and kind. This finger is pointing at each of the people in chairs. As the finger gets to me, they hesitate. I see Jeremy sitting up there with the old one and he whispers to him, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t point to her.\\u201d It\\u2019s really unsettling and disturbing to me. The old one\\u2019s finger does point to me and recognizes me as kind. I wonder why Jeremy is so bent on seeing me otherwise.\"],[\"I\\u2019m riding on a horse with a group of others. A woman and a young girl of about six or seven are riding on a horse together. The horses make a sharp turn and the woman and girl fall of their horse. The girl gets up on her own and seems fine. The woman needs more help.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a small airport waiting for my friend. There\\u2019s only one gate. One plane has already left. They\\u2019re calling up people who have asked for refunds for their tickets as well as people who have been reassigned to later flights. I go up and stand in line. People are crowded together, bodies pressed up against each other, and pushing up against the person at the help desk. I say, \\u201cBack up!\\u201d Then everyone remembers COVID and they organize in two lines, breathing quietly and in a more restrained way.\"],[\"I\\u2019m bleeding and it\\u2019s not my time to bleed.\"],[\"I\\u2019m supposed to co-teach a yoga class with Les. People have arrived at the hotel. I\\u2019m there and walking around the room talking to the students. Then I realize I\\u2019m wearing a short white cotton dress. The room is heating up for class. I realize I\\u2019ll sweat and this dress will be transparent and I won\\u2019t be able to demo in it. I look up at the clock and see that I have just enough time to slip over to the boutique and pick up some yoga clothes. When I get there, the people are really helpful. They give me a bodysuit. I slip it on but it doesn\\u2019t look good at all. It\\u2019s taking a lot more time than I expected and there aren\\u2019t many other appropriate options for my body or teaching. Then I find a little pair of stretchy corduroy shorts and a top. I pull them on and think it will do. I go back and when I get back, the class is almost over and I\\u2019ve missed the whole thing while I was trying to find appropriate clothes to teach in.\"],[\"I walk into a bar, sort of. There are a few guys, couples sitting on stools and one man behind the bar. All seem to work here. I sit on a stool and ask for a cup and hot water so I can make my own tea. My husband comes in and walks behind the bar. He\\u2019s casually leaning back against the bar and talking with the people. We all seem to know each other. I\\u2019m wondering where my son is. He comes in and passes through. Then I don\\u2019t see him for a while. I assume he\\u2019s with somebody who\\u2019s watching him. The guy from behind the bar comes over to my cup because I\\u2019ve asked him for a tea strainer. Instead of giving me a tea strainer, he pours warm milk into my cup. Then he pours a huge amount of loose tea, so much so that it is overflowing from the cup. I\\u2019m surprised and ask him what he\\u2019s doing. He says, \\u201cOh it\\u2019s really, really good tea. Just wait and see.\\u201d I think he\\u2019s ruined my cup of tea so I sit back and let it steep, whatever he\\u2019s done. I start to get worried because I haven\\u2019t seen my son in a while. I look around and see that he\\u2019s not in this room where I thought he was. I ask my husband if he\\u2019s seen him or knows who he\\u2019s with. He doesn\\u2019t know and he isn\\u2019t concerned. I\\u2019m looking around frantically and see a ladder to an upstairs loft. I think he might be up there. I climb up. On the upper floor are lots of beds separated by curtains, lots of cushions and pillows. I see a little girl curled up asleep. But I don\\u2019t see my son or anyone else. I\\u2019m getting more frantic and worried. I see a door that leads outside to this big grassy area. My husband comes up the ladder and asks me if I found him. We go out to the garden and are looking around. An older man comes strolling up to us. He asks us how we\\u2019re doing and wants to strike up a conversation. I\\u2019m not interested in pausing for a conversation because I need to find my son. My husband looks across the way and asks, \\u201cWhere is the most likely place he could be?\\u201d I see a big climbing dome and a lot of kids playing on a playground. We go running over there. I\\u2019m looking all around and calling for him. Finally I see him and I\\u2019m so relieved to see him. I pull him to me tight and I\\u2019m both angry and happy. Then, there\\u2019s an overlap with another dream layered on top of it. I find out Hanna and Shelly are moving and selling their house. I\\u2019m over there and I\\u2019m sad that they\\u2019re moving. I enjoyed living in the same town. Hanna pulls me to the side and says, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not actually moving from the town. We\\u2019re just selling the house and downsizing because we can get a really high price for it. We\\u2019ve found a smaller house.\\u201d Shelly is fixing up the well and has dug out a big hole beside it. I go inside to look around. I go into the bathroom and Hanna shows me some weights. She says, \\u201cShelly lost it and got really angry and threw the weights around.\\u201d I ask if they\\u2019re all okay. She says, \\u201cYes, we\\u2019re all fine. This just happens sometimes.\\u201d They are not planning on telling anyone about the details about their move because they don\\u2019t want that to lower the price that they can get for the house.\"],[\"There is a dance ritual to perform tonight. I\\u2019m up high on a mountain with a flat area, like a plateau with sheer cliffs rather than a mountain peak. Some structures have been built up here. The ritual is for the sun. i don\\u2019t know if the sun is setting or rising. It\\u2019s very dark. All I see at the horizon is an orange ball of light. There\\u2019s a change of plans. Now the ritual is happening in the pool. There are a lot of people. The only one I recognize is a mama friend. We talk on the steps leading into the pool. I don\\u2019t recall anything about the conversation or the ritual. I\\u2019m talking with Mary about human origins. She says something about the latest research and the shape of your legs. She says she can tell me about my origin by holding my breasts in her hands to weigh them and get a sense of them and me. I agree and shift my shirt and bra to the side. She does so. She says, \\u201cOh you are a brigar peggis mortae.\\u201d She steps back and points to these flanks hanging up on hooks. They\\u2019re samples of different species. She points to the one that is my origin. I can see that each of the forms have differently shaped acetabuli. I think, \\u201cOh! This shape is why I never could be a professional ballerina.\\u201d I see other shapes that would have allowed me a better turnout for ballet.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in underground baths of cement or rock. There are different rooms with baths carved into the rock face as well as sinks. There\\u2019s a long hallway with rooms off to the right. I go all the way down to the last room. There are no doors. I walk in and go to the sink. I look down to my left and see a big communal bath that has been drained of water. There are brightly colored square pillows arranged in a circle in preparation for a sound bath or meditation of some kind. Two people, a young man and woman, are sitting in the center with their backs to each other and their arms hooked. They look like the typical kind of people you\\u2019d see at Esalen before it became more popularized and fancy. They are startled when they see me and yelp and move away from each other as if being close to each other is not allowed and they don\\u2019t want to be seen breaking the social rules. I don\\u2019t care about the rules though. I go back out and see one of my patients walking down the hall with her child. She doesn\\u2019t have a child in waking life, but this girl is a toddler. There\\u2019s a black leather wallet on the ground being pushed to the side. It\\u2019s open and I can see folded bills and credit cards. I feel like I need to explain myself to my patient and let her know we didn\\u2019t quarantine because we were isolated while we were away. Then my son comes running down the hall. He\\u2019s wild and out of control like he\\u2019s been in waking life. It\\u2019s so hard to know what to do with him. Later in the dream I\\u2019m hiding out in the car, getting a moment to myself. My husband is dropping our son off at a communal outside area with green grass, dome huts and underground rooms, like a hobbit village. While I\\u2019m hiding out in the car, a family I know comes by and they knock on the window. They have two daughters, one the same age as my son and the other just over one. They say hi and ask if I\\u2019m coming. I shake my head and say no.\"],[\"We\\u2019re setting up for a day at the office, my husband and I. There are suddenly so many people. My husband has six or ten tables set up in a row and every table has a person lying on it. I have my four tables at the end set up perpendicular to his. The tables are really close together so I go to help him rearrange the tables, staggering them by pulling one forward and the next bag. The people stay on the tables while we\\u2019re doing this. Then I lie down on a table so he can check me before I start my day. It takes a really long time for him to get to me. By the time he takes care of me and I go to my people, two of the four are gone. They got frustrated with waiting and I can see why - it\\u2019s been about forty minutes and I\\u2019m running late. I work on the two people remaining then leave to go find the other two. One is in a building next door, it\\u2019s like a mall. She\\u2019s shopping for meditation cushions and some new clothes. We talk and things are okay between us - she just needed to run some errands, but she\\u2019ll come back. She tells me how she has a scholarship to study and they\\u2019re providing room and board for free. She\\u2019ll be staying at the tents. Whoever they are, they are extremely wealthy and they\\u2019re idea of camping is extremely nice. She shows me the camping setup. It\\u2019s a tall and long domed structure made of clay. The beds are set up on a long loft that goes across the entire length of the structure, and they\\u2019re actual beds, not sleeping bags. It\\u2019s warm, too. After the tour, we go down to the bottom floor. As we\\u2019re walking out, a whale is nudging her face through the doorway. Somehow, the structure has been built over deep water. So the whale is pushing her head out and agitating an elephant standing just at the other side of the threshold. I look up and see Kundry sitting atop the elephant. The elephant brings down her head and her trunk gets entangled with the whale. It\\u2019s hard to tell if they\\u2019re in conflict or greeting each other. Kundry is taken down and they get all twisted together. There\\u2019s another large grey animal getting involved, but I can\\u2019t tell what it is.\"],[\"There are four separate interrelated scenes - a really nice apartment condo by the ocean; a little Cobb style house that once belonged to Jeremy; a lovely home and office built around a tree at a retreat center; and a hospital in Hawaii. I am moving into a really nice condo. It\\u2019s modern with new appliances, white walls, high ceilings, big floor to ceiling windows with a view of the ocean from every room. The ocean is choppy and dark, but beautiful. I\\u2019ve never been to New England but it seems like the Atlantic ocean of the northeastern United States. The rent is extremely affordable and I\\u2019m wondering why. I\\u2019m living with a childhood friend (we really only knew each other when I was an infant and he was five) and another woman who comes and goes. We are learning how to live with each other, learning each other\\u2019s rhythms with cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and working. The refrigerator is full of delicious food - produce and prepared meals. I go to see where he is. He\\u2019s napping on a couch with a book across his chest. He has his head towards me then he senses that I\\u2019m there on the couch and he turns his body so his feet are towards me. His knees are open and I feel a warmth and desire awaken in my body. I crawl up towards him and it surprises us both even though there has been an attraction between our souls since the beginning of my life. We go into the kitchen and there is a tentative quality to our interaction now, feeling each other out and this new expression of our relationship. I wrap my legs around him and kiss him. Then for a moment he switches to my dad then switches back. That was weird. But there is a beautiful connection and fluidity in the way we are together. It\\u2019s as if we were made to be together, but waking life circumstances didn\\u2019t work in our favor. Then I learn that the reason this condo is so affordable is because there are cameras everywhere set to film us making love. It\\u2019s like a pornography studio. I don\\u2019t really know what to make of it. But I love being here at the ocean and with him, so it\\u2019s okay. Then, the dream shifts. I am walking by a little Cobb style cottage that was for sale, but now it looks like someone has recently bought it and moved in. I think this house once belonged to Jeremy and Zoe. It\\u2019s really crafty. There are waves carved over the mantel and the front door. It\\u2019s tan and brown, really of the earth. There\\u2019s a wooden fence all around and a little garden. Inside, a fire is burning in the fireplace. Herbs are hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is warm and carved of wood. Everything is just enough and just right. No one is home. I go in through the door in the back and am walking around, curious to see if it feels like home to me. In a way, it does. I make a cup of tea and sit in front of the fire. Then I get a sense that whoever lives here will be returning home soon, so I need to make it look like I wasn\\u2019t there, moving things back and covering up my presence. I leave and walk around the corner past the front. This is when I see this symbolic spiral wave over the front door and I can see through the door and walls to how the design over the mantel is a continuation of this design. I walk away into another scene. I\\u2019m with my mom, dad and sister. We are touring a gorgeous place with a real estate agent. It\\u2019s a home modeled around a huge tree. It\\u2019s built in the round, like a spiral. There\\u2019s a lovely glass sunroom that wraps nearly all around and a deck around that. When you walk in, there\\u2019s the tree trunk, a fireplace and a sitting area with long curving couches designed for this space. A doorway leads to a spacious bedroom which I don\\u2019t go into yet. The home spirals to the right to a beautiful kitchen with an island. It\\u2019s a community kitchen with a pantry stocked full. It continues into a laundry room and a room for the cats. As we are in the kitchen, another group comes in and goes upstairs. The real estate is angry because we now know how public this home is - anyone who lives at the retreat center has full access to this kitchen and to the offices upstairs. There is a recording studio and office with computers and printer upstairs. It is quite loud and we realize it won\\u2019t be a private home. We are still interested though. She shows us through the laundry room to the glass sunroom and cat walk that spirals around the front. It\\u2019s warm and bright and there is a cat lounging in the sun. I love it. She takes us upstairs to this beautiful office. Everything is furnished and lovely. We go back downstairs and into the spacious bedroom. I realize this is an apartment in and of itself. It\\u2019s big and open. There\\u2019s a fireplace where you can roast potatoes in the ashes. There are old fashioned iron stovetops with terracotta pots set on top to radiate warmth into the space. They are cooking a feast of roasted chickens and breads and other kinds of meat and vegetables. It smells so good. I tell my dad, \\u201cHow wonderful would it be to learn how to use these stoves and cook these gorgeous meals?!\\u201d I go down one step to look at the bedroom to see if it will be good for my husband, son and me. There\\u2019s a huge bed. The room feels spacious and it\\u2019s flooded with sunlight. I love it. On the far side of the bedroom is something like a clear plastic tent tarp. Through it I see seven beds lined up against the wall. They are covered with colorful pillows and it\\u2019s so bright and inviting. There\\u2019s a paper with instructions for how to set up the pillows so they all fit. I think how wonderful it would be to invite friends over. I want to negotiate with the realtor about renting just this part of the treehouse, not the whole place. She won\\u2019t get as much of a commission as she wanted, but maybe she\\u2019ll be happy to have something rather than nothing. As we are leaving, we are putting on our shoes on the deck just outside the front door. My dad is trying to be funny. We have the same kind of shoes - brown plastic slippers. He\\u2019s trying to put on one of my shoes but it of course doesn\\u2019t fit. I tell him to give me back my shoe. Then I\\u2019m in a hospital in Hawaii. I\\u2019m partially in a room with a curtain and partially outside. My best friend from middle school is giving birth. They are torturing her, pushing on her stomach, squeezing and twisting. She\\u2019s in so much pain. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do it that way! You\\u2019re hurting her and the baby!\\u201d I think the baby is dead inside her. She\\u2019s exhausted. I\\u2019m also pregnant and giving birth. I won\\u2019t let anyone touch me. I feel my own stomach and the baby\\u2019s head is down and to the left and okay. I\\u2019m watching people rush around because this is an emergency room. A friend from college, is the doctor. I ask him to check me because I think I can trust him not to harm me or my baby. He approaches me tentatively. He is still unsure of himself around me because I rejected him so many years ago. He has a butter knife with what looks like raw ground beef on it. He puts a towel over me and checks. He brings the knife up and there is blood dripping from it onto his nose. There\\u2019s a look in his eyes like, \\u201cThis could have been my baby.\\u201d He is sad about the loss of our friendship and his desire to be in relationship. The labor is continuing and getting stronger. I look out into the city scene. It\\u2019s mostly grey and full of the sounds of a busy city. Through the grey I see bright red and yellow, the colors of Hawaiian royalty. The Hawaiians have joined together with their drums and are playing the rhythm of life, birth and death. I drum along with them on my belly as if my tummy is an ipu. I see one man stand up above the rest with his drum and he\\u2019s so full of vitality and passion. The passion and rhythm are in such contrast to the city, but this is what I tune into - the red and yellow and drums.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving across the Golden Gate Bridge. It\\u2019s been remodeled and this road is higher than the older road. People go really fast across, one car at a time. There are plastic bumpers on the road. It kind of also reminds me of the Pensacola Beach bridge. It\\u2019s a bit dangerous because of the speed and height, and there are only minimal guy wires on either side with a lot of strong wind. We barely stay on the road. We are trying to escape something. In another earlier time in the dream, I\\u2019m in a cozy house. I\\u2019m giving a healing session to a contemporary dancer. Her body is very slight but strong. As I begin working on her, she\\u2019s lying next to the fireplace on a folded blanket. Her body moves a lot and she leaps off onto a yoga mat. Then at one point her physical body is kneeling next to mine and we are both working together on her energetic body. The yoga mat leaps away as if her energy body is full of electricity and vitality. We look at each other and laugh with joy at the power of life. As we finish up, she asks for the time. It\\u2019s 9pm and it\\u2019s time for her to go to rehearsal. She gets up and leaves quickly. I follow her out because I need to go somewhere. She goes into the house next door. I\\u2019m surprised because I thought it was empty - the family living there just recently moved to a bigger, nicer house. Maybe she\\u2019s renting it while it\\u2019s waiting to sell. The house next door to that one is owned by a family with a few kids. They\\u2019re getting into their van. I see my son running past their house on the sidewalk and to the corner intersection. I\\u2019m running after him so he doesn\\u2019t run into the road. Everyone in the family has a long carrot tied to their noses and they look like Pinnochio noses. I think it\\u2019s odd, but just yell hello to them as I run after my son who is wild and excited. Then in an earlier part of the dream, I\\u2019m on a college campus. Liam is part of this mission. We\\u2019re tracking a woman who disappeared a long time ago. We\\u2019ve tracked her down into a basement. We go down and people haven\\u2019t been here for a long time, but there are a lot of cats roaming around. I see a movement in the corner and it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s a young woman with brown skin and she\\u2019s only wearing a bikini bottom. She\\u2019s forgotten how to be human. She\\u2019s moving and making sounds like a cat. In order to get close to her, I remove my clothes, all except my bra top and I move around like a cat, too. I\\u2019m speaking to her, cat to cat. She begins to come out but then gets frightened and returns to the shadows. This happens for a while. I\\u2019m conscious of Liam watching me move. I have to move quickly and sensuously to appear like a cat and to avoid all the fallen dusty and broken objects that have been here for ages. We finally catch her and bring her upstairs to the light and human world. Now I need to meet up with friends. I\\u2019m on a motorcycle and driving down a dirt trail. Then I realize I\\u2019m lost and it\\u2019s getting dark. I can hardly see the path and I\\u2019m getting worried. The motorcycle turns into a bicycle. I\\u2019m trying to ride on these dirt paths and am frightened because I\\u2019m lost and it\\u2019s dark and I\\u2019m far out in the woods. Somehow I turn around and find my way back. I leave the bike at the base of some stairs and walk into the lobby of a large building. Friends from my current hometown are all gathered and seem to be waiting for me. Everyone inside has a mask and they are looking at me with scorn because I\\u2019m breaking the rules. I try to pull my scarf up over my face and I see other people pulling their shirts over their faces so they can quickly pass through the building and get to the other side. I join my friends and we circle up to prepare for our trip. We\\u2019re looking forward to being away from here and able to gather without our masks on.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a big theater, like where they host the Grammys. Every seat is occupied. I\\u2019m sitting near the front at the far left with a small group of people, including JP Spears the comedian with a YouTube channel who has swung pretty disturbingly really far left, borderline Q. I don't\\u2019 recognize anyone else in my group from waking life. He\\u2019s put together a routine for us to perform with him. I\\u2019m his assistant. He is telling me about the routine where he\\u2019ll make someone float and make them appear to be him. The person he points out is a young girl with long red hair like him. She is unconscious or asleep. We go up the stairs to the stage and he places her on a table. He tosses a blue blanket over her naked body. I\\u2019m concerned for her modesty and adjust the blanket as he begins the show. He begins the act and somehow he raises her from the table so she\\u2019s floating in the air. This is supposed to be the peak of the performance. There was another part where he made other images of himself, one where he is an older version of himself with a bulbous nose and greying hair. At the end of the routine there isn\\u2019t a lot of applause and we all return to our seats. Other presentations continue on the stage. JP Spears is now lying across the top of the seats in front of me. There is a guy sitting to my right who was somewhat attractive. It looks and sounds like they are masturbating each other. They are breathing heavily. It\\u2019s disturbing and disgusting. I lean in a bit to see if they\\u2019re actually doing what I think they\\u2019re doing. JP Spears cums in my face and I\\u2019m utterly disgusted now. It gets in my eye and mouth. I get up and leave right away. I\\u2019m deciding what to do and where to go now. I don\\u2019t know who to report them to, or if I should. I\\u2019m outside the theatre. It\\u2019s dark and raining. I\\u2019m trying to find a car to get back home. I don\\u2019t have a home here in this place. So I\\u2019m trying to figure out where to go. Later in the dream I am in a house that I\\u2019m sharing with my sister and a woman from my current hometown - she and I do the same kind of work, and we\\u2019re sharing a room. My sister has her own room. I can\\u2019t fall asleep so I get up and wander around the house. The house is a mess with partially unpacked boxes and piles of clothes everywhere. I feel bad about this chaos and how sloppy I am. I just don\\u2019t have the energy to put the house in order and it\\u2019s also nighttime. She is awake reading, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a good idea to make a bunch of noise trying to clean up. I walk past the kitchen and my parents walk in through the door. They are returning early from a trip to the Big Island. They had plans to go on island tours and enjoy the island. They were at dinner and a Senator approached them and told them it was pleasant to see them, but with COVID still actively spreading, they should go home. This is not the time for vacationing. They tell me they were able to catch an early flight. My mom has brought my sister and me some new clothes and jewelry. She has laid out an outfit on the ground - a Christmas sweater that lights up and belonged to my grandmother, jeggings and a gold necklace. My dad has set out guacamole and tortillas for a midnight snack. I eat it and feel better. I get a call from Edward to prepare for a Zoom meeting with a woman who has been working with us. He wants me to find the contract so he can graciously thank her for her help, knowing exactly when she started working with us. I am looking through emails to find the contract but am not sure if that was the exact start date. The first email introduction was sent on October 24. We get on Zoom and she\\u2019s calling in from a kids pool. She\\u2019s on a playdate with her grandchildren and some others. She has her feet in the water with them and they\\u2019re all having a wonderful time splashing and playing on the slides.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, everybody is stuck repeating their same dream over and over and over again. This is the thirteenth night. We\\u2019re all having our own dreams, but they overlap in places where we have encounters with each other. The main place where my dream overlaps and encounters others\\u2019 is at a really small airport. The main person, the dream is interacting with is Rose and people from her dreams. Each time this interaction of dreams happens, there is an opportunity to figure out why the repetition is happening. Between the two of us, we have a chance to interrupt the continued repetitions and be free. This time around, Rose shows up while I\\u2019m waiting in line for my ticket. She\\u2019s wearing fitness clothes for pole dancing - little shorts and a tank top. She has a workout bag full of clothes and toiletries. She\\u2019s waiting for a plane, but so far in all the dreams the plane has never come. I\\u2019m in this airport also waiting for a plane or maybe a train. It's dingy in here and there aren\\u2019t any windows. There\\u2019s a round table that reminds me of the ones at my high school cafeteria. There is stale coffee in styrofoam cups and the wooden sticks to stir in fake sure and half and half, but no food. We\\u2019re all waiting in line for our tickets then going back to the table to wait more. One of the owners of the pole dancing studio shows up with her husband. She\\u2019s wearing a grey sweatsuit, but still looks sexy with her hair and makeup done just right. I feel self conscious and awkward because I recognize her but am not sure if she recognizes me or if she does, if she remembers my name. This happens to me in waking life because I have a good memory for people\\u2019s faces and names, but there are people who I must introduce myself to time and time again because they seem to have no memory of me. She and Rose and a few others are sitting together at one of the tables. It\\u2019s grimy because it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned well in a long time. There\\u2019s trash on the floor and the trashcan nearby is overflowing. Rose gets up and goes to the bathroom to change. She comes out in a black tank top, black pole dancing shorts and black heels. She\\u2019s extra tall. I\\u2019m walking next to her and feel short and frumpy because she is over six feet in her heels and lean, where I am short and deconditioned. We walk to a shower room that\\u2019s like a truck stop shower. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cViviane, we\\u2019ve gotta figure out how to get out of here. Tell me what this dream sequence means.\\u201d She thinks that if we can find out what it means, we will be free. I can\\u2019t recall what happens, though I know we are discussing the dreams.\"],[\"I was heading in to teach several thousand people. There\\u2019s this huge room and all these people are piling in and it was almost an anxiety dream about teaching.\"],[\"At one point I was with my daughter and there\\u2019s this boy who is 16 and he liked me but I don\\u2019t know if I was my age.\"],[\"I remember my friend Sierra was in the dream and we were traveling all over the world.

I was overhearing what they were saying and then I was telling them that I could hear what they were saying. The girl got weird and strange.\"],[\"I was with my ex and he was flirting and being inappropriate. We weren\\u2019t even divorced yet so we were still together. I was so upset that he would be so rude to me and disrespect (honestly this was the energy throughout our marriage - not just the inappropriate stuff but the way he would always do what was best for him and wasn\\u2019t really good at relationship and partnership).\"],[\"We had a kitten - this really cute kitten that was so small. I was keeping my eye out for it and at a certain point it got locked in the closet with Annette\\u2019s two cats who are really big and they hiss a lot at my cats. I was like, \\u201coh no!\\u201d and I went in and grabbed her and her cats ran out and I was making sure she hadn\\u2019t been attacked, but she looked okay. I was checking her for flees because we literally just got her off the street and saved her. She was just this small cute little kitten. At some point, my ex was in the dream and I was helping him get an apartment and trying to get him to film regular classes.\"],[\"I was at a castle/hotel, but it was in the rock - it reminded me of something from Lord of the Rings. It was a great grand palace and Tamar managed it. I was there with Carrie. We were checking it out and Sabrina was having a gathering. A big group was coming and there were a lot of famous people, celebrities and musicians. I wasn\\u2019t invited, but I was just checking out the place. I had my crystal with me. We go into the temple space and I see crystals inside the walls. One of them matches mine and looks just like mine. I put my crystal up to it to see. Then we needed to go, so we left, but I realized I left my crystal. But I think it was taken. So we go back to find my crystal and we see that Sabrina has it and she\\u2019s doing something with it to take the power and energy out of it. I send Carrie to go get it because I don\\u2019t want Sabrina to see me. But I can see through Carrie\\u2019s eyes or something. I can see what\\u2019s happening. So when Carrie sees it, she gets really upset and she goes to try and get the crystal. But she doesn\\u2019t have enough power to battle Sabrina. So I step into Carrie and Sekhmet\\u2019s in me. I essentially battle Sabrina. to get my crystal back. I am just as powerful as Sabrina, if not more powerful. I can match her power but not in a dark way. The whole time, Carrie thinks she\\u2019s the one who's battling, and Sabrina does, too. They don\\u2019t know that my power went into Carrie. Sabrina is shocked that it\\u2019s Carrie. I don\\u2019t know if I get my crystal back.\"],[\"I had a dream that someone came to clean my sink. They opened up the sink and it went down, down, down - all the way down like 1 or 2 stories. I was like, \\u201cHow is the sink filling if it\\u2019s that low down there?\\u201d He had a spiral thing and got all the hair and gunk out. Then he made it crystal clean and perfect. He put the stuff back.\"],[\"There\\u2019s Hawaiian boys, Chance and Shane, they are charming, good looking guys, younger. Annette and I were hiring them to help us move and we were paying them. I thought they were really sweet. After they moved everything, we realized they stole from us. I can\\u2019t remember what they stole, but they did. So we found them and got it back and accused them. They were so sorry. We felt bad for them. So we let them work for us again. This time they stole even more - thousands and thousands worth of stuff.\"],[\"Somebody is upset because he knew a group of people who lived where they just installed and activated 5G and they lost their ability to feel emotion.\"],[\"At one point, I was in a group with Bernard and Marie was there. I can\\u2019t remember the specifics. In another scene, I see a huge tidal wave - 100 feet and right there I have my daughter with me and I grab her hand and say, \\u201cCome with me!\\u201d I pull her into this giant building that we just happened to be walking by - a really tall, huge building. I pul us in and lose the door and it secures. We just make it as this wave goes by. I notice when we\\u2019re in there that there are no windows and I guess this is why we were safe. It may have been a gymnasium, all concrete with no windows and huge. I\\u2019m not sure if anyone else was in there. It\\u2019s possible there were a few others, though. It was definitely not a full building. I feel like when I pulled her in, I ran her up some stairs so we could go up a few levels, but it\\u2019s vague. We are in the right place at the right time for having just walked by this building when this tidal wave was coming. If we were anywhere else we would have been caught in it. Towards the end I\\u2019m like, okay, when we walk out, everybody will have died. There\\u2019s no way anyone survived that. We hadn\\u2019t gone back out yet, I was just bracing myself for going out to see what happened.\"],[\"I woke up to a woman singing. She was Asian. She had an amazing voice with fantastic range.

I was giving a reading to Mystic Mamma. I find it striking that they are both MM, and for me, MM is Mary Magdalene.\"],[\"I had a bunch of dreams. I had a dream of a guy I know from years ago. He was there and I saw something with our names on it. I asked someone, \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d It turns out he has really been into me this whole time and I was totally baffled since he acted so weird in real life. In another dream, I bought my mom a beautiful peacock necklace. But it was too expensive so I bought it for her. I also bought an expensive new pair of jeans. Then I was in some swimming pool place where they had classes for kids. The classes were listed. They were normal classes. Then all of a sudden I see one listed that said, \\u201cJungian Archetypes\\u201d and thought that was a random class to have for children at a pool. Then there was an image of a cow having a baby calf. Then at a certain point I was on a toilet with a magazine telling somebody to please leave. Then there was a giant water sprayer.\"],[\"In my dream there were all these boxes with glass starts in them. They were the stars in the sky. They were all put into nice boxes to protect them and keep them safe. One of them was Sirius and Sirius is my star. This guy opened the box up and didn\\u2019t package it back up and then started stacking other boxes on top of it. I was like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d and I pulled them off. And I said, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that! You could break it!\\u201d He was just being a jerk. I moved it, but then he did it again and was being an asshole. I was just trying to protect the star because I didn\\u2019t want it to get crushed. It was made of glass and could\\u2019ve been harmed with heavy things put on it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the ocean. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing there. I see a huge tidal wave coming. There is no way to get away from it because I\\u2019m in the ocean. It\\u2019s coming quickly. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh great, this is it, I guess I\\u2019m going to die.\\u201d The wave came and it took me under. I expected it to toss me around and I figured I was going to whack on the rocks. But I didn\\u2019t. I was just suspended. Then I came back out of it and was fine. I was like, \\u201cHuh. But where is my daughter?\\u201d I don\\u2019t think she was with me at first, but I knew she was there on the beach or something. So I\\u2019m looking for my daughter and I can\\u2019t find her. I\\u2019m freaking out. I\\u2019m running around and sobbing and calling for her. I see some teachers from her old school and they don\\u2019t look all that concerned. I ask, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter? Where\\u2019s my daughter?!\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don't know.\\u201d Then I see one of my daughter\\u2019s friend\\u2019s mom. I ask her and she doesn\\u2019t know. Nobody is freaking out. But my daughter is missing and there was just a tidal wave. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d and I\\u2019m so upset. I finally find her, but I can\\u2019t remember where. Her friend is still missing, so I\\u2019m trying to find her friend.

I could see it and he could see it, but most other people couldn\\u2019t. So we were talking in code to each other about whatever this was. I don\\u2019t know what it was. At a certain point I said to him, \\u201cYou know, Sabrina has gone bad. She went to the dark side.\\u201d He said, \\u201cYeah, I know.\\u201d Then, there was a random connection between my birthday on June 24 and the opposite birthday is December 25, Jesus\\u2019 birthday and many other male god figures. My birthday is also John the Baptist\\u2019s birthday, so it\\u2019s like the dark and the light twin. The dark twin is born on June 24 when the sun stops standing still and starts to descend, and the light twin is born on December 25 as the sun stops standing still and starts to ascend. In the dream, there was something about that opposite birthday and there was someone I needed to find with that birthday, like we were connected in some way.\"],[\"I saw a lot of white and baby blue Porsche Cayennes in a parking lot.

For whatever reason, Annette\\u2019s cats were in a different apartment. We weren\\u2019t living together. I forgot about her cats for a day and a half. I didn\\u2019t feed them, I didn\\u2019t give them more water, I didn\\u2019t scoop their poop. When I did remember, I went in there and they were freaking out. I gave them some food and they were wolfing it down because they were so hungry. When I went to the poop box to check the poop, it was disgusting and there was stuff clumped everywhere. I was scooping it all out, but there was so much in it that I let it go. The amount I was seeing didn\\u2019t make sense because it felt like how much a cat would do in a week, not a day and a half. I felt super bad that I completely forgot about her cats.\"],[\"I had a dream of Arawn but cannot remember the details.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to get two cats that I had dropped off. But when we get them, they\\u2019re adolescent tigers. They\\u2019re nuzzling each other. We\\u2019re petting them and they\\u2019re playful. I\\u2019m surprised that they\\u2019re tigers now. Then I see our old dog who we rehomed years ago because he needed a different situation, but then he ended up dying. He\\u2019s old and blind and bleeding. I grab him to rehabilitate him.

I\\u2019m backtracking and looking for a nice place to stay with a view that looks like Bali.\"],[\"I saw a big pink church, a school on a hill.

We were going along a flat bottom and up these metal stairs up to a door that led into the check in area of a hotel. In the basement was a black panther mother and a black panther child and another big cat that I couldn\\u2019t see but knew was there. We were trying to get through and up and out. We were concerned about these predator cats. They didn\\u2019t chase us, but we were running up the stairs and freaking out. There was a code on the door and I was like, \\u201cOh god, I hope I know the code.\\u201d I knew it, which was totally random. We got into the center of the hotel and I was telling the manager about the predator cats in the basement.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of \\u201chouse,\\u201d but I can\\u2019t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we\\u2019re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can\\u2019t live on Gaia anymore and it\\u2019s not worth the effort to try to save her. She\\u2019s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.\"],[\"There are just snippets of this dream that came through. I\\u2019m in the kitchen of my childhood home trying to put dishes away and reorganize the cabinet. My sister\\u2019s there with me. She\\u2019s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she\\u2019s always playing the victim. Then I\\u2019m in a house - it\\u2019s close by my childhood home. There\\u2019s a man living in it who\\u2019s apparently my significant other, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There\\u2019s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he\\u2019s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I\\u2019m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I\\u2019m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There\\u2019s an opera house. It\\u2019s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I\\u2019m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I\\u2019m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There\\u2019s all kinds of magical things in them. It\\u2019s dark up in here and I\\u2019m looking through them. Then I decide it\\u2019s time to leave. Now I\\u2019m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I\\u2019m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There\\u2019s so much snow and I\\u2019m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I\\u2019m driving down, there\\u2019s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn\\u2019t I stop to let them go by, don\\u2019t I know that pedestrians have the right of way. I look at them and I look ahead of me where there\\u2019s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It\\u2019s a small street, I\\u2019m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I am in a school, parts of it look like my old high school and the people I\\u2019m with feel like my old classmates. I\\u2019m teaching and it feels like what I\\u2019m teaching is very basic - it\\u2019s stuff that most people already know, although my classmates don\\u2019t seem to know it. I leave the classroom that I\\u2019m in and head outside. There\\u2019s a bunch of kids - they\\u2019re younger than me and they\\u2019re not particularly friendly. It\\u2019s definitely a clique and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re showing off and I don\\u2019t really feel welcome, so I leave and head to this classroom where another young woman is teaching and I love what she\\u2019s teaching. It\\u2019s all new and I\\u2019ve never run into it before, but it makes perfect sense and it\\u2019s a type of sociology about the way humans interact and how we communicate and can have adult mature conversations. The kids in this clique are in there, kind of, but they\\u2019re acting like they\\u2019ve heard all of it even though it\\u2019s all new to me. I\\u2019m just noticing the difference between my classmates who I was teaching who are older and these younger kids who seem to already know a lot and are very aloof. I sit down and have a conversation with the teacher who is maybe a little bit younger than me but not by much. She tells me about this raincoat or jacket (I forget the name she called it), but she\\u2019s showing me this things she\\u2019s wearing and it looks like a snakeskin where she cut a slit through the side of the body and can fit her head into when she puts it on it actually expands out and her arms go - one side goes down into the tail and the other side goes down into the head and expands and lifts up and out. It covers her like a cape, but when she takes it off it goes back into its snakeskin size and she just curls it up and puts it in her bag. I\\u2019m totally fascinated and she very much loves it and likes talking about it. She says it\\u2019s a lot like the capes that the Scots used to wear. I don\\u2019t know what that means. I take her word for it. And then it\\u2019s time for us to leave this classroom. We\\u2019re going to a competition of sorts. She and these standoffish kids and me and some of my friends who are going to be performing, we get in the back of a truck/wagon and we\\u2019re on our way. The standoffish kids are down at the bottom and even though it\\u2019s a celebration, they are not drinking any alcohol. The friends around me, they have all of their instruments and supplies, and they keep talking about the alcohol they\\u2019re going to drink, and I don\\u2019t want to. I think, no, we don\\u2019t want to drink, it makes us poor players, it makes us so we can\\u2019t compete very well. We won\\u2019t win. One of them starts to pass around a bottle of champagne and I say I don\\u2019t want it. I stick a cork in it, but the cork won\\u2019t stay - the fizzies keep popping it off. Somebody else comes in and says, \\u201coh there\\u2019s a way to make a cork that will stay but you have to know the magic.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t seem to know it. I don\\u2019t like it anyway. I just keep thinking that if they start drinking, we won\\u2019t be able to compete and those other kids will win the competition. It seems so off to me that alcohol is still available anyway. We arrive at the carnival/festival/competition place we were heading to. There\\u2019s a big outdoor tent. It\\u2019s kind of dark and gloomy throughout this whole dream - not a lot of sunshine. The younger kids go off and set up their project or their music or whatever it is. Me and my companions also set up our space. What I notice is there\\u2019s not a lot of help getting it set up. I can tell I\\u2019m doing a lot of work. We have some sort of booth and people are coming by. We are explaining to the judges what our booth represents - what all the things we\\u2019ve set up are for. There\\u2019s this feeling that is not quite up to snuff or up to par - it\\u2019s not what\\u2019s needed right now. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re showing or doing is 2 or 3 steps behind whatever those kids are setting up or doing - just like in the school where they seemed 2 or 3 steps ahead in their courses already even though I was a teacher that was teaching to my peers. The fair thing is over now and it\\u2019s time to clean up and clear off the table. All of my friends leave and leave me to do the cleaning up for myself. I\\u2019m distraught because I\\u2019m supposed to go with those younger kids wherever they\\u2019re going. That teacher is with them and she\\u2019s beckoning me to come with, but I don\\u2019t go because if I don\\u2019t clean up, nobody else will and I\\u2019m the only one who knows where everything goes anyway.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a condo - it\\u2019s huge. There\\u2019s a huge kitchen. The living room is gigantic. The bathroom has two separate showers. There\\u2019s a balcony that I walk out onto and can see the ocean from it. I live in this condo with my kids. They\\u2019re not here with me right now, but I feel comfortable here. All of my stuff is in the condo. Now my ex is here with me and we\\u2019re being cordial with each other. He\\u2019s actually even really friendly and seems happy to see me. I notice he has some of his stuff with him and it bothers me that he\\u2019s brought it and put it into the condo. This condo is one that I received in the divorce and yet somehow he is able to buy it and take it for himself. I\\u2019m not clear on why he\\u2019s even there, except that all of a sudden, I can feel that his energy is moving into this place with me. I decide to go take a shower and he decides he\\u2019ll go take a shower, too. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near me and I don\\u2019t want him to see me naked. I go to take a shower and his desk and other office stuff is in the shower stall so I can\\u2019t get in. I\\u2019m really mad because I did not say okay - I did not say it was alright for him to move his stuff in there and to be in this place. I\\u2019m starting to get agitated and his demeanor is changing from one of kindness and being happy to see me to really domineering. I ask him to take his stuff out of the shower, but it\\u2019s taking him forever, so I just decide not to and I leave. Then I say, \\u201cYou know we have to have the conversation because this isn\\u2019t what I want and this isn\\u2019t true and this isn\\u2019t going to last. Now he gets really shut down. We actually walk out of the condo into a lobby type area that\\u2019s part of the complex. There\\u2019s a huge Christmas tree in the lobby area. We can see out to the ocean from where we\\u2019re standing. I tell him I don\\u2019t want him living with me or in my space and that he needs to leave. But he tells me that he owns the condo and it is his now and that I can\\u2019t stay there. We go back up to the condo and I\\u2019m racking my brain because I don\\u2019t have any place to go. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to go and I don\\u2019t have any money. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to live where the kids can be with me. I start to pack up all my stuff and as I\\u2019m doing so, his girlfriend comes in. We sit down at the table in the kitchen. It\\u2019s an oval table with a couple of leaves in it. The chairs don\\u2019t match. In fact one of the chairs is a lot shorter. It kind of makes me laugh, but I don\\u2019t sit in that one. He tells me that he now owns the condo, that it\\u2019s his place and he\\u2019s going to share it with the girlfriend. I ask him how much he pays every month and he says they split the $5,000 monthly mortgage. I know that is not something I can pay. I see that the kids - her kids and our kids - are there and they\\u2019re running around. They\\u2019re happy to be in this space. I know I\\u2019m not going to live there with them. So I gather as much of my things as I can and I leave. I don\\u2019t know exactly what I\\u2019m going to do. I know the kids are okay for now, so that\\u2019s alright. As I walk out the front door, he walks with me and he\\u2019s essentially escorting me out and off the properties. We\\u2019re walking through this neighborhood that looks really familiar and I realize I\\u2019ve been in this neighborhood before. Down at the end of the neighborhood is a crystal mine. I\\u2019ve been to this crystal mine before and I can\\u2019t remember when or why, I just remember there\\u2019s crystals there. We walk by a house whose roof is being replaced. The woman who owns the house is on top of it and the roof is being replaced with large large tumbled crystals. They are huge stones and she\\u2019s sliding them into these lanes that fit on top of her roof. She\\u2019s about an eighth of the way done. I watch as she climbs down the ladder. She has these special shoes on and walks out to the crystal mine. My ex and I are still walking and we start to follow her. But I want him to leave because there\\u2019s no reason for him to be near me. Then the scene shifts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my ex again (this is the second night in a row). There is tension between the two of us. He says he\\u2019s moving and wants to take some of the furniture. We\\u2019re standing in the kid\\u2019s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it\\u2019s very dark in there. I see that there\\u2019s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don\\u2019t care if he takes them. There\\u2019s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I\\u2019m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I\\u2019m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I\\u2019m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I\\u2019m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I\\u2019m still a mother. I still have two children. They\\u2019re still with me. And my godmother says let\\u2019s just go. All of a sudden we\\u2019re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I\\u2019m starting to get upset because I realize we didn\\u2019t pack anything. There\\u2019s no food. There\\u2019s no water. I don\\u2019t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don\\u2019t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I\\u2019m sure. I say, \\u201cyes, we don\\u2019t have any of the things we need.\\u201d She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there\\u2019s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we\\u2019re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we\\u2019re heading back the other way. We\\u2019re all fine, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, \\u201c well, we\\u2019re going to take a shortcut.\\u201d And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He\\u2019s young - he\\u2019s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He\\u2019s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There\\u2019s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there\\u2019s display cases and a buffet table. I\\u2019m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don\\u2019t because I\\u2019m allergic to rice and I\\u2019m allergic to soy and I can\\u2019t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I\\u2019m heartbroken because number one, I\\u2019m starving, and number two, I haven\\u2019t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. There\\u2019s a building that looks kind of like a town hall you\\u2019d rent for a function, but it\\u2019s a bit grander than that. The patio area has these huge columns like the Roman columns you see in ruins. It\\u2019s night time. It\\u2019s dark out. There\\u2019s a lot of people I don\\u2019t know at the party, but there\\u2019s a lot of my classmates from high school there, too. We\\u2019re hanging out but I have this feeling of being the outsider and not really welcomed or not included somehow. I\\u2019m watching what\\u2019s going on and I\\u2019m trying to get the attention of my classmates but I\\u2019m awkward about it and I don\\u2019t really know how. Then one of my classmates who I\\u2019ve known since we were 8 sees me and hangs out together and kinda takes me under his wing. He\\u2019s showing me around this party - just the outside perimeter part, we still haven\\u2019t gone into any of the building. He\\u2019s getting really comfortable with me. His arm is around me and there\\u2019s this air of ownership almost. I do not like it. I remember when we were in high school and flashing back to when he was a little more touchy feely than I liked. I\\u2019m not excited that he\\u2019s doing that, but I also wanted to see everyone. Eventually I peel myself away. Then some sort of time goes by and I\\u2019m walking around this party and I realize there\\u2019s this point on one side where it was the outside of the party and there\\u2019s grass fields and trees. Time is going on normally. But there\\u2019s a partition and on the other side of this line, everything has been frozen. The people there are asleep. I realize that if I cross over this line and walk into it, I can see them, I can see that they\\u2019re asleep or frozen and I can also bring them out of it. When I do, six years has passed on one side of the line and no time has passed on their side. It\\u2019s very odd. They\\u2019re still who they were and time has gone on on the other side. The dreams shifts completely and my two children are with me. We are walking down to the beach. We walk down this path and on either side of the path are noni bushes - bushes I grew up with in Hawaii. As soon as I come out of the path onto the walkway that skirts the edge of the beach, a lifeguard greets me and says, \\u201chello, good morning, welcome.\\u201d I look up and it\\u2019s my ex boyfriend who used to be a lifeguard. I\\u2019m so surprised that he was so friendly to me. I say, \\u201chello.\\u201d He sees who it is and the friendliness disappears immediately. He says something nasty. I ask him if he\\u2019s still going to be mean to me and if he\\u2019s still mad at me. He says essentially yes forever. That hurt my feelings a little bit but I realized there wasn\\u2019t much I could do about that. He couldn\\u2019t keep me off the beach with the kids and we keep going. I see to my left a huge pool - an outdoor pool. Some of those same friends from the party are in the pool and I feel like I\\u2019ve been looking for them. I head their direction and the kids are with me, but again I feel this weird outsider feeling like I wasn\\u2019t quite invited and I\\u2019m going to be the weird kid that shows up at the party even though they weren\\u2019t invited. But I walk towards the pool anyway and both the kids get in the pool because they\\u2019re really excited to swim. I\\u2019m staying on the edge and all those classmates are ignoring me. But then they start playing with my son and teaching him how to jump in the pool. They continue to ignore me even though they can very clearly see me. My daughter is not excited about this either. She can see that there\\u2019s this outsider vibe going and she\\u2019s backing off and away, too. I\\u2019m trying to keep an eye on her and an eye on my son. Then we get out of the pool and begin to walk away. The awkwardness just gets to be too much. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I have a mentoring meeting with one of my clients. I\\u2019ve ridden my bike to her place and park it in the garage. She meets me there. We\\u2019re talking about whatever it is she needs to talk about it. We go upstairs into her apartment and we have our session. She\\u2019s talking about actually having another baby with her partner, which is a big deal because it would have to be in vitro fertilization. She already has another child who is a little bit older. At a certain point she has to go pick them up, so we end our session after talking. She goes into her bedroom and grabs another child - a younger child, a little black orphan baby that she has adopted. It was not an infant, maybe 3 or 4 or 5, had been sleeping in the bedroom the whole time and I didn\\u2019t know. She puts the child in a front carrier, straps in, and heads out. We\\u2019re both heading out back down the stairs from her apartment to her garage where my bike is and her car is. I\\u2019m just surprised that there was another child in the apartment the whole time and apparently sleeping, but it didn\\u2019t come up in our conversation either. I thought it was so strange. She goes out. She leaves with her other child to pick up her child from school. I get my bike and start riding it down the street because I\\u2019m heading towards an Imbolc festival. As I\\u2019m riding my bike, I get off and walk. I\\u2019m walking down the main street that I grew up on in my childhood. I\\u2019m seeing the mountains to my right - they\\u2019re beautiful, covered in green grass and I can see the tree line. Then of course I can see all of the houses - the regular neighborhoods that I passed every day in my childhood. I\\u2019m heading down to the high school I went to as I was growing up and that is where the festival is. So I cross the little bridge that has a stream under it and I take a right into the school and I make it right past the cattle gate into the main entrance and set my bike down. I also have this strange lingering feeling that I have my own children I\\u2019m supposed to be watching. They show up at the school and I take them in and bring them through the entrance where I pay for admission. My old mentor who I learned some of my priestessing skills in my priestess apprenticeship is there. She is there to take us all on a guided journey before I get into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s me and whoever else has shown up at the entrance of the gate, which I find interesting because she\\u2019s only taking the people who have been trained as priestesses to go do this meditation, and two of the other women that I see there - besides the women I went through the program with - are actually high school classmates of mine who tell me, \\u201cOh yeah, we started this program five years ago. We\\u2019ve always been priestesses.\\u201d I\\u2019m really shocked because I didn\\u2019t see them the entire time I was on the program and also I feel a little bit betrayed, like I had been told that the group of us that had been going through the program was it and to find out there were other people that we didn\\u2019t know about in our spiral is very disturbing to me. We lay down anyway and we\\u2019re going through this meditation. I can hear my mentor\\u2019s voice and she says very specific words, which I cannot remember now. But there\\u2019s also a part where she sprinkles turmeric and saffron over us - those are the two herbs we are meant to be using with this meditation. And then I can feel my body taking in the herbs, taking in the words - there\\u2019s definitely a change in what feels like my consciousness and my field. When it\\u2019s done, I get up and I know it\\u2019s time for me to leave. I\\u2019m not supposed to stay there with the other priestesses or the people she had brought in to do this blessing. I head into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s interesting, I can see yellow tulips everywhere. These tulips seem to be playing an important part of this Imbolc festival. Then I leave because I\\u2019m still so upset about these two women who were my high school classmates who also suddenly turned out to be these priestesses that I didn\\u2019t know that they were. They have some disdain and contempt for me because I had left the path early and I don\\u2019t like any of it. So I leave the festival and somehow the scene changes completely. I\\u2019m in a home with my mom and my dad and my dad is trying to keep the inside of the house - I think it was supposed to be my childhood home - he\\u2019s trying to keep it in order, keep it clean. My mom is in another section of the house - her office - and there\\u2019s her and a bunch of people in it and they\\u2019re all brainstorming jobs - how to work, how to make money. They\\u2019re making the assumption that I\\u2019m part of it, I\\u2019m going to start working it. But I\\u2019m actually in the office trying to brainstorm my own programs, my own classes, my own way to get more clients. They keep including me in their discussion and finally I get really pissed off and start yelling. I grab their papers they\\u2019ve been writing on and tear them up, rip them up. They finally say oh, okay, she\\u2019s not going to help with that and they go back to writing on their whiteboards brainstorming. I\\u2019m so annoyed that I get up and head out to a restaurant that they apparently also own. I can\\u2019t tell if both my parents own it or just one, but I go to the restaurant and there\\u2019s this pressure on me to help work in that restaurant too and I do not want to, but I do need money. So I go into the restaurant and it\\u2019s interesting because a different classmate is a server in the restaurant and there\\u2019s another man - two men are in there. They sit me down and they walk me through the way this restaurant works and how the emphasis is on kindness to the employees, which is so different from the restaurant experience I have where everyone is cutthroat and the chefs brandish knives at you and whatnot. So they are explaining to me how the restaurant works and how my duties would be as manager and how little I would have to do. I\\u2019m still not sold, I don\\u2019t want to work at a restaurant, I\\u2019ve already done that. While we\\u2019re sitting down at the meeting, people are coming into the restaurant and eating. Things are flowing. I can hear glasses clinking and silverware being used and orders being yelled out and lots of conversation. I look to my right and there\\u2019s this huge square table with 12 people sitting at it and they\\u2019re singing to a cat trying to communicate to the cat to do something. The cat is actually responding to it - it reminds me of snake charmers and all of these students know exactly what they\\u2019re doing. They\\u2019re communicating to this cat through singing, all 12 of them, and they are getting the cat to do what they want it to do and I\\u2019m just fascinated watching this happen. Then my attention goes back to the two guys I\\u2019m in the meeting with and I just tell them, \\u201cit\\u2019s lovely, you\\u2019re lovely, the restaurant seems lovely. The restaurant seems to run quite well, but I\\u2019m not interested. I don\\u2019t want to work in a restaurant.\\u201d Then the scene changes again, but I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest of the dream.\"],[\"So many different dreams. I just remember fragments. The first one is just me and a priestess sister and some other people I know. We\\u2019re going on a journey. We have a covered wagon that we\\u2019re getting ready to travel with. It\\u2019s a long journey and rather perilous on the one hand, and on the other hand, there\\u2019s still modern things available to us. In the dream I go through the whole journey but I can only remember the ending part where we have gone everywhere we need to go and are sitting at a kitchen table trying to weigh out sliced oranges and green beans to feed another child and the scale won\\u2019t work. One of my priestess sisters is on a couch behind me and she\\u2019s getting scolded by someone for saying that she wants to do a certain thing but then not doing it. She kept saying that she wanted to wear bright orange and red colors, but she doesn\\u2019t do it. In the dream, I feel like it is a metaphor for her expressing some part of herself or turning on some part of her magic that she knows she wants but she just doesn\\u2019t. I\\u2019m listening to the whole thing in a kitchen - it\\u2019s a kitchen that\\u2019s been part of the journey. I\\u2019m worrying that the person that\\u2019s scolding her is going to come scold me. The person scolding her sounds like James Earl Jones, he\\u2019s like a big black man with a lot of gravitas and authority and power. I\\u2019m nervous he\\u2019s going to come over and start telling me what I'm not doing right. Then the scene changes. We\\u2019re back on the covered wagon again and heading home, back to where we started from. We get there and there\\u2019s a huge barn (it reminds me of a barn raising, but the barn has already been built). Everyone\\u2019s getting ready to dance. It\\u2019s a weird mix of olden times where the women are wearing white caps on their heads and have these long full skirts and then some of them aren\\u2019t - some of them are dressed in club clothes, like they are going to a rave. Some of the participants I know from when I did Olympic weight lifting at my old gym. It\\u2019s a very strange mix of people. I\\u2019m still watching all of it. People are saying hello and welcome back from your journey, but there\\u2019s a part of me that\\u2019s very much the observer and not in the celebrations that are happening. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a wedding or just a party. There\\u2019s something going on. This fragment ends and the next fragment I remember is: a man is calling me on my phone. I had had a healing from him the night before. He calls me and says, \\u201cHello, this is Michael. Your healing was very interesting today. I put together a video for you to watch of what I healed.\\u201d But his connection is crappy and the video keeps freezing and I don\\u2019t get to see all the pieces. He recognizes this and says, \\u201cOh, I can see that the video won\\u2019t play. Let me just tell you.\\u201d Then he tells me, but of course now I can\\u2019t remember what he said! He had done the healing and things had come up and I was very surprised that he called me because I was supposed to call him. He was trying to emphasize that the healing was very significant, very interesting, and that I really needed to know and he wasn\\u2019t going to wait for me to call him. Then the scene switches again and I\\u2019m in another fragment of a dream. This time I\\u2019m riding in a vehicle and I\\u2019m watching a woman in front of me who is biking. She\\u2019s doing a long distance bike because she has big saddlebags and she has her dog with her. Something happens to the dog - she has to feed it or it gets something in its paw - and she has to stop and tend it. It\\u2019s a big black dog with curly hair. She spends a lot of time making sure the dog is okay - I think it is. The surroundings around us are so strange. It\\u2019s like the road is lifted up and elevated. Sometimes it\\u2019s sand on either side, sometimes it\\u2019s water, sometimes there\\u2019s a palm tree. It\\u2019s totally blue skies. It\\u2019s completely clear. It seems like some sort of paradise place, but there\\u2019s not a lot of greenery. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s not part of this realm and it\\u2019s really important for this woman to take care of her dog and it\\u2019s super important for me to witness it and I do not know why.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a dinner party of sorts - it feels like one of those social gatherings like an auction where they raise money for a cause. I\\u2019m sitting at a long table and there\\u2019s a Latino man to my left who is paying me quite a lot of attention, but my attention is focused on another group of people who are not sitting at a table - they are standing up and gathered in a crowd and they\\u2019re huddled somewhat closely together. Some of them are dressed as servers who are working this banquet dinner. Some of them are dressed as guests. The sense I\\u2019m getting is that they have something up their sleeve. They\\u2019re planning to do something and there\\u2019s definitely magic involved. I keep seeing little flashes or vignettes of little scenes where something is a little out of place and the thing that\\u2019s out of place has a red color and everything else in the background is its normal color. I\\u2019m not quite understanding everything I\\u2019m seeing, but I know that each of these little vignettes I see, one thing is going to trigger the next thing and it will be a sequence of events that creates this magic. I don\\u2019t even know what it is - it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s supposed to impact the way this auction dinner is going. This is taking up quite a bit of my attention until the Latino man on my left who has dark short cropped black hair, dark skin and a 5 o\\u2019clock shadow where I can see he has shaved but it\\u2019s not smoothe...He\\u2019s a little older than I am and he has leaned over to get my attention. He\\u2019s leaning over my left shoulder and it feels like his upper body is almost in my lap, but he\\u2019s still being very respectful, it\\u2019s not a pushy way, he just really is trying to get my attention. He says that he will protect me and love me no matter what, which I find a little unnerving because I don\\u2019t know who he is. This scene ends and it cuts away to me driving a car. I\\u2019m driving away from the dinner. I think it\\u2019s the next day because it\\u2019s light out and this was definitely a dinner happening in the evening. I\\u2019m driving to an errand of some sort and I can see that it\\u2019s sunny and it looks like I\\u2019m going the regular path I take to drive my kids to tennis. I\\u2019m on the phone with a girlfriend and I\\u2019m relating this story to her and I\\u2019m relating the behavior of this Latino man who, now that it\\u2019s the next day I feel like he was a kind of wizard of some sort or at least he had great magical power or he had the ability to at least take me out of whatever was going on. So I\\u2019m relating this story of my friend and I\\u2019m asking her what she thinks of it. She\\u2019s telling me that yes it was somewhat strange behavior but I could actually trust this man and I remember thinking, well, trust him or not, I don\\u2019t know why he said he was going to love me. There was no chemical attraction there at all. I just felt baffled by his behavior. But I start to feel strange talking about this on the phone the next day and I know that there is some sort of connection happening and it feels like there\\u2019s an alchemical process happening in my body as I describe it to my friend. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a coffee shop and I see a friend of mine who is working there. I haven\\u2019t seen her for a while. I ask if she wants to hang out but it feels strange. She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it\\u2019s not very big, there\\u2019s not a lot of space. She\\u2019s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I\\u2019m asking her while she\\u2019s busy, and it\\u2019s not that she doesn\\u2019t want to hang out. The scene changes and I\\u2019m in a residential area of a town and I\\u2019m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I\\u2019m walking up a hill and she\\u2019s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I\\u2019m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She\\u2019s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It\\u2019s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don\\u2019t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They\\u2019re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I\\u2019m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It\\u2019s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there\\u2019s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there\\u2019s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I\\u2019m a little bit wary because there\\u2019s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don\\u2019t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don\\u2019t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I\\u2019m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It\\u2019s actually another sort of twilight, but it\\u2019s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it\\u2019s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I\\u2019m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it\\u2019s cordial. Suddenly he\\u2019s talking to me like we\\u2019re still lovers. I\\u2019m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle.\\u201d The voice is also telling me, \\u201cYou can still be kind, you can still be kind.\\u201d So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he\\u2019s going to take me with him. So we\\u2019ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there\\u2019s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It\\u2019s where he lives. He has an apartment. He\\u2019s very very familiar with me and I\\u2019m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He\\u2019s a surfer and he\\u2019s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he\\u2019s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I\\u2019m actually quite glad that he\\u2019s going. So again, I\\u2019m being as encouraging as possible. I\\u2019m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don\\u2019t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I\\u2019m just sending him off for a little bit and then he\\u2019ll be back. But in my mind I\\u2019m sending him off like he\\u2019s going off on a quest and I won't\\u2019 see him for a long while. I\\u2019m relieved that I wont\\u2019 see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he\\u2019s really proud of. I\\u2019m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he\\u2019s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I\\u2019m satisfied with how I\\u2019ve handled all of it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people - I know some of them, they\\u2019re acquaintances that I\\u2019ve met here where I live, but we\\u2019re not close. We\\u2019ve met up and we\\u2019re going to a concert, but it\\u2019s music I don\\u2019t know or I don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not excited about it, but it\\u2019s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There\\u2019s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it\\u2019s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we\\u2019re listening, and I\\u2019m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I\\u2019ve met them before or they\\u2019re from some era of my past. We\\u2019re listening and while we\\u2019re listening there\\u2019s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it\\u2019s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m just sewing away and now it\\u2019s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can\\u2019t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I\\u2019m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don\\u2019t tangle my threads and it\\u2019s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I\\u2019m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I\\u2019ve been in a bowling alley. There\\u2019s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I\\u2019m just watching them bowl and they\\u2019re all having a really good time. It\\u2019s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I\\u2019ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It\\u2019s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it\\u2019s time for me to bowl. It\\u2019s not time because I\\u2019m part of their team or anything; I\\u2019m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I\\u2019m so terrible at it. It\\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. So, I\\u2019m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there\\u2019s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it\\u2019s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can\\u2019t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can\\u2019t go head on or straight. So it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there\\u2019s a person sitting in the way. So it\\u2019s my turn again and I go to him and say, \\u201cCould you please move so I can bowl correctly?\\u201d The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he\\u2019s watching me to see if I\\u2019m going to get it. There\\u2019s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I\\u2019m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it\\u2019s my turn and he\\u2019s not in my way, I go to bowl and it\\u2019s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It\\u2019s the most beautiful bowl you\\u2019ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the room of a house I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m there with, I think my ex, I\\u2019m not sure as the face flickers out. But I\\u2019m looking around and there\\u2019s a table, a desk, with an old stereo on it - it looks exactly like the one I had growing up in high school. It has a case and the case is not on it, so I put the case on like it\\u2019s supposed to be. There\\u2019s also a vase of flowers in the room - I don\\u2019t know if somebody gave them to me, or if they\\u2019re just there. I put them next to the bed on this tall nightstand. This whole time I feel simultaneously trapped and nostalgic. This old radio stereo makes me nostalgic for my childhood and yet I feel trapped in this room and want to get out of it, especially since it looks like my ex is in there with me. Then he says we have to go to dinner. I don\\u2019t want to because we\\u2019re not together and I have no idea why I\\u2019d go to dinner with him. But he says we have to go because we\\u2019re meeting clients of his. Now I\\u2019m really not wanting to because it\\u2019s a gross schmoozy dinner that I do not want to be a part of. He walks out the door and gets on a bike and starts pedaling through a crowd. I\\u2019ve followed him out and am watching him go. I\\u2019m really sad because I know that my legs and the muscles in my body are not as strong as they used to be and it\\u2019s going to be really hard for me to pedal that bike to follow him to this dinner party we\\u2019re going to. I can just feel how I don\\u2019t have very much strength in my legs and I used to have a lot. And it's making me really sad to know that I used to be a very strong bodied person and now I\\u2019m not. I follow him anyway on a bike. I stay behind him the whole way because I can\\u2019t keep up. We\\u2019re biking through crowds of people to get to this restaurant. I\\u2019m following along behind and he parks his bike and so do I. I see him talking to a host at the restaurant and telling him he has a table for four and I\\u2019m to follow. So I follow him to a table, but there\\u2019s enough distance between us that by the time I finally get to the table, he\\u2019s already ordered drinks and he has hor d'oeuvres coming and he\\u2019s on his second drink already. I go to sit down at the table, still very reluctant. There are other people who will join us. He has me try one of his drinks. It\\u2019s alcoholic and super sugary sweet gross, and I don\\u2019t want to taste it because I know alcohol is so bad for me - it will make me feel really badly really quickly and I hate that I\\u2019m here with him. It feels like I\\u2019m being made to perform the dutiful hostess while he performs the gross role of extravagant host. He\\u2019s ordering all the food and our guests are here now. It\\u2019s two different couples, both man and wife, female and male couples. They\\u2019ve sat down and my ex is getting loud and really arrogant and ordering the food for everyone. He\\u2019s ordering tapas for everyone but it has dairy or grain, which is all food I\\u2019m allergic to, so there's nothing for me to eat or drink. I\\u2019m trying to make small talk with these friends of his. The men are also gross and arrogant and the wives are too, but the one next to me is a little more subdued in her behavior and demeanor. She\\u2019s not loud and laughing. She\\u2019s more quiet and we are sitting next to each other. I feel a little connection with her, although at one point someone spills a cocktail all over both of us and it\\u2019s sticky and she\\u2019s laughing but I\\u2019m annoyed. Then somehow the dinner is over and the scene changes because now I'm off by myself. I\\u2019m really grateful to be by myself. I\\u2019m walking up through these hills and I can still see the restaurant I had been in, which is on a pier. I have an impression of the ocean that was part of the background of this restaurant. But now I\\u2019m walking through these smaller rolling hills - they\\u2019re all green. There are copses of trees and when I look up the hill, it\\u2019s thickly covered in forest, but I\\u2019m not in that thicker part yet. There\\u2019s a fire somewhere and now I\\u2019m following these men who are firefighters - they\\u2019re very burly, muscular and thick - cliche of a firefighter. I\\u2019m on stealth mode for some reason. I know I have to get to this fire to see what\\u2019s going on, but I don\\u2019t want to get in the way of the firefighters. So I'm following them, but being very sneaky and hiding behind some of the trees as I follow them to this road. I can hear dispatch giving them instructions to the road of how to get to the fire. I\\u2019m following along but sneaking behind everyone, though I can see everything playing out in front of me. Then I get to this place where I\\u2019m looking at the road and I can see the fire engines. It\\u2019s a dirt road, but there are houses along it. They are driving through neighborhoods, but where I\\u2019m standing, there\\u2019s a souvenir store like what you'd see at Disneyland to pick up Disneyland stuff. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what the souvenirs are, but it has that feel of a place where tourists come to spend money. I\\u2019m in this store but still watching what\\u2019s happening outside as the firefighters are heading towards this fire. All of a sudden, there is an assassination and I\\u2019m watching the person who is supposed to be doing the assassinating. I\\u2019m not entirely sure who he\\u2019s supposed to kill, but this person is an elf and has a silver bow that he\\u2019s going to do the assasination with. I\\u2019m watching him weave through the crowd and hide behind some of the displays in the shop. He finally gets his eyes on the person he\\u2019s going to assassinate. He puts his silver bow down next to him and it starts sliding away. All of a sudden the aisles in this store mimic the hills I\\u2019ve been walking on. This bow starts to slide away from him and somebody notices it and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you\\u2019re going to kill your target if your bow is sliding away.\\u201d He looks up and realizes that somebody else has been tracking him as he\\u2019s been tracking his target, and I\\u2019ve been watching all of this go on. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a commotion outside the store. The woman who had been sitting next to me at dinner is being attacked by someone - whether it is the assassin's target or not, I\\u2019m not sure, but I see her pulled behind the side of the building and then there\\u2019s screaming. I\\u2019m really worried at this point because it doesn\\u2019t seem like anyone is going to stop them, except maybe this assassin in front of me with his bow sliding away down the hill. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"There were many different parts to this dream - some of them in one of the houses I remodeled when I was younger and one in a larger home I don\\u2019t recognize. The section of this dream that stood out the most was towards the end when I was in a dorm room. I was so exhausted from everything I\\u2019d been doing and I just wanted to lay down and sleep until the graduation ceremony I was to go to. I laid down on what looked like a chaise lounge in a bedroom in a dorm room. There was another bed across from me. The entrance to the bathroom was in between the two beds. Although I was exhausted, I was aware, not awake, but aware, that a young man had come into the room and was also getting ready for the graduation. I\\u2019m also young - we\\u2019re both college aged. He\\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\\u2019ve ever seen, like from a different realm beautiful. That was the consensus all around, it wasn\\u2019t just my thoughts, the other women who were around thought the same. He\\u2019s being very considerate of the fact that I'm so tired and has not woken me at all, although I am still aware that he\\u2019s there, I\\u2019m still sleeping because I can feel the exhaustion dragging at my bones. There\\u2019s some sort of conversation he\\u2019s having with some other young women in the room about the plants, the flowers, that he has gathered for lies. He has a very magical quality about him - he seems very wise and ancient, like he knows a lot. So he\\u2019s explaining a little bit about why he\\u2019s picked plants for the leis for this graduation. He actually comes in and sits near me on my little bed, chaise-lounge, and is explaining one of the plants to some of the other women in the room, but I wake up at this point and as he\\u2019s explaining it, I\\u2019m looking at the plant. In the meantime, this beautiful young man creature is trying to get me to hurry because it\\u2019s time to get to this graduation. We haven\\u2019t been, but I\\u2019m just so mesmerized by all the different leis and necklaces in this box - there\\u2019s kukui nut leis and necklaces made of seed beds with over a hundred strands and they\\u2019re twisted together in pink and white and they\\u2019re heavy and gorgeous. But I know how much work has gone into making all these necklaces. There\\u2019s necklaces that have other polished crystal stones that look like pieces of peridot and darker stones, so maybe obsidian and onyx and those are single strands, but the stones are rather large. I start hanging them up in front of me. Suddenly these hooks appear and the hooks begin to fill with all of these necklaces and I\\u2019m running out of room for the hooks for the necklaces to hang. Also in the box is this huge ball of twine, but it reminds me of silk that you use to make necklaces with and it\\u2019s dyed a dark purple and there\\u2019s also beads that are not actually seeds from a plant about the size of those cilantro seeds. They\\u2019re dark brown and dried out with holes drilled through them. There\\u2019s a little package of them and it looks like 50 or so of them. I realize that I want to strand my own necklace with some of these seeds and make my own for part of the graduation although I have no time and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019d want to do that. I start to bead some of these seeds on the silk twine. I can hear myself say I can put them all on and the young man who is standing there gets a little upset with me and he says, \\u201cNo, those are too powerful. You only need 6.\\u201d I look at him and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s very adamant that I only need 6 on this necklace I\\u2019m making. So I stop. I have probably 10 or 12 on by now, but I stop making the necklace and I put it down. I realize I\\u2019m not going to have time to finish that necklace and I just need to pick one from all the ones I have and get to this graduation. Then the dream shifts and I don\\u2019t remember the rest.\"],[\"I only remember a snippet of this dream. I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It\\u2019s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I\\u2019m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It\\u2019s warm so I don\\u2019t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I\\u2019m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I\\u2019ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I\\u2019m headed back in their direction. As I\\u2019m walking down the street, I\\u2019m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There\\u2019s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there\\u2019s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there\\u2019s very tall windows - they\\u2019re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it\\u2019s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I\\u2019m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I\\u2019m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She\\u2019s talking to her daughter. She\\u2019s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there\\u2019s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that\\u2019s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I\\u2019m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I\\u2019m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There\\u2019s an awkwardness now because I don\\u2019t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She\\u2019s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I\\u2019ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I\\u2019m wearing doesn\\u2019t have any pockets and I also suddenly can\\u2019t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I\\u2019m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I\\u2019m so distraught and I wonder if it\\u2019s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don\\u2019t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It\\u2019s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There\\u2019s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody\\u2019s birthday, I\\u2019m not sure whose. Maybe we\\u2019re celebrating everybody\\u2019s birthday. We\\u2019re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There\\u2019s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we\\u2019re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I\\u2019m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I\\u2019m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I\\u2019ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s this man I want you to meet.\\u201d She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it\\u2019s Cyril or something but I don\\u2019t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I\\u2019m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I\\u2019m at her home and it\\u2019s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We\\u2019re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis is the person I want you to meet.\\u201d He\\u2019s got this leather jacket and his hair is longish and curly or wavy and dark. Yes, he\\u2019s definitely good looking, but all my alarm bells are going off because he\\u2019s riding a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket - how cliche. And he\\u2019s got tattoos. She says, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s a plant medicine maker, so he knows how to make medicine from plants.\\u201d That peaks my interest because you don\\u2019t meet a lot of men who know how to do that. But I\\u2019m still feeling like I\\u2019m being put on the spot and I don't appreciate matchmaking. It feels awkward because I know he\\u2019s been invited there to meet with me. I don\\u2019t like those kind of situations. I would much rather there be an organic conversation where you\\u2019ve met or something. In this part of the dream I am feeling so awkward with meeting this guy. But I\\u2019m still feeling tender feelings for my friend - I still love her very much and I don't care that she\\u2019s set me up with this dude. I think it\\u2019s kind of funny. Anyway, I\\u2019m not into it. In the next part of the dream, I\\u2019m taking him and a couple friends on a tour. The dream switches scenes again. Now I\\u2019ve left my friend who has done the introductions, but this guy is with me. He\\u2019s off the motorcycle at this point and there are other guys with him. They\\u2019re his friends, I think, but they\\u2019re all strangers to me. I\\u2019m giving them a tour of what I think is my old high school, but it\\u2019s in the snow and my old high school was in Hawaii. So this version of my high school is somewhere in the snow - there\\u2019s lots of ice. We get in a car and I\\u2019m driving them up and around the drive that usually takes us to the school. We drive past the chapel part I grew up going to, past the admissions building. I\\u2019m taking them onto campus because these guys are all going to run a race. So it\\u2019s a bunch of hotshot runners or super athletic guys. Again I\\u2019m asking myself, \\u201cWhy am I with all these guys? Why am I showing them around?\\u201d So we actually end up driving past the beginning of the race and we have to go park way down below in a parking lot. To get to the beginning of the race is a ton of stairs covered in snow and ice. Now because it took a while to drive around, school has let out, so there\\u2019s a bunch of students out and it\\u2019s really really crowded. So these men I\\u2019m leading around are getting a little bit frustrated because it\\u2019s taking extra long to get to the race. They\\u2019re worried they\\u2019re going to miss it - it\\u2019s a running, cross country race. It\\u2019s cold and they\\u2019re in their running shorts - not my problem. I lead them up to the beginning of the race through all these stairs. We\\u2019re winding our ways through the crowds, being careful not to slip on the ice. The headmaster of the school comes to greet us. What\\u2019s interesting is that the school now has a ton of people of color going to it, including black people, but these guys I\\u2019m bringing with me are all white. This is interesting because I\\u2019m noticing as we\\u2019re walking through the crowd, the guys I\\u2019m leading are being rude. They\\u2019re totally trying to use their white male dominance to move themselves through this crowd. They\\u2019re pissing a lot of people off. So the headmaster meets me, and the headmaster in this dream is actually the head of the Waldorf School my kids currently go to now. Her name is Cecilia and she\\u2019s a woman of color. She meets me and helps me lead these men to the start of the race. But she is giving them a lecture on white male privilege, dominance, the patriarchy and their atrocious behavior. There\\u2019s a part of me rubbing my hands in glee, getting to listen to Cecilia school these men who have been incredibly arrogant. We get to the start of the race, which is interesting, because it\\u2019s actually through a bunch of buildings and they have to race through a bunch of doorways before they can get outside. It\\u2019s literally doorways and Cecilia has had me go open up some of the doors so they know which doors to go through. I mark them somehow, so there\\u2019s literally a little note that says, \\u201cRun through this door,\\u201d so they can find their way to the outside, because there is an outside part of this race, but it literally starts in a building and they have to run through these doorways. Now Cecilia has been joined by a male teacher of color who is continuing the lesson and lecture for these white men who are all still in their running gear - short shorts, tennis shoes, a sweater because it\\u2019s cold. They are finishing up this lecture and the white men are part of this other group. The other group has people of color in it. They\\u2019re not in the front to start this race. I really don't know how it\\u2019s going to go because everyone has to run through these doors and these doors are not lined up one after the other. You run through a door, then you have to hang a right to go through another door. It\\u2019s quite maze-like until you get out. But they\\u2019re all set up, ready to go, and the lecturing is done. Sure enough, somebody shoots off one of those little start guns and they start running through. The dream ends there.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a large house with two stories. I think it's my ex-husband\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m not sure. He\\u2019s there or his presence is felt at least, but I don\\u2019t actually see him. There is an upstairs bedroom with a crib in it. There are two babies in it. One of the babies is mine or I gave birth to it. I can\\u2019t tell. It\\u2019s about a year and half and I have this knowing that I left it when it was younger and I\\u2019m coming back now. I\\u2019m not sure why I\\u2019m coming back. I just know that when I see this baby in the cradle that it needs nourishment - it needs feeding. So I bring it to my breast to nurse it. I\\u2019m worried that ti didn\\u2019t get all the nutrients it needed when it was younger. So while I\\u2019m nursing it, I can feel that it\\u2019s a relief for me somehow - like when you get engorged it is taking the pressure off my chest, out of my breast and the baby is getting what it needs. But the whole time I have this sense of sorrow or sadness like I had perhaps abandoned the baby or there was some reason why I wasn\\u2019t able to be with the baby when it was younger and I\\u2019m only coming back now to tend it now that it\\u2019s a year and a half. As I nurse the baby I can feel the relief in my chest and my breasts. It\\u2019s sucking hard like it\\u2019s desperate to get what I have for itself. This is the only part of the dream I remember; there are other pieces, but those are gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a quest and there are a lot of different characters on this quest. I am being escorted by my dad. He\\u2019s the male figure who is with me. There\\u2019s also another part of the party - a child, a younger person, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is. We\\u2019re headed out into what looks like a rather desolate lava field. But before we go, I am with a gypsy woman. I have met with this gypsy woman and we are in her caravan. It\\u2019s a cross between an old fashioned caravan drawn by a pair of horses but also an RV. It\\u2019s awesome. On the inside, it\\u2019s set up the way an RV is set up - you can see through the front windows where the driver\\u2019s seat is, but it\\u2019s still very witchy on the inside. This gypsy woman travels around but doesn\\u2019t necessarily look like a regular gypsy with scarves and whatnot. She is dressed in long robes and has longer hair. She has jewelry and there\\u2019s something about the jewelry - it\\u2019s earrings. I\\u2019m on a quest, but there\\u2019s two, so the first one I go on, I have a particular pair of earrings I pick out from her and I wear them. They\\u2019re a talisman of some sort. They are either protective or hold magic powers that enhance my own. I\\u2019m not entirely sure. I wear these out on this quest and I go out. I don\\u2019t remember the details of it, but I come back into the van. It\\u2019s time for me to continue on the quest, but it\\u2019s a level up now. I\\u2019ve realized this time around that the earrings are really important and I need a good pair for what I\\u2019m going to do. I\\u2019m going through what she has and there\\u2019s this pair that is just stunning. One earring is pearls with long chains and other gems on the bottom. The other earring that\\u2019s part of this pair is a huge chandelier earring which reaches past my breast. It\\u2019s really long. I put them both on and I can feel myself all of a sudden level up, like you would in a video game. She is trying to tell me what the different properties of these earrings are based on the different stones and what\\u2019s in them and what they will allow me to do. So my dad or whoever it - the male figure - is in the background, he\\u2019s still with me. He just is kind of there - he was just kind of there on the first quest and he\\u2019s just kind of there on the second quest. He does make a few suggestions about how to go about doing things, but he\\u2019s definitely taking a backseat. This is all up to me. The gypsy woman and I are conversing about the powers of the earrings, but also my own magical powers that will help me out during this section part of the quest. Then the scene changes from this questing to me being in what seems like a village. It kind of reminds me of the villages you visit in Disneyland. They\\u2019re a little bit fake but they\\u2019re kind of neat because there\\u2019s cool stuff in them. This village is smallish and there is an appearance of all my high school classmates and other people I don't know who are just filling in the spaces. I\\u2019m watching as one of my high school friends - someone who\\u2019s in an older class is building a structure out of logs. It\\u2019s an art piece in the center of the town. The rest of us are coming to gather around. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going and I see him build this. I leave and I go do something else. The structure is up and I see people come and have little meetings around this structure. I\\u2019m in a pool and it\\u2019s an indoor pool entirely enclosed in glass. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m there watching people come and go. There\\u2019s meetings happening. My mom has shown up and I hear her having a meeting with some of my classmates. This is very interesting because one of my classmates is having a tantrum and he\\u2019s screaming and crying just like a little kid would. I can't even see him, but I know who it is by his voice. But I don\\u2019t know what my mom is saying and I don\\u2019t know what the meeting is about. In some way she is this boss or it feels like she\\u2019s some sort of crime lord and my classmates are coming and going and doing her bidding, essentially. I\\u2019m shocked to hear my classmate screaming and crying because it seems like such childish behavior. But my mom is not phased by it at all. I can\\u2019t actually see any of this. I can only hear it and feel what\\u2019s going on. I do not have vision of what this is - they are not in my eyesight. I\\u2019m still in this pool/atrium place and their meeting is somewhere above me - like there\\u2019s rooms upstairs above me. I\\u2019ve stepped out of the atrium and it\\u2019s towards my back. Another classmate has her coffee in hand. It looks like she\\u2019s just woken up and she's in her pajamas. She stomps towards that art piece that the other classmate had made and she just pulls the logs down, yelling. I don\\u2019t even know what she\\u2019s yelling about, but she\\u2019s making the assumption that one of our classmates had made the artpiece. When we tell her that it was actually an upperclassman, she gets a little bit freaked out, but it\\u2019s too late. She can\\u2019t fix the sculpture. It\\u2019s already been pulled down. Throughout this whole time, I am part of this scene - I am part of the village, I am part of what's going on, but I\\u2019m also not. I\\u2019m also the observer and again the outcast, not really included, but also supposed to observe what's going on. Then my alarm went off, so I don\\u2019t remember the rest of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It\\u2019s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we\\u2019re on our way to the place. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s a road that\\u2019s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We\\u2019re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there\\u2019s a ravine under us. We\\u2019re headed to a cave where we\\u2019re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it\\u2019s like - it\\u2019s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I\\u2019m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there\\u2019s water that\\u2019s swirling around the rocks. It\\u2019s so fun because we\\u2019re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I\\u2019m floating and we\\u2019re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We\\u2019re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it\\u2019s smooth and flat. It\\u2019s still light in a sense, it\\u2019s not full daylight. We can still see. It\\u2019s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we\\u2019re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It\\u2019s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I\\u2019ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it\\u2019s very particular, it\\u2019s something I asked for. Then it\\u2019s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I\\u2019m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that\\u2019s everywhere and the flowers - they\\u2019re gathering them. It\\u2019s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There\\u2019s now a table. There\\u2019s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she\\u2019s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they\\u2019re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we\\u2019re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we\\u2019re carrying bags of trash because we\\u2019ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we\\u2019re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn\\u2019t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. It\\u2019s evening time. I am walking around a college campus. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who\\u2019s with me, but it\\u2019s another woman. I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She\\u2019s beautiful. She\\u2019s a little bit sad - she\\u2019s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she\\u2019s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it\\u2019s like an artist studio. It\\u2019s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She\\u2019s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there\\u2019s not much room. We\\u2019re hanging out with her and I\\u2019m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn\\u2019t even have a bathroom and I don\\u2019t think it has a kitchen area - it\\u2019s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She\\u2019s still really, really sad. I\\u2019m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she\\u2019s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend\\u2019s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There\\u2019s a little tension between them, like a depression. They\\u2019re together but they\\u2019re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don\\u2019t know why. They\\u2019re talking and there\\u2019s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it\\u2019s going to be fine - let\\u2019s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it\\u2019s full dark now. There\\u2019s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He\\u2019s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he\\u2019s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He\\u2019s kind of got a belly. He just doesn\\u2019t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there\\u2019s other college kids lingering around. There\\u2019s stuff happening and I\\u2019m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I\\u2019m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It\\u2019s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don\\u2019t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they\\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\\u2019s very orderly. It\\u2019s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they\\u2019re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it\\u2019s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I\\u2019m watching these people come and go and there\\u2019s this competitive energy in me where I\\u2019m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It\\u2019s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There\\u2019s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who\\u2019s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That\\u2019s the atmosphere that we\\u2019re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We\\u2019re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There\\u2019s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there\\u2019s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it\\u2019s mine. But he\\u2019s holding the baby and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I sort of like holding the baby.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don\\u2019t say anything but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, we should do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we\\u2019ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we\\u2019re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He\\u2019s in a costume of some sort and he\\u2019s asking me if I recognize who he is. I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s familiar but I can\\u2019t quite place it.\\u201d Somebody says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your gloves.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cOh yeah my gloves!\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, your Hans Solo!\\u201d He runs off to get his gloves and I\\u2019m still somehow totally content because we\\u2019re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he\\u2019s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There\\u2019s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he\\u2019s at least 10 years younger - which is why I\\u2019m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it\\u2019s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he\\u2019s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I\\u2019m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It\\u2019s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I\\u2019m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, but we\\u2019re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I\\u2019m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it\\u2019s a spaceship. It\\u2019s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they\\u2019re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I\\u2019m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they\\u2019re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I\\u2019m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I\\u2019m starting to be crushed. So I\\u2019m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It\\u2019s me and my friend, Aila. We\\u2019re in a car together, traveling. It\\u2019s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There\\u2019s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it\\u2019s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He\\u2019s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He\\u2019s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don\\u2019t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he\\u2019s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it\\u2019s the sample. It\\u2019s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that\\u2019s made out of gold and it\\u2019s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who\\u2019s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there\\u2019s something up with these bracelets because the material they\\u2019re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, we all need one of these.\\u201d He\\u2019s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it\\u2019s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that\\u2019s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he\\u2019s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there\\u2019s more, but that's all I can remember right now.\"],[\"Holy crap. This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I\\u2019m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he\\u2019s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he\\u2019s talking with me and he\\u2019s trying to court me. He\\u2019s showing me all the things he\\u2019s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he\\u2019s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he\\u2019s done, he\\u2019s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it\\u2019s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He\\u2019s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It\\u2019s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I\\u2019m in my home now - it\\u2019s not very descriptive, I just know I\\u2019m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn\\u2019t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That\\u2019s my first \\u201coh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn\\u2019t look very safe. She\\u2019s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it\\u2019s falling out. There\\u2019s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it\\u2019s also filthy. She\\u2019s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I\\u2019m offering to make them a meal - I guess they\\u2019re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she\\u2019s wild. She doesn\\u2019t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He\\u2019s just telling her what to do. He\\u2019s literally telling her: \\u201cOkay, now do this, do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s so proud of himself. He thinks he\\u2019s being the best dad. I\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god, your daughter is wrecked.\\u201d I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I\\u2019m with the next man in the lineup. It\\u2019s my ex-husband. He\\u2019s different. He\\u2019s also trying to show me how different he is. He\\u2019s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We\\u2019re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There\\u2019s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we\\u2019re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I\\u2019m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I\\u2019m really excited for their blind date. I\\u2019m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we\\u2019re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they\\u2019re snuggling up. I\\u2019m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it\\u2019s cute, it\\u2019s sweet. There\\u2019s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it\\u2019s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there\\u2019s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: \\u201cCan she do it? Is she strong enough?\\u201d Since he\\u2019s already over my back, he\\u2019s essentially in the fireman\\u2019s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\\u2019t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.\\u201d I realize that that\\u2019s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I\\u2019m with the next man. It\\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you\\u2019re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He\\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We\\u2019re hanging out and i\\u2019s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there\\u2019s also different types of equipment around, too. There\\u2019s these three younger men and they\\u2019re teachers or they\\u2019re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: \\u201cOh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.\\u201d So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We\\u2019ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He\\u2019s so attentive and affectionate. He\\u2019s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he\\u2019s getting agitated and I think that\\u2019s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn\\u2019t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken\\u2019s hat and I\\u2019d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He\\u2019s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5\\u20196\\u201d, I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d and Luke\\u2019s about 6\\u20192\\u201d or 3\\u201d or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It\\u2019s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I\\u2019ve seen you strip.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? I\\u2019ve been stripping?!\\u201d Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, \\u201cOh yeah, I totally did that, but don\\u2019t know what it was for.\\u201d Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you\\u2019re amazing and I didn\\u2019t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, \\u201cWhat, do you think you want my hat back now?\\u201d He\\u2019s saying this like he\\u2019s not going to give it to me and I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m like whatever. I hadn\\u2019t thought of it and it\\u2019s not a big deal to me. We\\u2019re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We\\u2019re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he\\u2019s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it\\u2019s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it\\u2019s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I\\u2019m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he\\u2019s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to be a part of any of them. They all seem so unstable!\\u201d\"],[\"There are three distinct parts to this dream. The first part I remember is a gathering of a lot of women - at least 25 of us. It\\u2019s a retreat and it\\u2019s towards the end of the retreat. It\\u2019s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She\\u2019s been doing a lot of the teaching. I\\u2019ve been in the mix, too. I\\u2019m not a participant, but I\\u2019m there. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m helping out with the retreat or not. She\\u2019s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They\\u2019re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She\\u2019s giving them a speech, more or less, that\\u2019s along the lines of: \\u201cOkay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.\\u201d I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn\\u2019t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else\\u2019s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I\\u2019m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they\\u2019re all complaining. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cDid you not learn anything from what we just did?\\u201d They\\u2019re all holding hands with each other. They\\u2019re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I\\u2019m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that\\u2019s what I should be doing because I\\u2019m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don\\u2019t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave their clothes where they are and I walk away from the clothesline and I walk away from the whole retreat. I am thinking that I need to leave them all to their own devices because they don\\u2019t get it. That\\u2019s the thought going through my head. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m in conversation with my ex-husband about our daughter. It\\u2019s my time with them - we\\u2019re still sharing custody and visiting time. My son is there and he\\u2019s closeby - he\\u2019s with me. But my daughter is not there and I\\u2019m asking my ex where she is. He tells me, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s at her friend Gus or Gum\\u2019s house.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWho is that? I don\\u2019t know who that is.\\u201d He tells me that he is a teammate of hers. She\\u2019s apparently playing soccer and this is her teammate. But she\\u2019s 12 and this boy is a little bit older - that\\u2019s the impression I get. I\\u2019m starting to get pissed off and scared because I don\\u2019t know this kid\\u2019s parents and they live in another county. There\\u2019s a little map flashing before my eyes and the place they live is highlighted and flashing and it\\u2019s far away from where we are - at least a day away by car. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I don\\u2019t know this kid, I don\\u2019t know his parents, I haven\\u2019t talked with my daughter in a long time and I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing and I don\\u2019t trust that she\\u2019s safe. I start yelling at my ex, telling her he can\\u2019t just let her go to places that he doesn\\u2019t know the parents or the situation just because she wants to hang out with a boy, essentially. He doesn\\u2019t get it. His face turns stone cold. I\\u2019m trying to keep my voice even and level. But the more he grey rocks what I say, the louder and frustrated I get until I\\u2019m just yelling at him. I\\u2019m so disgusted with him. His dad is the one driving my daughter down and back and he\\u2019s there. I\\u2019m just as mad and frustrated at him. It feels very much like they\\u2019re stonewalling me and taking my daughter. But they're putting her at risk is what I feel. I'm panicked and so upset but getting no answers from them. I\\u2019m asking them where this boy lives because I want to go pick her up, but they won\\u2019t tell me. So the dreams shifts again and I retain the panic. In the next shift of the dream, I\\u2019m hanging with some friends - some are from high school, some are from this time - other instructors I\\u2019ve met at the pole studio. We\\u2019re all outside. It\\u2019s a bright, beautiful sunny day. We\\u2019re walking down a paved path - it\\u2019s available for a lot of people to walk on. It\\u2019s me and another girl and another guy. Other couples are around me as well. We\\u2019re all walking and there\\u2019s space between the other couples and me and this girl and this guy. I\\u2019m noticing that they\\u2019re starting to hit it off. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m jealous or frustrated. I\\u2019m having an emotional reaction, but not sure. Some of it is that panic has carried over from the last part of the dream. Again I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou guys don\\u2019t really know each other. It\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up right now.\\u201d We all stop walking. We end up at some sort of grassy area. The couples have split off - they have their own blankets. This guy and this girl - there\\u2019s a sense that I know who they are, but I\\u2019m not seeing who they actually are - they split off, too. Everyone gets under a blanket. I\\u2019m watching and can tell that these two are hooking up. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know each other!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at this through the lens of us being in quarantine and I\\u2019m thinking it\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up with someone you\\u2019ve just met while we\\u2019re in this quarantine. I\\u2019m just really concerned again. Then somebody passes out bathing suits to all of the women. I\\u2019m watching as all of the women and all these couples put these bathing suits on. They look different on every single woman. It\\u2019s very interesting to see how it\\u2019s the same cut of bathing suit bikini, but looks so different on every single woman. I have one, too, and am trying to put it on. But I\\u2019m putting it on over my clothes and I don\\u2019t understand why I\\u2019m doing that, other than the thought going through my head is that I want the added layer of protection. Everybody else seems a little bit carefree and somewhat nonchalant about the situation we find ourselves in. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve hooked up with their person and it\\u2019s them and their person and they\\u2019re okay. But I\\u2019m by myself. I\\u2019m watching all these couples and the ones that have been together I\\u2019m like, \\u201cyeah okay, they\\u2019re good,\\u201d but the ones that haven't been together, I\\u2019m totally horrified and that sense of not just panic, but a little bit that I\\u2019m in the wrong frequency goes through all the dreams - that I\\u2019m just not in the right timeline. That sense, I woke up with and still feel.\"],[\"I\\u2019m working with a friend and we\\u2019re having a meeting. She also has clients and we\\u2019re in her house. She\\u2019s showing them how she does some of her artwork - some of her painting. I\\u2019ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that\\u2019s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she\\u2019s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I\\u2019m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She\\u2019s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I\\u2019m wearing. I say, \\u201cThis is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.\\u201d It feels good between us - she\\u2019s my friend and my boss. We\\u2019re having a good time and I\\u2019m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We\\u2019re in the same house area, but now it\\u2019s my house. We\\u2019ve completed our work and she leaves. I\\u2019m realizing there\\u2019s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, \\u201cHey, there\\u2019s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I\\u2019m not going to get it to you this month.\\u201d I\\u2019m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It\\u2019s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I\\u2019m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven\\u2019t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t received your rent check this month. And I\\u2019ve heard that there\\u2019s a drone outside your house and I\\u2019m a little bit confused.\\u201d He\\u2019s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can\\u2019t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he\\u2019s saying is that there\\u2019s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It\\u2019s at the windows and it films me. I feel super violated - like my privacy has been violated. He\\u2019s really shaming about it even though I didn\\u2019t know there was a drone there. But his connection finally dies and I don\\u2019t hear him anymore. I go to call him back and try to get a hold of him so I can tell him I\\u2019m not paying rent. I hear him say something about there\\u2019s going to be an inspection. Then the connection is totally dead. I feel concerned because now I\\u2019m worried about this drone. I head back to the house. The house looks like a Victorain era dollhouse - it\\u2019s got one of those roundish rooms that reminds me of a tower and a lot of frill on the trim. I\\u2019m walking towards the house, but first I\\u2019m in the parking lot. There\\u2019s a parking lot and what looks like low income housing - they\\u2019re all one-story, the roof is flat, they\\u2019ve got a carport, and they\\u2019re all connected like apartments or a motel, actually. I see a friend of mine and she\\u2019s got a couple of kids. Then there\\u2019s a sheriff and he\\u2019s inspecting the place, but giving her an extra hard time. She has the front door open and her kids are running around. He\\u2019s telling her: \\u201cYour house looks dirty from outside.\\u201d He\\u2019s making her show him her car which also is dirty. He\\u2019s totally just giving her a hard time. I\\u2019m watching to make sure that he\\u2019s not just harassing her. It feels like he\\u2019s doing his job, but going out of his way to be a total asshole. Then he sees me and he heads towards my place, and he\\u2019s like: \\u201cYour house stinks. It smells, especially right here on the back porch area.\\u201d There\\u2019s actually another guy waiting for me on my porch. I recognize him as my lover - I think - but he doesn\\u2019t look like my type at all. He\\u2019s got blond hair and blue eyes. He\\u2019s kind of tall and it looks like he\\u2019s just come from a football game because he\\u2019s got his football gear and he\\u2019s really sweaty, stinky and smelly. But I guess this is my person because I\\u2019m really happy to see him. He\\u2019s standing on this porch where the law enforcement person is telling me it smells really bad. I look and I see there\\u2019s a window seat that juts out from the house over the porch a little bit. Underneath the window seat is one brown wool sock and one bottle of forgotten soda or something. But the foundation of this porch is all stone and is rotted - there\\u2019s moss and it\\u2019s black and the stone is crumbling. My lover is standing up there and he comes down and he greets me. He shushes the sheriff and we start to go into the house. But my brother shows up. He starts to dig out the stone that\\u2019s rotted. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it!\\u201d I know that the smell coming from it and whatever is under it is supposed to stay under, like it\\u2019s an old ancient curse or something - kind of like they bury vampires. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d But my brother starts digging it up. Sure enough, there\\u2019s a body wrapped in chains. It\\u2019s folded in on itself. As soon as my brother gets the rock off, it unfolds itself and it\\u2019s a king. I\\u2019m horrified: \\u201cNow you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve just let the bad guy out.\\u201d Then I hear some other rock crumbling. I\\u2019m up in the tower place now because it has all the windows. I turn and from my vantage point, I see that the queen has been let out, too. She\\u2019s also been in chains. They both have gunk on them because they're so old. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck, this is not good.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to grab me and my lover - now we have to leave the house. Now we have to get down these stairs and past these things and out past the house. There\\u2019s a level of horror and also comedy because the queen is hideously ugly and she\\u2019s just bitching. She\\u2019s clearly very bad tempered and it\\u2019s a little bit cliche in that way. We\\u2019re coming down the stairs trying to avoid them and we do make it outside. I don\\u2019t know what happens to my lover - he disappears. I run into this 11 or 12 year old boy. He\\u2019s kind of playful and naughty - very much trickster energy. I can hear a voice that\\u2019s sort of narrating what\\u2019s happening with this queen and king coming out and this boy who is kind of teasing. He\\u2019s running off away from me and the queen and king are trying to follow him. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re the bad guys trying to catch this boy, but this voice that I\\u2019m hearing suddenly shows up. It\\u2019s a man with a troubadour hat with a feather and he\\u2019s dressed in stockings - like Shakespeare, old style. He\\u2019s got one of those frilly collars around his neck. It turns out he\\u2019s the one that either the king and queen are chasing, or he\\u2019s chasing the boy. I\\u2019m not sure. It\\u2019s a little convoluted. I just know it's time to get the hell out of there because whatever is happening is not my business. The house is a lost cause. I have no idea where my lover went. My brother is off - I don\\u2019t know where he went; he let these things out and now he\\u2019s gone. I\\u2019ve been heading towards a crowd, following this boy and watching things unfold and I just let myself get lost in the crowd. \"],[\"I am with a friend but I\\u2019m not actually sure who it is - there\\u2019s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we\\u2019ve known each other for a while. We\\u2019re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don\\u2019t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We\\u2019re walking through a town. We\\u2019re on the streets of the downtown area. It\\u2019s dark - like night time or really early morning. We\\u2019re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that\\u2019s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she\\u2019s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it\\u2019s a room off to the side. I\\u2019m so happy to see her. She\\u2019s such a beautiful soul. And she\\u2019s so happy to see me. She\\u2019s showing me some of the pieces she\\u2019s working on. It\\u2019s an interesting interaction because there\\u2019s this air of how much we love each other and she\\u2019s so excited about all her work and I\\u2019m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They\\u2019re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there\\u2019s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it\\u2019s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she\\u2019s found a different coffee shop. So we\\u2019re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It\\u2019s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I\\u2019m happy to see her, but also not. There\\u2019s a little bit of, \\u201cOh no, I don\\u2019t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me\\u201d (which is what happened in real life). So I\\u2019m kind of glad to see her, but there\\u2019s also part of her that\\u2019s also sort of ignoring me. She\\u2019s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I\\u2019m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I\\u2019m with - the one who I still don\\u2019t know who it is - says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.\\u201d So, we\\u2019re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There\\u2019s a bunch of people at it. They\\u2019ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\\u2019m on vacation. I\\u2019m not doing any business. There\\u2019s no meetings.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWell you know this is a BNI meeting.\\u201d The way these things work is if you\\u2019re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn\\u2019t know that was happening, but it feels like that\\u2019s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that\\u2019s gotten us in the mess we\\u2019re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh D\\u2019s here! Great!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my fucking god, get me out of here now.\\u201d He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn\\u2019t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, \\u201cEh.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw.\\u201d He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cFuck, you can\\u2019t even be neutral. You can\\u2019t even control your body. You\\u2019re in my damn space and I don\\u2019t even want to be here!\\u201d I still haven\\u2019t had any food or coffee, so probably I\\u2019m \\u201changry\\u201d - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don\\u2019t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I\\u2019m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it\\u2019s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it\\u2019s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I\\u2019m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There\\u2019s a pier off to my right. There\\u2019s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He\\u2019s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He\\u2019s also writing stuff out in the sand that they\\u2019re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren\\u2019t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I\\u2019m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There\\u2019s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I\\u2019m noticing them as I\\u2019m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I\\u2019m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party, it\\u2019s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I\\u2019m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m feeling like, \\u201cUh, I don\\u2019t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn\\u2019t feel super good.\\u201d Fear of judgment and all that. I\\u2019m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we\\u2019re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll be back.\\u201d I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019ve never seen before, but it's a house that\\u2019s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I\\u2019m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I\\u2019m at her house, which I don\\u2019t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They\\u2019re talking to me about planning how they\\u2019re going to remodel parts of their house and how it\\u2019s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they\\u2019re going to earn it. I\\u2019m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he\\u2019s one of those ages). They\\u2019re showing me how they\\u2019re going to do it. They\\u2019re really, really friendly - it\\u2019s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there\\u2019s different ways. I\\u2019m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, \\u201cWell, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.\\u201d So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It\\u2019s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.\\u201d Then my friend is like, \\u201cWell I need you to come and do this thing with me.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I\\u2019m feeling torn because I don\\u2019t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there\\u2019s all these crappy t-shirts like you\\u2019d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They\\u2019re on one of those round racks and I\\u2019m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re doing all these things, come do this with me.\\u201d A second friend from the party comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGuess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.\\u201d She\\u2019s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that\\u2019s where I worked. It\\u2019s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on this field trip with a bunch of children - an entire school\\u2019s worth. They\\u2019re all 5th grade and younger, but not below 2nd grade - there aren\\u2019t really young children there. We\\u2019re at this state park. It\\u2019s gorgeous. There\\u2019s an open field that\\u2019s two football fields long and at least one football field wide. It\\u2019s on one side of the road that\\u2019s the entrance to the park. Trees line the road and the field. On the other side of the field there\\u2019s all forest and it\\u2019s pretty thick and dense forest - it\\u2019s dark and you can\\u2019t see really far into it. Then on the other side of the road it looks like a school with buildings that look like classrooms but also could be places or cabins where you can pay a fee and stay. I see a playground and a cafeteria or place you can eat where they sell the shitty food you\\u2019d find in parks - ice cream cones and corn dogs. There\\u2019s another building on the left hand side of the road with the big open field or meadow. The building is on the end of the field. The road goes down and stops at this huge wide river. On this side there are rocks or sands that go down into the river like a beach. On the other side are tall, tall cliffs that drop off into the river and it is deep on this side but shallow on my side. The river flows from left to right. This is a familiar river to me. So there\\u2019s tons of kids hanging around. I\\u2019m there. At first I thought I was a chaperone, but I\\u2019m not. There\\u2019s tons of other parents who are chaperoning all the kids. I\\u2019m providing supplies. I have bags and bags full of clothes for the kids to wear - the same dress for all the girls to wear or the same pair of jeans for everybody to wear. It\\u2019s really bizarre. I have a hundred pairs of them in all different sizes, so everybody has a pair. I\\u2019m also in charge of setting up and spreading out the food, but also telling people where to sleep. So I\\u2019m basically providing all of the basics for people and organizing it. It feels very much like I\\u2019m providing the most efficient way for everybody to get what they need. But I'm also participating in this sleepover campout as one of hte kids, too. So I\\u2019m not taking a parent role, even though my kids are there because while I\\u2019m providing all these things, I\\u2019m actually in my later twenties. There are some other teenagers or early twenties kids. So there\\u2019s a little bit of an age gap, but not so much. I\\u2019m definitely not in a parental role, per se. With the younger ones, I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re not going in the river and getting drowned. But me and the other twenty year olds are flirting, which is the craziest thing. I\\u2019m making sure everyone is sleeping and finding sleeping areas. I head down to the river and there is a path kind of like a boardwalk - it\\u2019s got wooden slats. I take this path and it\\u2019s taking me towards this other building. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what\\u2019s there. There are some laundry machines. One young man is following me. He\\u2019s blond and his hair is curly, shoulder-length. He\\u2019s very good looking in a very angelic way - the way they paint those angel portraits from the Renaissance era. He\\u2019s got his arms around me. I\\u2019m the older one, definitely showing him how everything works, but he\\u2019s very like: \\u201cI want to be with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m finding it strange because there is at least an 8 year age difference between us. I take him with me to where there is all this laundry piled up from clothes that all of these 100+ kids wore yesterday. I\\u2019m looking at it and realizing I\\u2019d rather be spending time with this person and I don\\u2019t want to be doing all the laundry for everybody and making sure they know where their assigned sleeping places are and making sure that they all eat. So I have just left food out for them to come get as they want. I have left the laundry, like \\u201cYo parents, wash your own laundry if you want.\\u201d I leave them to their own devices to sleep wherever they want - parents you\\u2019re in charge and here are all the sleeping bags. They do, but they all end up being cold and hungry because no one is actually taking care of them now. But I still feel like I\\u2019m not the chaperone or person in charge - I don\\u2019t even know how I ended up with all of the stuff for everyone. I am way more interested in cultivating a relationship with this person, except that it\\u2019s very short-lived. We leave the building that has all of the laundry and other stuff in it. We go back to the group in this big field surrounded by trees. Everybody is milling around. There are a lot of cars parked in part of the field. I\\u2019m watching some parents drive off with their kids but not watching out for other kids. It\\u2019s giving me a heart attack because I\\u2019m afraid someone\\u2019s going to get run over. I leave this guy. He had his arm around me, we were walking side by side and at one point we were holding hands and kissing. But I left him to make sure some of the kids didn\\u2019t get run over. I turn around and he\\u2019s got a blanket over him - one of the blankets I provided. But now he\\u2019s with this younger girl who is younger than him, so I guess she\\u2019s teenage-aged if he\\u2019s in his early twenties. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, what the fuck?!\\u201d at how quick his attentions turned. So now I go back down towards the river one more time. I\\u2019m watching everybody. They\\u2019re awake and playing. Some kids are wearing the clothes I provided, but some kids are wearing other clothes because now they\\u2019ve got it figured out. Some are learning how to swim and there\\u2019s an instructor teaching them how to swim in the river. As I\\u2019m walking down the boardwalk again and there\\u2019s sand off to one side, I see that this dad has soccer balls in a huge jar. He\\u2019s showing the kids that there are three different kinds of soccer balls and they each have different amounts of energy and power. So he\\u2019s keeping them in the jar. One of them is a regular soccer ball - if you drop it, it bounces a little bit but doesn\\u2019t go very far. The next one he shows us, he says, \\u201cYeah, look how much power\\u2019s in this.\\u201d He drops it in the jar and the jar comes back up at least five feet off the ground and you see this soccer ball make an explosion within the jar because it has so much energy and power in it. Then he says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even the strongest one.\\u201d He grabs this third soccer ball and he drops it. When it lands, it\\u2019s in a jar again - somehow these jars are not breaking - and it bounces above my head. Every time the balls bounce, they flashlight. So it\\u2019s three different levels of power within each of these soccer balls. The last two have so much power that they have to be contained within jars. I\\u2019m kind of fascinated by it. He\\u2019s giving these kids a lesson. I\\u2019m paying attention, but then continue to walk by. Then I hear another kid (these kids are more like 12, 13, 14) shouting and he\\u2019s looking in the water. There\\u2019s a gigantic jellyfish that\\u2019s yellow with red long jellyfish arms - I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re called. It\\u2019s floating in the river and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHoly shit! There\\u2019s jellyfish in this river? We should not be teaching the kids how to swim in here.\\u201d It comes up to the shore and then the fucking thing is panicking me becuase it starts to crawl on the land! There\\u2019s the boy who saw it and a couple other girls, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cY\\u2019all need to get away from this thing because it is crawling up the land and it\\u2019s going to sting you.\\u201d I stand on a chair, thinking it won\\u2019t be able to crawl up the chair. It doesn\\u2019t crawl up the chair, but it latches itself onto the bottom of the seat. It\\u2019s an outdoor chair that\\u2019s metal, so the seat is wire - like the crosshatch - and the back is a wrought-iron metal back. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHoly shit! This thing is dangerous because it can crawl on land and it can crawl up a chair!\\u201d It has latched itself to the bottom of the seat. It\\u2019s giving birth and laying two jellyfish babies. I\\u2019m not even sure they\\u2019re jellyfish because they\\u2019re on land! I\\u2019m totally freaked out and trying to make sure that whatever kids that are nearby are out of the way of this jellyfish. I had been standing on that chair and then I step on another chair, then a few steps back. Then I go and tell all the parents to be careful of this fucking crazy jellyfish and don\\u2019t let the kids in the water because it came out of the water. This thing is horrifying me because it can walk on land and it\\u2019s in the water, so it\\u2019s that much more dangerous. I\\u2019m worried about the kids.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a man - I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is. There\\u2019s a couple of other people with us. It feels very cultish - he\\u2019s some sort of guru and has some say over what I do and don\\u2019t do. It\\u2019s very unlike me. We are wandering through a park. There\\u2019s not a lot of people. It feels like people are in quarantine. There is a group of people that are gathered and they\\u2019re listening to music. There are maybe 10 or 15 of them inside of a tent - one of those white event tents and the musicians are in the front. My group with the guru go towards the tent - there's another section of the tent that\\u2019s been walled off and private and we\\u2019re heading there. When I get up to the group of people, I see a bunch of people I know. One of them is Maria. I see her and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! Hi!\\u201d She looks at me and is like, \\u201cHi.\\u201d What\\u2019s really interesting is her face is really round and chubby. It\\u2019s her but her face is swollen or she\\u2019s gotten really fat but only from the jaw up. It\\u2019s a bit weird. I\\u2019m happy to see her but remembering that things did not end well with us. She\\u2019s looking at me and has a look on her face - I can tell that she\\u2019s trying to apologize. She wants to say something along the lines of, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry things ended the way they did.\\u201d As I\\u2019m talking with her, the guru and some of the other group that I\\u2019m a part of (it feels like an open relationship type of situation, but not really because the guru is in charge and the rest of us are like satellites that are with him) are mad that I\\u2019m talking with Maria. The guru doesn\\u2019t want me to talk with her because I\\u2019m still feeling a connection with her. She\\u2019s obviously feeling remorseful about the way things ended. I can see that she\\u2019s trying to make an apology. I\\u2019m sitting down. Maria and I are sitting on these 3-legged stools talking to each other. One of the other people from the guru group comes up to me and tapes a stone onto my wrist. It\\u2019s clear scotch tape and the stone is very flat, no bigger than 2 inches long and maybe a quarter inch thick and maybe an inch in width. It\\u2019s smooth and polished - like marble or granite. So he tapes it to my wrist and is like, \\u201cThe guru wants to see you. He doesn\\u2019t want you here. He wants to remind you that you are his and you need to go back.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to go back. I want to finish this conversation with Maria. We\\u2019re talking. The tent was separated, so the guru group is in one area and the musicians and everyone are in the other. I feel somebody grabbing my foot and pulling me from the stool I\\u2019m sitting on, under the flap that separates the two parts of the tent and back into his space. Maria is a little concerned and upset because she wants to finish talking with me. But she\\u2019s also very curious and wants to know about the group. So she follows me in and I watch as the guru guy works his magic on her. It\\u2019s a brainwashing that I\\u2019m watching happen in front of me. So I\\u2019m sitting there and back in the circle talking with other friends, expressing that I\\u2019m upset and don\\u2019t want to be there. The guru is teaching and trying to give some kind of wisdom and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is bullshit.\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed. There\\u2019s a woven cocoon thing that looks like a basket-weaving with reeds, the size of a birdfeeder - it looks like those ornaments that are narrow on the top and bottom and get wide in the middle and are long, and it has a hole opening for the birds to come in through. The guru is weaving it while he\\u2019s talking. All of a sudden, Maria is with me and I hear her starting to orgasm. I realize he\\u2019s making a spell as he\\u2019s sewing and completing this birdhouse weaving. She\\u2019s sort of against her will but also totally enjoying it. I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, \\u201cWhat the fuck?! How did this happen? When am I going to get what I need?\\u201d\"],[\"This dream really did not want to stick. I kept trying to call it back and it wouldn\\u2019t come even though I could feel the felt sense of it. There was something good going to happen if I could just get the right thing to happen - if I could just be lucid enough in the dream and follow the thread of what felt good, then something good would happen. I was in a large dance hall and the windows were floor to ceiling with curtains on either side. There\\u2019s bleachers. I\\u2019m sitting on the bleachers and take my shoes off. The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they\\u2019re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don\\u2019t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren\\u2019t there. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you\\u2019d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - \\u201chey go look over there, there\\u2019s all these shoes.\\u201d There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn\\u2019t progress through the dream if I didn\\u2019t find them. And I didn\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching these two men. There's been a gathering of Native Hawaiians and they were all making lei for each other. It\\u2019s beautiful. But now I\\u2019m watching this man I know, Stan - he was an upperclassman for a few years when I was in school and he had a twin brother. He\\u2019s standing in front of a huge loom, the size of a garage door. There\\u2019s this other man who is a stranger to the culture, not raised in Hawaii, but he really wants to know how to weave this loom with flowers. It\\u2019s kind of like he\\u2019s trying to learn the native ways. I\\u2019d say these men are both in their late 20s, early 30s. So this man that\\u2019s trying to learn, he\\u2019s a stranger to me in the dream, he has picked a flower - it\\u2019s a gorgeous purple flower with maybe 5 petals that are long and spiky and the stamin in the center are also long and really skinny and you can see the pollen at the tips. He\\u2019s trying to weave this entire loom with these purple flowers. He\\u2019s doing okay under the instruction of Stan. I\\u2019m feeling frustrated watching him because that\\u2019s not a flower that Native Hawaiians ever wove with or made lei with. So I\\u2019m like this guy doesn\\u2019t get it - he doesn\\u2019t understand the meaning of each flower that the Hawaiians would use. But he\\u2019s gotten most of the door woven. He keeps messing up. I go to try to help him complete it. Parts of what he\\u2019s woven falling off the frame. I\\u2019m trying to help him keep it taut. I started out observing, but now I\\u2019m part of the dream. I\\u2019m trying to show him how and the other guy is trying to show him how, too. He doesn\\u2019t get it. There\\u2019s a part of me that\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis guy is a little bit mental, he\\u2019s slow on the uptake, he\\u2019s not understanding how to do this.\\u201d Then Stan suddenly turns into a black cat and is so affectionate with me. This is funny because cats are not always affectionate. But as a cat, he\\u2019s super affectionate with me and I can feel he\\u2019s still waiting for this other guy to complete the weaving. This woman shows up, her name is Audrey (she plays the guitar and she\\u2019s an incredible musician). She is trying to give more pointers to the guy doing the weaving, but also mentioning: \\u201cOh my gosh, I\\u2019ve never seen him do that as a cat. I\\u2019ve never seen him rub up on somebody so much and be in your lap and try to be so affectionate.\\u201d I am a little bit curious about this. It seems like the cat wants to be turned back into Stan, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure what he needs, except for that the weaving needs to be finished. The woman does tell the other guy who has been doing the weaving: \\u201cJust so you know, we don\\u2019t use that flower for that and that\\u2019s why the spell is not going right. Then the weaving is finished and we leave it where it is hanging in this loom over a garage. Audrey is showing me some rings that she has. This whole time the black cat is on me and with me. She has pulled down this tupperware container from a shelf above the garage door. There are all these rings in it that are all gold. She says: \\u201cYou need to take a ring, this is what the cat is trying to tell you.\\u201d She shows me one of the rings she\\u2019s wearing from the container. It\\u2019s pure gold and really thick, and segmented like those watches you can slip on because they\\u2019re elastic. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay I\\u2019ll find one.\\u201d I\\u2019m digging through and looking for a silver one, but there aren\\u2019t any silver ones. I\\u2019m a little bummed because I want a silver one, not a gold one like the one she has on. In this same plastic container, there\\u2019s underwear and sports bras. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cThese are ones that I used to have, but I\\u2019m giving them away, if there\\u2019s anything in here that you would like.\\u201d I\\u2019m going through it and there\\u2019s nothing I like. They\\u2019re the wrong colors or the wrong style. So I leave it. Then the dream shifts. My friend Aila, who is part Native American, shows up in the dream with Audrey. We leave this garage area and walk out to her porch. Her kids are with us. But her son is sick - he\\u2019s not feeling well. We're all supposed to be getting in a car to go somewhere. We walk out the garage and we\\u2019re on a smaller porch. We\\u2019re looking out across a lot of land with cattle in the background, and to the right, a low and long building with corrugated roofing on the side that slants up - like half of a manufactured home. There\\u2019s also a pack of dogs, almost 10 of them. We\\u2019re sitting on the porch and it\\u2019s time for us to leave. Aila tells her kids to go get in the car, but her son is sick and they both go, but I\\u2019m like: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if he should be going with us. He\\u2019s not well. He could get something and get more sick. Or he could get other people sick.\\u201d Aila is sitting in a big wicker chair with a big round back - it\\u2019s her porch furniture. She takes her binoculars. We\\u2019re discussing whether or not her son should go. She says, \\u201cOh my god, every time I\\u2019m in a crisis point, or something like this happens, this dog always shows up. It\\u2019s name is Baxter.\\u201d So she\\u2019s looking through her binoculars and I look to the pack of dogs. The dogs are all different - big and small, all different colors and breeds. Sure enough, there's this dog that wasn\\u2019t there before. It has a bandana around its neck. I think that\\u2019s the one she\\u2019s talking about, but I don\\u2019t know because there are 10 different dogs and I haven\\u2019t seen any of them before. It seems very significant to her that this dog shows up any time something like this happens.\"],[\"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I\\u2019m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She\\u2019s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She\\u2019s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I\\u2019m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we\\u2019re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it\\u2019s men. We\\u2019re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila\\u2019s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We\\u2019re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it\\u2019s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I\\u2019m watching and I see Aila\\u2019s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it\\u2019s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I\\u2019m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it\\u2019s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it\\u2019s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It\\u2019s not quite a break wall because it doesn\\u2019t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I\\u2019m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He\\u2019s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They\\u2019re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It\\u2019s okay that they\\u2019re playing. I don\\u2019t have any concerns about who they\\u2019re playing with. I think that because I\\u2019m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They\\u2019re definitely working something out. I\\u2019m not concerned about that part at all. I\\u2019m just concerned that both children don\\u2019t drown. I\\u2019m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They\\u2019re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they\\u2019re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They\\u2019re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they\\u2019re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I\\u2019m watching this happen and by this time I\\u2019ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I\\u2019m concerned and don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. She says, \\u201cThe train was raided by these police officers.\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get to it. We weren\\u2019t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.\\u201d I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She\\u2019s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she\\u2019s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it\\u2019s the thing that she\\u2019s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a guy I know. In the dream, we\\u2019re together, maybe we\\u2019re dating. I have this feeling I\\u2019m trying to prove myself to him and that feels really gross. We\\u2019re together and he\\u2019s wanting to go from one island to the next. So we\\u2019re on the Big Island and trying to get to Maui. At least that\\u2019s the impression I have. But the setting doesn\\u2019t look like the islands I know. We are driving in a car and there's a baby in a car seat - I think it\\u2019s mine and his, but I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m trying to tell him how in the past, I had island hopped. I would take my car and drive it down this really long stretch of road and catch enough air to hop the channel - a very wide expanse of ocean between the islands. Somehow I\\u2019m trying to convince him I can do this. He\\u2019s very harsh. I\\u2019m trying to live up to expectations. It\\u2019s very strange because that is definitely not how I roll in real life. I\\u2019m driving the car to the place where I know we can catch enough air to ocean hop. We get to the end of the road - to this spot where I know I\\u2019ve done it before. There\\u2019s a huge wall rising up out of the ocean. It\\u2019s painted in colors of blue to look like the ocean. There\\u2019s actually ocean that comes over the top of it - water has been pumped over the top to make waterfalls. I\\u2019m shocked because it was definitely not there before. The times I had tried it, the road went off the edge of a cliff so you could catch some air. Now the road goes down and hits a shore. There's no way to catch enough air to get off of that and over this huge wall that\\u2019s now in front of us. I can feel that he is questioning me and what I\\u2019m telling him. He\\u2019s suspicious. I take the car and I get down to the bottom and see this is not happening. So I turn the car around. We head off to the right to an old dive bar. I say, \\u201cMaybe there\\u2019s somebody over there who can help us who\\u2019s done it before.\\u201d So we park and we go in. It\\u2019s totally dimly lit and smoky. The food is greasy and gross. We sit there and the woman who comes up to take our order reminds me of a friend of mine. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yea, I\\u2019ve figured out how to get over that wall. It takes certain skills and some special tools.\\u201d She\\u2019s also mad about something. She\\u2019s got revenge on the brain. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you how.\\u201d There are other people in this dive bar/diner breakfast place. They all look seedy and suspicious - rough around the edges. As this woman is talking to us, she\\u2019s super bitter and resentful. I can't tell if it\\u2019s because of where she works or the people she works with or what, but she\\u2019s definitely holding a grudge. She has her apron on and she\\u2019s holding her little notepad in her hand. We are trying to order some food and the baby is with us and sitting in its car seat - so strange because I can\\u2019t tell if this baby is mine or ours or what, but we\\u2019re taking care of it. She offers to go with us to get the car over the wall so we can go from one island to the next. It\\u2019s really important for us to go to Maui because I get the sense that it is a place where we will be free. So, she offers to go with us. Her and the ugy I\\u2019m with start hatching a plan and it\\u2019s kind of violent. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019ve gotta blow up this part of the wall.\\u201d So one of us has to swim under the waterfall part and plant these little grenades down low in the sand. I\\u2019m down iwth all of this, but another part of me is like, \\u201cthis is fucking insane. All of it is insane. What is going on?\\u201d We all get into the car. At this point other people have joined in on the plan. They are her people. So she is following us with these other people in a car, or maybe we\\u2019re following them. We\\u2019re heading back to that part where the road stops down near the ocean, but you can see the wall. She gets in the water with a knife and what I assume are grenades or something. A bunch of other guys she's with - her crew - get in the water. I see the guy I\\u2019m with get in the water. I\\u2019ve got the kid in the car. Then I\\u2019m also going in the water. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s watching the kid at this point. We all swim out to this wall. You can tell this wall was built by humans and it\\u2019s a tactic to keep us fenced or hedged in. Now all of us are totally intent on blowing up this wall. There\\u2019s still an edge of violence, anger and rage coming off the guy I was with. But now you can tell it\\u2019s a suicide mission for the woman and she\\u2019s giving up her life for this. Her crew - all the dudes she\\u2019s with - same. This has turned into some sort of \\u201cfor the greater good\\u201d cause. I\\u2019m treading water and don\\u2019t know how this is going to work. At this point I\\u2019m mostly watching because I don\\u2019t have an active role in bringing this down. I\\u2019m not quite sure what my partner is either, but he\\u2019s got an important part to play. All I can see is that the woman has died under the water. Before she dives under she says, \\u201cI hope this serves,\\u201d or something like that. I watch her dive under the water and she puts the grenades down at the bottom. The wall explodes and she explodes - actually, she disintegrates in front of me. Somehow I\\u2019m fine even though I\\u2019m in the water - I\\u2019ve backed up enough that this isn\\u2019t going to affect me. I watch a portion of the wall come down. Then me and the guy I\\u2019m with swim back to the car and we back way up the road in the car. He\\u2019s still like, \\u201cthis better work\\u201d and he\\u2019s going to blame it on me if it doesn\\u2019t. At this point, \\u201cI\\u2019m like, dude, you guys did all that crap. If it doesn\\u2019t work then I don\\u2019t know what to tell you.\\u201d But the urge to be free is really strong for both of us, so we\\u2019re both willing to try anyway, even though he seems completely ready to scapegoat me for whatever doesn\\u2019t happen. I\\u2019m a little pissed off about all that. So we back the car up all the way up and get as much speed as possible and somehow manage to launch over the broken part of the wall and make it to Maui. At this point, the dream completely shifts. Now I\\u2019m on the top of a hill. There\\u2019s a sports store where I\\u2019m working. Down below is another type of store - it looks like a UPS shipping center warehouse or something like that. To the left of that is a gym. I think I\\u2019m working in the sports warehouse store. I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie, but in some of the pictures, I\\u2019m naked from the waist down and in some of the pictures I\\u2019m completely naked and in some of the pictures I have all my clothes on. I have no idea what I\\u2019m doing or what that\\u2019s for, but apparently I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie to post on instagram. As I\\u2019m going back to work after this, I run into a friend - I think it\\u2019s an old classmate. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know you worked here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019ve worked here for a while. It\\u2019s a cool place to work.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cDid you know that our friend Levi works down at the shipping center?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t know he was down there. Sweet. One more person for me to sleep with!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, Kahenu works at this store with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I forgot that Kahenu was here. Awesome. One more person to sleep with!\\u201d This guy is pointing out to me all these people I know and I could sleep with. I\\u2019m totally stoked about it. Somehow, Jennifer Lopez shows up. She\\u2019s a fitness instructor for all the female employees. I\\u2019m watching her doing a workout and they\\u2019re all doing it with her. They\\u2019re all badass, totally kicking ass, covered in sweat from head to toe. They do have all their clothes on, but it\\u2019s bootie shorts and sports bras. For part of this workout, J Lo is in roller skates and some of it is coordinated because some of it is part of a music video. I watch them all working out, dripping sweat. Then she gets her roller skates and starts skating down the hill because this sports warehouse is at the top of the hill. All of these women, at least 25 if not more, are following her down the hill as part of this music video. I\\u2019m observing all of this and not making contact with all the people. I see Levi coming in and out of the building, but I don\\u2019t actually talk to him. I see Kahenu and start walking behind him. He turns around me and sees me and his eyes glaze over then get wide and he actually sees me, then he gets suspicious looking again. He turns around and keeps walking. I\\u2019m behind him and like, \\u201cHey you know me! Don\\u2019t pretend you don't know me.\\u201d Then the scene shifts one more time. I\\u2019m in a home, but now I\\u2019m in the observer role. I\\u2019m watching this woman who is pregnant with her third kid interact with the husband. The husband could give two fucking shit about her or the kids. She is trying so hard to engage him. She is being a super good mom. Her two little boys are probably 4 and 6 or maybe 5 and 3. They\\u2019re a little bit of a handful. She\\u2019s maybe 8 or 9 months pregnant and definitely putting on a persona of the cheerful, happy, bubbly wife. She\\u2019s also really, really short, maybe 4\\u20198 or 9 - not that much taller than her kiddos. Her husband is going off to work and she\\u2019s saying, \\u201cHey, have a nice day, honey!\\u201d His face is glued to his phone. I can tell that he\\u2019s on the phone texting a mistress or scrolling through pictures of other women. I have judgment around it. I\\u2019m also watching her trying to keep him engaged, and he\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYup, yup, going to work, bye, see you later.\\u201d I see him leaving and her trying to engage her two sons in play and learning like a home or unschooling situation.\"],[\"I\\u2019m heading home to the home I grew up in on the Big Island of Hawaii. I\\u2019m in a car. There are people with me, I think my siblings. It\\u2019s pouring rain - the kind where the roads are flooding. To get into the street that turns onto my cul-de-sac, we go over a stream. The stream is directly under the road but has come up over the road. I have to park the car. The siblings in the car are with me, but we\\u2019re not interacting - they\\u2019re kind of shadowed in the background. I have to get across the water to get into the cul-de-sac, so the car is parked. There are all these road workers here to help us. I get out and they\\u2019re very specific in showing me how to cross it. They\\u2019re going to help me get over it. They say, \\u201cThis part right here is deeper because the water has worn so much of the road away. But we\\u2019ve put some rocks down right here for you to walk across.\\u201d I get the sense that there\\u2019s also a small child with me because I\\u2019m being extra careful because I have to help them get across, too. I think it\\u2019s actually my son. The workers help us across this water and it is pretty deep, but because the rocks are there, it only goes up to our knees. Then we cross over and get onto the road. It stops raining and there\\u2019s no more water, but it is wet. We walk past a neighbor\\u2019s house. They have strawberry guava growing in their yard and it\\u2019s ripe. So I stop and I pick a bunch to eat and a bunch to take with me to save for later or turn into jam or jelly. I show my son and he\\u2019s eating some of them. We continue down the road. We walk down the road a little bit and turn right to head down the street to my house. So, we\\u2019re walking that way. We\\u2019ve hit the end where there\\u2019s a stop sign and we\\u2019re turning down to the right. To the left, I can see the horse pasture my friend used to have her horses in. I am recognizing all the houses and am like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m home, I\\u2019m home!\\u201d It feels good and normal. Then I\\u2019m walking down the street to our house. It\\u2019s different. Now my brothers have shown up. I don't think my sister is there, but we haven\\u2019t interacted yet. We get to the house. The house is different. The first thing we do is we all go into the backyard to see the stream because the stream we grew up with was such an important part of our lives, but we\\u2019d heard that our neighbor Andy had dug out his side of the stream. We get there and I look at it. The far side is a big wall that he dug out. It used to be that you could walk down the slope of our backyard into the stream and you could cross it to the other side and on the other side was a hill. There was a cow pasture and a barbed wire on the other side that you would have to cross, then walk up this hill or ridge. At the top you could see far out to a lava desert. But now, in the dream, that hill doesn\\u2019t exist. It\\u2019s just a rock wall. Instead of being flat where you could see the layers, it\\u2019s pebbled - you see this sometimes when you dig out all the layers of rock. The rocks are round and stacked on top of each other. They\\u2019re jutting out of the wall. My brothers are really sad that it\\u2019s been dug out. But I think it\\u2019s beautiful and also say, \\u201cOh my god, I dreamt about this. I dreamt this happened to the stream.\\u201d It\\u2019s created caves on the far side underneath the wall and I think it looks beautiful now. But my siblings are really upset. We turn around and it\\u2019s time to go into the house. My mom and dad are there, but the house has been changed. They live in separate parts of the house - my mom lives in the big part. Somehow there\\u2019s a sidewalk or the road is in between or underneath forming a causeway, and you have to cross the causeway to the part where my dad lives. My mom and dad are kind of getting along. They\\u2019re a little snippy with each other. But it\\u2019s clear that my mom never goes into my dad\\u2019s side. You have to go up these stairs and then walk across this causeway and it opens up into a room that\\u2019s above everything. The room looks like an attic and there\\u2019s enough stuff that it could be an attic. There are all these paintings, photographs and pictures nailed to the wall. What sticks out in my mind is that this little causeway I walk over is just plywood placed over a bunch of joists and it\\u2019s not particularly safe and the thought crosses my mind, \\u201cOh my dad is old and he shouldn\\u2019t be walking on this kind of floor where you have to walk on the joists so the plywood doesn\\u2019t tip up at the corners and come off.\\u201d It seems strange to me. My brothers are with me and we\\u2019re all going. Now my friend Dorian, who I grew up in this neighborhood, is with us, too. He\\u2019s there and keeps asking all these poignant questions. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to help me and my parents reconcile. That\\u2019s his role. He has a very loving presence. My whole life he had a loving presence, always very kind. This is radiating from him. So I look at this place where my dad is living. He says, \\u201cDo you like it? Do you like the way it\\u2019s decorated?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at all of these pictures. The walls are made of plywood and not painted, so the pictures are fading into the backaryd. There are all these pictures of ships and oceans with clouds over the top, like old-fashioned oil paintings. For whatever reason, the colors used for all three paintings match the same shades and tones of the plywood walls and they\\u2019re fading into the background. So I look at him and say, \\u201cIf you paint just this section with all the paintings white, you\\u2019ll be able to see the paintings better.\\u201d He crosses his arms in the way he used to and puts one hand up to his mouth and does the thing he used to do - stop and think and nod for a little bit. Then he moves out of the picture. Now my mom is front and center. We\\u2019re in the same space, but now the space has transformed and it\\u2019s hers. So my dad is there, but it\\u2019s not his space anymore. She has work to do. She always had work to do when we were growing up. There\\u2019s a computer on a desk that\\u2019s now in this space and piles of paperwork. But she also has piles of makeup. She says, \\u201cOh I have to get to a trial. Doyou think you can help me look good for this trial?\\u201d When I was growing up, I always thought my mom did her makeup so shitty because she never changed the way she did it from the 60s - weird blue eyeshadow and clumpy mascara. She just didn\\u2019t have a lot of skill with her makeup. So in the dream, she\\u2019s asking me to do it, because she knows I know how to do makeup. I\\u2019m looking at all this makeup she has. She has ten or twelve of the exact same eyeshadows and lip creams and all these things she wouldn\\u2019t wear because they are way too bright - they\\u2019re not the right color. She also has this makeup brush I need to use. So I put all this foundation on her face to smooth out her skin. It\\u2019s thick and way too much. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMom, if you\\u2019re going to have me do this, y0ou need to trust me and let me rub this in.\\u201d So I take this brush and I\\u2019m trying to rub it in. She\\u2019s sort of fighting me about it and I\\u2019m getting exasperated. I say, \\u201cStop, let me do this. You asked me to do this. Stop.\\u201d My friend Darisu is there and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, let her do this. You\\u2019re going to have to trust her to rub the makeup in.\\u201d I finally get her face to be a blank slate with all the foundation. It takes a while with this one brush. In the meantime I ask her why she has twelve of this one compact. She looks at my dad and says, \\u201cWell, he was trying to order me a surprise, but he ordered like twelve of them and now I have twelve of these things I never use.\\u201d In my head, I think, \\u201cThat was always your relationship. He was always trying to do nice, kind things for you, but he got it wrong by just a little bit. It would have been lovely if he had ordered the right amount and the right shade of these compacts, but instead he ordered twelve of a color you can never use. But instead of you communicating to him that you didn\\u2019t like that, you just got annoyed with him, rolled your eyes and totally disrespected him.\\u201dIn the dream, I\\u2019m watching that dynamic play out. I want out of it. It\\u2019s not my business. I can tell it\\u2019s them. I was thinking it was just her normal hoarding habits, but it turns out it came from my dad, at least in this aspect of the dream. We go to where her eyeshadows are because it\\u2019s time for me to do her eyes. She has a ton of different colors. I know that is actually her. In this part, she just wanted all of these things for herself. So I pick out an eyeshadow. What\\u2019s fascinating is I pick out this blue that is dark blue glitter, drag queen style. She\\u2019s looking at me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cJust trust me.\\u201d So I goto put it on and she keeps flinching and moving out of the way. Dorian tells her, \\u201cYou have to hold still. You have to trust her. Let her do this.\\u201d In the meantime, I\\u2019m concentrating so hard to put this eyeshadow on her and make her look nice, I get the sense that we\\u2019re running out of time because she has to hurry up and get to the trial. There\\u2019s also a part when we had gone into the house, there were a couple of cats. These cats are small like house cats but their fur looks like a cheetah - wild cats - and there\\u2019s one here. I\\u2019m talking to it and looking at it. It\\u2019s talking back as a sentient guide in this dream. It\\u2019s acting like a human. It\\u2019s got a pink underlayer. It\\u2019s fur is almost holographic, so it turns pink when it moves, but it still has the cheetah spots. I look up and there\\u2019s this cat print or motif in this attic/annex that she\\u2019s in that has all her makeup, work desk and other stuff. It\\u2019s very striking to me, because at one point in the dream, the cat wants to be held. I\\u2019m holding and petting it, but it\\u2019s purring and chewing on my finger and telling me stories. When I\\u2019m doing my mom\\u2019s makeup, I see this cat print everywhere - on the pillows, the wall, upholstering of a chair. She\\u2019s wearing some, too. I finally finished with her makeup and am not sure if this looks good because she wouldn't let me do it the way I wanted to do. But she\\u2019s gotta go. She says thank you and goes off to the trial. Then the dream changes completely and I\\u2019m with a friend. She\\u2019s a business coach. She takes me to one of her client\\u2019s houses and her client is doing quite well and so is the client\\u2019s husband because they live in a really nice house. I can see the ocean out of the windows and off the balcony of their house. The inside is very modern looking and minimalist, so there\\u2019s not a lot in it in contrast to my parents\\u2019 house. There are beautiful wood floors and tall walls with tall windows. The walls are painted grey and the furniture is black. It\\u2019s all elegant, very understated and minimalistic. There\\u2019s a gathering of people because this woman is telling her story of how she got to be a wealthy business woman. I\\u2019m in the audience. She talks about how hard she works and how she couldn\\u2019t have done it without my friend who is the business coach. Then the business coach says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you talk with Cinnamon?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m talking with this woman and her husband. They want to know what I do and how I got to what I\\u2019m doing. I tell the whole story of all the different aspects of my life that came together to this point of where I\\u2019m a priestess who helps people be in their bodies and how that happened through me getting a degree in exercise science and nutrition. She says, \\u201cOh, your story is very similar to mine. The only difference is I\\u2019m making a ton of money.\\u201dI look at her and am like, \\u201cYup, I just haven\\u2019t cracked that money thing yet. Haven\\u2019t figured that out.\\u201d My coach is like, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m having you meet her and tell the story because i wanted you to see how exactly similar the two of you are. You could do it at any point.\\u201d The husband was listening to the story and very supportive. Both of them are people of color. She may be Asian and he could maybe have some Arab blood. In the meantime, I can hear and see the ocean. It\\u2019s gotten stormy outside and there\\u2019s whitecaps on the water. But even though the house is very close to the edge of the water, I feel safe. I\\u2019m not too worried about the water coming up, but I can see it spraying up on the windows, which is very interesting. There\\u2019s a seagull outside trying to find a place to nest and land out of the wind. This is happening while she is telling her story and I am telling my story. Then at some point, I am sitting down. There is a sense of magic in this dream - as if these two people are my guides or my guides are orchestrating it or there are guides in the audience. I turn from our conversation and to a computer. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019ve been having conversations with other people. I look at the screen and see my friend Maria. She and I are having a flirtation through the computer screen. I can\\u2019t remember all the things we said, but I get the feeling of space and distance between us that is happening in real life - we are no longer friends in real life. I\\u2019m asking her, \\u201cWhere are you? Why aren\\u2019t we friends? Why aren\\u2019t we hanging out together?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember her response. Also, somewhere in the dream, I\\u2019m having a conversation with my dad and he\\u2019s talking about Doug who is a guy who used to work for my mom. They have a condo that they bought together with somebody else. My dad keeps saying that Doug owes him money for the condo. I keep saying, \\u201cNobody has any money. What are you going to do about it?\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cWell the option has always been that he can pay money or do somworktrade to live there and his roommate can pay money.\\u201d I find it interesting that work trade is on the table as an option for living in this condo.\"],[\"I am with a young man in his late teens or early twenties. We\\u2019re in a hotel room. I\\u2019m switching between observer and in the dream. I\\u2019m younger, closer to his age, and I think we\\u2019re involved. I\\u2019m lying on the hotel bed. It\\u2019s almost like we\\u2019re trying to earn our freedom from a mafia-type organization. We have a chaperone, an older matronly woman who reminds me of my mom, who has the adjoining bedroom. There\\u2019s another man who comes in - he is the head of the mafia. He\\u2019s saying to the young man I\\u2019m with, \\u201cYou have to prove your worth and your smarts to get out of the contract you owe the mafia for your freedom and ability to be with her (me) and to choose.\\u201d This is the part where I move into the observer role. I\\u2019m watching as this young man performs his first task. He has to orchestrate something where he can sneak away and not be caught. There are other people who are loyal to the boss watching him, on one hand to support him in getting away, and on the other hand to stop him and report him to the boss. It\\u2019s very interesting - an initiation and test where the people involved are both rooting for this young man and going to stop him at any cost. So now we\\u2019re outside the bedroom and I\\u2019m watching him in what looks like a mall or airport bathroom with lots of stalls and entrances on two sides. He\\u2019s in there and trying to grab a pair of shoes to be able to get away. There are lockers and in one of the lockers are the mafia boss\\u2019 shoes - a very specific pair of shoes, white and made of hard plastic material. They are very precious to the boss. This younger man is trying to get them because if he can get those shoes and the car, he will have passed the test. I\\u2019m watching him plan and be very sneaky and strategic. He\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cThe henchmen patrol this area at this time, so if I time it this way, I\\u2019ll miss their patrol and be able to grab these shoes.\\u201d I watch him plan it and then he does it. The boss knows that it\\u2019s going down but is letting it happen. He\\u2019s observing this whole thing, because he knows the kid needs to prove himself. So the young man does get the shoes and rescue me from wherever I was - maybe I was left in the hotel room. We run off together and then the dream shifts completely. Now it\\u2019s just me. I\\u2019m in a room - it looks like an abandoned warehouse you\\u2019d find in the industrial area. There are a bunch of millenials, or maybe even younger, maybe twenty year olds. There are two groups. I\\u2019m in there with all these kids. One group only has a handful of the younger kids. They are very conservative, kind of in shadow and wearing darker clothes, and their mannerisms are very reserved. The other group is much bigger with all kinds of people - all skin colors, ethnicities, gender identities or non-identifications, wearing various states of clothing or not. It is literally the gamut of young people. I\\u2019m standing with this group. There\\u2019s not a lot of distance between these two groups, maybe 10 feet, but I\\u2019m definitely standing with the group with all the diversity. They\\u2019re really loud and energetic. They are essentially all extraverts. While I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes! I like being with these high energy sovereign people,\\u201d I\\u2019m also overwhelmed by the sheer amount of energy each one is putting off. They are doing what they\\u2019re doing, no questions asked. It\\u2019s surprising to me because I know how to shield my own energy, but I\\u2019m just being swamped by the exuberance of this group who is celebrating who they are. I love this and I\\u2019m very clear that out of the two groups, I\\u2019m aligned with the group that knows who they are and isn\\u2019t taking any shit. But I also feel I need a little space. In this warehouse, they\\u2019re dancing, jumping around and making merry. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh! Too much! Overwhelm!\\u201d The dream shifts. This time I\\u2019m part of the dream and also observing. There\\u2019s an actor, Zachary Levi from \\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\u201d show. We\\u2019re in a room together. We\\u2019re sitting at a table and being served food in the warehouse. He\\u2019s been given a plate of rice stir fry and he\\u2019s eating it and thinking it\\u2019s okay. I\\u2019m tasting it, too, and say, \\u201cYeah, this is pretty good.\\u201d But there\\u2019s this cream of mushroom or salmon chowder option available. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cI like this one better.\\u201d He\\u2019s talking to someone who is the one organizing the food coming out on these tables. When he makes his preference, the person that\\u2019s been bringing the food out is really short and snippy. It\\u2019s a man chef. He\\u2019s not taking kindly to Levi\\u2019s preference even though he made both of these meals. Levi is just very innocently expressing his preference for this other soup. I\\u2019m mostly in the observer role here and not really interacting except to say once or twice, \\u201cNo, I actually also like that other soup better.\\u201d Then this is where the dream shifts again. I need to see my acupuncturist. It\\u2019s not that I\\u2019m not feeling well. I just know I need a few adjustments and an attunement of sorts. So my acupuncturist is the person I\\u2019m going to see. I\\u2019m going to get needles and he\\u2019s also a naturopath so I know that he\\u2019s got some other remedies and things up his sleeve and he\\u2019ll know exactly how to do the attunement. So I go to see him and I\\u2019m in his office - it\\u2019s him and his wife who is the receptionist. They\\u2019re diagnosing me and I\\u2019m telling them my symptoms, though I\\u2019m not sick. We\\u2019re in conversation. He and his wife confer a little bit. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, I think she needs this.\\u201d The naturopath says, \\u201cOkay, so here\\u2019s this one room where you can get ready, then meet me in this other room where I have all the equipment.\\u201d In the first room I have to take off all my clothes like you do for acupuncture. But usually you\\u2019re in the same room and you get under the blanket. In this case, I\\u2019m in one room, take off all my clothes, then walk to the other room totally naked. I don\\u2019t question it at all. I get to the other room and the naturopath says, \\u201cOkay, we need you to lay down here.\\u201d Instead of a treatment table, it\\u2019s a black futon couch, like every college student has ever had. It\\u2019s not laid out. It\\u2019s in the couch position. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure this is going to be very comfortable, but I\\u2019ll lay down here.\\u201d I lay down and the naturopath starts to put little nodes connected to wires on me. I can see my breasts and there are nodes on my breasts and I\\u2019m clear it\\u2019s for my heart. I\\u2019m starting to feel tired. He asks, \\u201cAre you comfortable?\\u201d He\\u2019s finished and is going to leave the room. I realize I want a blanket over me. I say, \\u201cNo, I want the blanket I came with. I brought a blanket that this hand-quilted. It\\u2019s all folded up and left it in the other room because I didn\\u2019t know I was going to need it. I really want that.\\u201d At this point, there are other people in the room, again these are younger people, maybe early twenties, maybe older teenagers. They\\u2019re observing. They are part of this healing attunement. I can see three of them and I get a sense that there\\u2019s more. They\\u2019re talking to the doctor and saying \\u201cPlease do a good job with her. We honor her very much and she needs to be taken care of. Don\\u2019t mess it up or put any needles in the wrong spot.\\u201d They\\u2019re very honoring in the way they speak of me, like I\\u2019ve done things for them that has helped them, and in return they want to make sure that I\\u2019m taken care of. So when I ask for my blanket, one of them goes back to get my blanket. They end up getting the wrong one, but it\\u2019s okay. I\\u2019m slowly being taken care of. They find the heat lamp and put it on me. They put a blanket on me. They just make sure that while I\\u2019m having this attunement, I\\u2019m warm and have everything I need. I leave the office feeling better. I\\u2019m looking at this house. It\\u2019s twilight The feature of the house that stands out the most is a huge front window that is lit up. I can see the light in this gloom that I\\u2019m in.\"],[\"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He\\u2019s very protective. I\\u2019m lying down on my back. I can\\u2019t tell where I am. There\\u2019s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I\\u2019m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I\\u2019m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I\\u2019m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it\\u2019s the time of coronavirus, people can\\u2019t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They\\u2019re gathered around me and I\\u2019m definitely still vulnerable because I\\u2019m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I\\u2019m telling them: \\u201cMy playlists are for pole classes. It\\u2019s not your normal CrossFit playlist.\\u201d They don\\u2019t care. They\\u2019re adamant that they get a workout. So, it\\u2019s either the man I\\u2019m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It\\u2019s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren\\u2019t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, \\u201cOkay, the winners get some of these ferrets.\\u201d During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s my kids or somebody else\\u2019s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I\\u2019m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they\\u2019re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn\\u2019t going to be what they thought. I\\u2019m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There\\u2019s this process I\\u2019m going through where I\\u2019m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they\\u2019re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can\\u2019t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they\\u2019re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I\\u2019m in the observer role. There\\u2019s a man and his son - I don\\u2019t know who they are. He\\u2019s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he\\u2019s very attentive. They\\u2019re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I\\u2019m not very neutral. I\\u2019m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it\\u2019s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he\\u2019s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, \\u201cWe need to take your son.\\u201d The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I\\u2019m fucking pissed. There\\u2019s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it\\u2019s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he\\u2019s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they\\u2019re basically not listening - they\\u2019re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man\\u2019s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that\\u2019s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a lead up to this scene, but it\\u2019s escaping me. It was connected because it set me up for the emotions. What I do remember is being in a room. I\\u2019m in charge of making a meal for these children that are coming in. It\\u2019s a soccer clinic and all of these younger children are a part of it. It\\u2019s a mix of boys and girls and I think they\\u2019re all between the ages of 8 and 12. I\\u2019m supposed to be preparing the food, but also making sure there\\u2019s enough for everyone. There\\u2019s probably 50 kids coming through to eat. I\\u2019m working on it. The deadline is getting closer for the time I need to have the food prepared. It\\u2019s not totally prepared. There\\u2019s an interesting piece happening here where I have a basket of feathers - they could be chicken and raven feathers. I am taking the feathers and sewing them one at a time onto this food and it makes the food more abundant. So, I\\u2019m full on doing spells here - totally witchy. I\\u2019m realizing I\\u2019m running out of time, though. This man I know comes in. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll help you get this fixed up.\\u201d He comes in. His energy is very jarring to me. He grabs a bunch of feathers, and instead of helping make the food more abundant, he starts on this art project with the feathers. He\\u2019s talking the whole time - fucking windbag taking us so much air and space. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe need to listen to this music,\\u2019 and he puts this music on. It\\u2019s kind of jazzy and reminds me of the band Pink Martini from Portland. He is ruining the flow and I don\\u2019t like it. Now I\\u2019m really not getting things done. The thing is he\\u2019s so earnest and he thinks he\\u2019s helping. But of course, my self-reflection is, oh why do you have to be a bitch about it? But he\\u2019s not fucking helping. And he\\u2019s just taking up so much space and hijacking it. The kids start to come in now. The food is not ready. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay kids! We\\u2019ve got plenty here!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cWe barely have enough to feed the ten that just showed up and there\\u2019s going to be forty more coming.\\u201d So the first ten come in, get their food and they\\u2019re eating what they have. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is fucked. I don\\u2019t have the rest of everything I need.\\u201d The magic spell was like fishes and loaves - I was making more food out of the food we had - and now I don\\u2019t have any more of the food base material to make more food with. So more children come in. They\\u2019re sitting at tables with their plates. They had to go to their spot, grab their plate, walk to the buffet line, then fill up their plate. Now all these kids have their plates, but their plates are empty and they\\u2019re looking at me. All that\\u2019s left are mashed sweet potatoes or yams. They\\u2019re looking at me and the bacon is all gone - the meat/protein is gone. There\\u2019s not other vegetables. It\\u2019s just this bit of sweet potatoes and there\\u2019s not enough for the kids that come in. They\\u2019re staring at me and I have the worst sinking feeling in my stomach because I can\\u2019t feed the kids. It\\u2019s because my super efficient and effective ways of making food stretch and last just got hijacked by this dude. I wake up feeling completely fucking irritated.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with some friends - one or two are high school friends, but some are co-workers. I\\u2019m at a grocery store and we\\u2019re stocking shelves and cleaning up. We\\u2019re in the breakroom, too. We have to clean up the store to prepare it for the next day. There\\u2019s an interesting split between how much the men and women are cleaning up. The work is getting done, but the small details keep getting missed by the men and the women clean up after them. The dream shifts a little bit out of the grocery store to another room, maybe a home because there\\u2019s a home office and what looks like a home entertainment room. I\\u2019m watching a man who is a BDSM trainer and you can book sessions with him. There\\u2019s also a gorgeous super curvy black woman and it\\u2019s her birthday. Her husband has booked a session with this pornstar BDSM trainer. His name is King Noire. She\\u2019s so freaking excited and it\\u2019s so cute to see her exclaim, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m going to get hit with a paddle!\\u201d She\\u2019s really excited that this is her birthday gift and her husband is excited for her, too. Now we\\u2019re in what looks like an underground garage. She\\u2019s in some short shorts with a skirt over top and a regular top on. She\\u2019s walking down a ramp. There are other people getting ready for the scene. She\\u2019s so excited. She drops her purse and when she goes to pick up her skirt, it rides up. She\\u2019s wearing shorts, so you can\\u2019t see anything, but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my!\\u201d Her husband is standing behind her. You can tell she is nervous and excited at the same time, but doesn\\u2019t know which way to go with it. So she heads down the ramp and disappears into the darkness of this underground garage. I think this is perfect and she\\u2019s getting what she needs. I\\u2019m observing that part. Then I become part of the dream. Now it\\u2019s me and it\\u2019s my birthday. The whole tone of the dream changes. I\\u2019m with the person - but they\\u2019re not actually King, the BDSM expert. I can\\u2019t tell the person\\u2019s face, but they\\u2019re a tall, muscular and strong male. There are other men around. Whoever I am with, he and I are flirting and he\\u2019s telling me he\\u2019s going to treat me good on my birthday. We\\u2019re in the entertainment center part of the house. There\\u2019s a huge movie projector and a movie playing and there are some really comfy big seats. He\\u2019s sitting in one of them and I\\u2019m sitting on his lap. Now the dream starts to feel weird because I\\u2019m watching these other men in this room with women - they\\u2019re chasing the women. It reminds me of scenes where you see a satyr chasing nymphs. But there\\u2019s an edge of danger that it may not be consensual. I see someone in front of me cracking a whip. I turn to the person whose lap I\\u2019m sitting on and ask, \\u201cDid you bring one of those for my birthday?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh yeah, don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay!\\u201d He\\u2019s tending me to give me what I want and he has his own desires but is holding them in check - I can feel it. There\\u2019s another scene where things start to shift. Now instead of being in this entertainment movie room, all of a sudden we\\u2019re in a different room. I feel like a sacrificial offering. Now King is there in the room. He\\u2019s sitting in front of a computer at a desk and I can\\u2019t tell if he\\u2019s editing film. I can see out a bunch of windows to skyscrapers - a city. I come up to him, put my arms around him and tell him, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m going to be okay.\\u201d He clenches his jaw and starts to pretend to headbutt people three times. He\\u2019s really tense and he\\u2019s gripping the computer mouse. His whole body is really tense. I ask, \\u201cAre you worried about me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, and I know you\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d I say again, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time for me to head down to this underground parking lot. King is walking me down the ramp. I go from light into the dark. He has to stop at a certain point, and now it\\u2019s just me going forward from this point on. Now the dream gets a little funny. It\\u2019s still me. There\\u2019s a group of men - all white men and their faces are covered and they\\u2019re wearing all black. They kind of look like the Ku Klux Klan, but they have black instead of white. There is leather and chains and spikes and a lot of weapons - knives, rope and chains. This is the part where I pop out. Now I\\u2019m watching myself. They\\u2019ve formed a semicircle and I\\u2019m walking down into the middle. They grab this material with straps and loops for their hands. They come around me in a circle and take this material. They open it up - it was folded like an accordian. When they open it up, it circles around me. I am enclosed in this darkness - this black fabric material that looks like a set of bat wings, but their hands are through the loops and they are closing it. That\\u2019s the last bit of the dream I see - myself being enclosed in this thing. I can feel King or my Lover behind me is tense and not okay with it. But this is something I\\u2019m supposed to be doing - being a sacrifice. There will be pain, but it is consensual. But there is an edge of darkness as it is not a consensus between two people, but there are larger forces at play. King keeps acting like it\\u2019s out of his control.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know from waking life, but in the dream I recognize them as co-workers. We\\u2019re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they\\u2019re working. I work there, too, but I\\u2019m there on my day off. We\\u2019re talking. I\\u2019m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I\\u2019m barefoot and I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There\\u2019s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don\\u2019t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I\\u2019m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There\\u2019s some other way that I\\u2019m helping these co-workers. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an energetic helping or if I\\u2019m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They\\u2019re both younger women. I\\u2019m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn\\u2019t super clear. I just know I\\u2019m in the store with them and we\\u2019re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I\\u2019m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I\\u2019ve been hanging out with say, \\u201cOh, we have something for you.\\u201d All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we\\u2019re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There\\u2019s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don\\u2019t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, \\u201cWe have these shoes for you.\\u201d These boots are pretty incredible. They\\u2019re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I \\u2018m looking at these boots, the heel doesn\\u2019t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It\\u2019s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I\\u2019m so, so tall. I love them and they\\u2019re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I\\u2019m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re that tall in those shoes. That\\u2019s how tall you are. That\\u2019s who you are.\\u201d But I\\u2019m surprised. I didn\\u2019t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I\\u2019ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There\\u2019s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It\\u2019s an interesting mix because we\\u2019re in quarantine and we can\\u2019t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I\\u2019m thinking that for someone who\\u2019s never driven a huge tour bus before, he\\u2019s doing a pretty good job. I don\\u2019t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I\\u2019m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it\\u2019s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I\\u2019m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I\\u2019m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it\\u2019s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren\\u2019t going to tip him. I say, \\u201cYou have to tip him. That\\u2019s how this works.\\u201d I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it\\u2019s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I\\u2019m not stoked to be there. I\\u2019m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there\\u2019s stuff everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I\\u2019m somewhere I don\\u2019t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There\\u2019s definitely friction here. I\\u2019m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.\"],[\"There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I\\u2019m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I\\u2019m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It\\u2019s showing up in flashes. There\\u2019s one part where I\\u2019m in an airport. I\\u2019m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It\\u2019s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don\\u2019t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It\\u2019s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I\\u2019m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There\\u2019s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I\\u2019m sorting of chatting with. I\\u2019m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I\\u2019m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that\\u2019s happened. I can\\u2019t find my sweater. We\\u2019ve landed and it\\u2019s time to disembark but I can\\u2019t find my sweater. I\\u2019ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we\\u2019ve landed and I\\u2019m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can\\u2019t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn\\u2019t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn\\u2019t look quite human. So, there\\u2019s this sense that I\\u2019m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don\\u2019t want to be because I don\\u2019t know where I am. I get on a tram. It\\u2019s more like a train that will take us to our destination. I feel out of place. I don\\u2019t know where I am - this place is new, this tram is new, I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going. Even though I\\u2019m part of this group, I don\\u2019t know all the people around me, It\\u2019s just a little uncomfortable and I feel disoriented. Then I come out of that part of the dream into another part where my ex\\u2019s presence is around. He\\u2019s not in the dream with me, but he\\u2019s been around. We\\u2019ve definitely been divorced. I\\u2019m agitated because he\\u2019s pulled more super controlling shit. I\\u2019m just wanting so badly to get away from this person, to get out from under his thumb, to not have to interact with him in any way. In the dream he does have the kids. It\\u2019s just me in the dream, but there\\u2019s a sense of him being around with the kids. I feel like I\\u2019m under surveillance as if he has cameras on me. I don\\u2019t even know where I am. I think it\\u2019s a house, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave the house and go out into town. There\\u2019s a building that is a retail shop. Things are sold out of it, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure what. I need to go there because there\\u2019s a desk that I\\u2019m trying to fix. What\\u2019s interesting is my dad shows up. The front of the retail shop is all these floor to ceiling windows. A lot of them have been broken - someone was throwing bottles or rocks. There\\u2019s glass everywhere in the entry area. I need to go in. I know this shop is owned by my ex and his father. There\\u2019s something about a desk that I need to get or repair. Or I need to get something from that shop. My dad is there and trying to sweep up all the broken glass. My dad is actually part owner of the shop, or maybe he owns the land that the shop is on. I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s super ineffective with his broom, so I just grab a broom and start sweeping. Between the two of us we get the glass picked up. The glass is in tiny, tiny pieces - not quite sand, but pebble size. It didn't break in big chunks - it broke like safety glass into little round pieces without sharp edges. The entryway is paved in cobblestone, so the glass is getting stuck in the grooves. We sweep up all the glass and I don\\u2019t know what we do with it. I go inside the retail shop and walk in through one of the broken windows rather than the door. There\\u2019s the desk that I need. I go to pick it up and move it and it just falls apart. I look underneath and the structure of it is crumbling. It\\u2019s like that really thin pressed board that cheap furniture is made out of and if it gets wet, it swells and disintegrates. It\\u2019s made of that stuff. I\\u2019m underneath the desk and trying to fix it. I ask my dad for help. He hands me a roll of duct tape. I try to duct tape it back together. I\\u2019m working on it and wondering why I\\u2019m trying to fix this desk. It\\u2019s my ex\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t want it, why am I fixing his shit? This desk is not going to provide what I need and is not the thing that I actually need. I come up from under the desk and there are other sturdy pieces of furniture made of real wood. I can see them and I\\u2019m comparing them to this desk. I have this sense of, \\u201cOh god, please make sure that my ex or his dad do not show up at this shop while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I have their permission, but don\\u2019t want to interact with them and their super controlling, contemptuous attitudes of disgust. I know I don\\u2019t want to be there when they arrive, so I\\u2019m trying to hurry.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I see a customer that I see often in waking realm. He\\u2019s there, too. It\\u2019s time for me to get off work. I\\u2019m leaving and he\\u2019s checking out with his groceries. I get in my car - it\\u2019s a Jeep with the top of. He gets in his car. We end up driving next to each other in our cars. It\\u2019s weird that the road is wide enough for us both because it\\u2019s a two-lane highway. Somehow the lane we\\u2019re in is wide enough for both of us to be driving side by side. I\\u2019m kind of like, \\u201cCome on dude, let me get in front, or let me get behind. I don\\u2019t want to be driving side by side with you.\\u201d We end up driving toward the same place. It\\u2019s a gated community where he lives. For some reason, I\\u2019m going with him. His face looks like the classic bad guy in martial arts movies. In fact, I think he looks a lot like an actor. His face is heavy brow, heavy jaw, very square, heavy nose that looks like it\\u2019s been broken a few times. I\\u2019m not attracted in any way. We roll up onto this gated community. It looks like it has a bunch of duplexes in it. We roll through the gate. There\\u2019s a school - a college campus of sorts - too. I park my car and feel like I\\u2019m going to head into school or into my home. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, get in. I\\u2019m going to give you a ride.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t need a ride anywhere.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m going to drive you someplace.\\u201d Part of me is like, \\u201cFuck no, I don\\u2019t want to get in a car with you.\\u201d The other part of me is like, \\u201cOh okay, I guess we\\u2019ll see where we\\u2019re going with this.\\u201d I hop in and we\\u2019re driving around. He starts telling me about his kids. We had a conversation at the grocery store about his children. I had watched him while I was at the grocery store. I was shopping, too, and it wasn\\u2019t my place of work. I had been people watching, specifically parents, and watching the way they talked to their children and noticing that parents are so controlling and rude and disrespectful of their children and didn\\u2019t let children be who they wanted me to be. I remember watching him specifically and he was really harsh and militant with his kids and I was like, \\u201cOh my god, you\\u2019re squishing their light.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t say it out loud, but I remember thinking that. I was not impressed with the way he was parenting. I think that was my hesitation when we ended up driving next to each other, side by side. So, I got in the car anway, and we ended up talking about parenting in the car. He was driving all around this gated community and there was snow everywhere. Then he parks in some place. There's this weird potential of a sexual thing. I\\u2019m so grossed out about it. I can feel the bile rising in my throat when I think about it. He puts music on so we can dance, like he\\u2019s going to try and maybe seduce me with dancing. I\\u2019m so not having it at all. This younger woman comes out of one of the buildings we parked near. She - her skin - is all gold. She begins dancing to the music. I\\u2019m dancing to the music by myself - I\\u2019m trying to keep space between me and this dude. She\\u2019s beautiful to watch dancing. I\\u2019m loving the dancing, too. He starts to creep up on her and I\\u2019m trying to tell her to get away from him and don\\u2019t let him come up and steal your gold your light. He tries to touch her and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw, no, get away!\\u201d I think she eventually moves away and off into the background. He doesn\\u2019t ever actually get to touch her, which is good. It\\u2019s now just he and me again. We get back in the car because he goes to drop me off somewhere. He does this crazy thing where he slams on the gas and then lets off the gas and he turns the car so we\\u2019re sliding. It looks and feels like a move from the movies where you see a car changing direction really fast. He goes to drop me off near my car. Now instead of it being my car, it\\u2019s a rack of bicycles that you\\u2019d found in a complex full of college kids who have only bikes to get themselves around. He drops me off there like that\\u2019s my car. I\\u2019m annoyed because it is so not my car and my car is far away from where we are. Instead, it ends up being his house. I go into the house and he goes to park his Jeep car thing. I go into the house and there\\u2019s a bunch of coolers. I think at some point, he\\u2019s going to come in and show me around the house. But I\\u2019m in the house alone and the house feels funny. It\\u2019s all white - white carpet and white walls - kind of like rentals. It looks like an 80\\u2019s house with glass window with super wide plastic blinds. The coolers are in this living room area. I have to step down two steps to get to this area because it\\u2019s one of those sunken living rooms. I go to the coolers. One of them is mine and I\\u2019m hungry, so I\\u2019m trying to dig through it. There are other coolers. One of the coolers belongs to my hula sister\\u2019s parents. The other cooler belongs to another person I know. I\\u2019m digging through trying to find food and also rearranging the coolers while I\\u2019m at it. Then this dude walks by. He\\u2019s been telling me about his wife the whole time, too. He says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you meet the lady of the house?\\u201d I still don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m in this house. It feels weird. When I look up at the doors I came through, they are these huge garage doors that lead to the garage where he parked the car. There\\u2019s the number 32 sticking out from the side and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s a very Harry Potter moment.\\u201d At some point, Dobby the elf from Harry Potter, shows up. It gets a bit weird. I don\\u2019t know what Dobby does, except he\\u2019s just there. I follow the dude into this kitchen and his kids are not home, but I\\u2019m wondering where they are. I\\u2019ve seen them with him at the grocery store, but they\\u2019re not here now. His wife is there. I walk into the kitchen because he\\u2019s going to introduce me to her. They\\u2019re in the middle of a conversation. His whole demeanor has changed and he\\u2019s very loving husband. He was not like that before. Before he was militant dad and when he was driving me around places and dancing, he was like weird controlling trying to seem like he knew what was going on and being sexy lover man and I was not having that. But now I\\u2019m watching him interact with his wife. He\\u2019s somewhat disrespectful. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re both using each other and they know it, or they both know they\\u2019re faking this husband and wife thing and living in a house with kids thing, and they know it and going with it anyway. He says, \\u201cOh my wife is so young.\\u201d Then I hear her say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m so young. People always want to know how I have a 25 year old child, but I\\u2019m 19.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! The math doesn\\u2019t work.\\u201d She turns around and she does not look young. She\\u2019s in her forties and her face is pockmarked and wrinkled. She has longer blonde hair to her midback. She\\u2019s thin. Her skin is tan. She\\u2019s going on and on about how young she is and trying to explain to me the math about how she has these older kids and how when her kids were babies, she was so young and she didn\\u2019t have anyone to raise her kids with and it was hard, but now she\\u2019s very wise because she had kids when she was so young. My brain is just not computing all of this. Throughout this entire dream, \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d is going through my head. We\\u2019re in their kitchen. The dude is sitting at an island/bar. She\\u2019s at the sink and she has turned around and is talking to me. She has poured herself a fat glass of wine - like half the bottle into a wine glass. I think she\\u2019s given him the other one. This is clearly their wind down ritual where they reconnect with each other. The whole thing is so bizarre. I wake up from the dream and am like, \\u201cEw, why did I dream that?!\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We\\u2019re outside and there\\u2019s a picnic table. I think there\\u2019s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We\\u2019re a part of that. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She\\u2019s hosting. I\\u2019m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They\\u2019re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it\\u2019s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There\\u2019s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I\\u2019m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I\\u2019m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they\\u2019re saying and learn from them. I think I\\u2019m really not welcome here. I don\\u2019t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I\\u2019m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It\\u2019s getting heated. They\\u2019re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I\\u2019m feeling all of these emotions. I\\u2019m pissed that that\\u2019s their reality and mine. I\\u2019m pissed that I feel like there\\u2019s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it\\u2019s more equal and fair for everyone. I\\u2019m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I\\u2019m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They\\u2019re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they\\u2019re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, \\u201cHey, I want you two to know that I\\u2019ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you\\u2019re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don\\u2019t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I\\u2019m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn\\u2019t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can\\u2019t tell if they appreciate what I\\u2019m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I\\u2019m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There\\u2019s a wooded forest behind me. There\\u2019s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I\\u2019m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they\\u2019re young. I\\u2019m a young adult in this place, or I\\u2019m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They\\u2019re playing and they\\u2019re hungry. They want something to eat. There\\u2019s a guy and in my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201coh my god, pedophile.\\u201d I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they\\u2019re playing. The kids say they\\u2019re really hungry and the guy is like, \\u201cWell, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019re all hungry. There\\u2019s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don\\u2019t even know where it\\u2019s plugged into. It\\u2019s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don\\u2019t want to take the meat from this guy because I don\\u2019t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He\\u2019s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he\\u2019s watching them play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t even watch them play.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it\\u2019s safer. I don\\u2019t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I\\u2019m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that\\u2019s right after me. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re talking about. We are in a different place. They\\u2019re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they\\u2019re in is devoid of trees. It\\u2019s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn\\u2019t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I\\u2019m talking to them and I\\u2019m checking in with them. But part of me doesn\\u2019t want to be talking about this with them because they\\u2019re not listening to me. They\\u2019re not hearing me. I\\u2019m not getting a say. I\\u2019m not getting to use my voice about this. They\\u2019re just telling me how things are. I\\u2019m annoyed because that\\u2019s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They\\u2019re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they\\u2019re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, \\u201cDo you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?\\u201d But they\\u2019re not listening and not open to it. I\\u2019m not saying anything. I\\u2019m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I\\u2019m working in the frozen and dairy section. I\\u2019ve just arrived and I\\u2019m talking to the manager and she is giving me the rundown of all the things that need to be done today. She says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s your coat.\\u201d There\\u2019s an extra coat for me to wear because it\\u2019s cold in the freezer and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cHere\\u2019s some music you can listen to.\\u201d That\\u2019s awesome. I get ready to get all my stuff and go. I\\u2019m not sure if we\\u2019re in the breakroom when she\\u2019s giving me all this stuff. I walk out of that place. All of a sudden I have to get to the cooler to grab all the stuff out of the cooler to stock it. I\\u2019m in this gigantic huge grand ballroom. It\\u2019s like a maze. There are areas I\\u2019m trying to get through. A gala is happening. There\\u2019s a huge party. I have to go get the frozen or dairy foods for the party. I have to pull it out, so now I\\u2019m catering. It\\u2019s being put on by my brothers or a family member, maybe my mom. My mom actually does put on events in real life. So I\\u2019m trying to make my way to the cooler. It\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s either so packed I can't move or I\\u2019m trying to obey the 6 feet distance rule and I\\u2019m having a hard time trying to get through the crowd and to the cooler. I have this cart - the carts we use in the back to load up our stuff. I\\u2019m trying to make my way, but then I hear the M.C. go: \\u201cAnd now, for our special guest, Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\u201d Sure enough, I look towards this doorway where people are coming in and out of. By the way, this is happening in a grand ballroom and there\\u2019s also a lawn and patio where this event is also happening. It\\u2019s a very big event. In the ballroom, the ceilings are so high I can\\u2019t even see the ceiling. The doorways are so tall, as you would see in a ballroom, that it takes a lot of effort just to open one door because the doors are so big and heavy. So these doors are open. The M.C. has announced Arnold Schwarzenegger and he walks through. What strikes me is the couple that walks before him, I think is my mom and dad, but it doesn\\u2019t look like them because these people are way tall and my parents aren\\u2019t particularly tall. Then, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his date or his wife walk through, also very tall. And then my brother and his fiancee walk through the door. My brother is just as tall as Arnold Schwarzenegger, so there are all these really tall people. I am sort of having this proud moment because I feel like this party or event is one my mom put on, but my brother is part of it and he made it happen. This was his vision and now here he is walking through the doors with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then the next thought that goes through my head is like, \\u201cWow, is Arnold Schwarzenegger such a B-List celebrity that he would agree to come to this gala event put on by my parents and brother?\\u201d Anyway, Arnold Schwarzenegger looks older, but not as old as he looks now. Then I am back to trying to get to the cooler so I can grab the stuff and bring it out for this party. The dream switches here. It goes from a beautiful gala party event with flower party arrangements and gold on the doors and on the walls, and the beautiful sconces and chandeliers, and just a very opulent setting to kind of dark, at least the lighting gets dark. I am watching these other people try to take over the ball. They have headsets on and they\\u2019re in a room where they\\u2019re watching everything on screens. They are trying to manage the ball from behind the scenes. They\\u2019re letting this centipede like creature with a round body- it\\u2019s like a toy from the 80s, that you could build bugs with, their bodies were really round and they have these yellow curly cue tongues and antennas and yellow peg legs you can put into the round bodies and make whatever size bug you wanted from these things. So, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m watching these people do - they are going to let this bug loose on the party. But it\\u2019s a super poisonous bug like a centipede with a ton of legs. I\\u2019m still trying to do my part. But now I realize I need to stop this bug because if they let this bug go and it stings everyone, it\\u2019s going to be chaos and it\\u2019s not good. In my mind I think this bug is going to kill people. So I actually pick it up behind it\\u2019s first bulbous round head thing. It\\u2019s trying to move through the party, going back through the doors the others came out of. It\\u2019s getting bigger and smaller, changing size. When it\\u2019s in its small phase, I pick it up and it leaves one of its segments behind. I\\u2019m just really horrified that this bug is being let loose and I\\u2019m trying to contain it. When I do pick it up, it shrinks down to its toy size, even though it leaves its segments behind. But it\\u2019s still really poisonous. I don\\u2019t want the front end of it to get anywhere near to me - kind of like when you grab a snake behind the head so it can\\u2019t bite you, I\\u2019m trying to keep it from biting me and everyone else. There\\u2019s a little bit of panic and suspicion now going through the party. It was very joyful and joyous with the clink of china and all that stuff happening to silence and panic and fear, definitely fear. And the lighting is now dark.\"],[\"Holy shit, this dream. And dreams within dreams. The deepest dream starts with me and all six of my high school classmates - two or three women and two or three men. They\\u2019re putting on a hula show for an audience. I don\\u2019t know who is in the audience. I haven\\u2019t learned it yet. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? How don\\u2019t I know this? Why didn\\u2019t you teach me? Out of all of us, I\\u2019m the actual hula dancer.\\u201d They are like, \\u201cWell, because you dance hula, you\\u2019ll be able to pick it up. But we\\u2019re going on stage now.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, right.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have the costume. Can you at least dance it for me at least once?\\u201d They find lei for me and costume for me. Interestingly enough, the costume is a bleached white pareo on the bottom. I don\\u2019t know what we have on top - I think nothing, just lei and lei on our head and kupe\\u2019e on our wrist and feet. I keep saying, \\u201cCan you show me the dance? Where in the lineup do I need to be for all of this?\\u201d We\\u2019re heading out onto the stage. The stage has maybe two inches of water on it and water all around it. The audience is on the other side of the water. We\\u2019re going to be dancing in the water. But I still don\\u2019t know the dance all the way, and none of my classmates are forthcoming. I get the sense that they\\u2019re bummed that I showed up and they were going to do the dance without me. They didn\\u2019t want me there. The reason they didn\\u2019t teach it to me is that they didn\\u2019t want me there upstaging them. This is such a strange thing in my mind. I don\\u2019t understand in my mind why as a class we\\u2019re presenting this hula to everyone and they\\u2019re trying to keep me out of it. Then the dream shifts to me being an observer. There is a dream oracle - he's like Edward - and a husband and wife. The wife looks like Julia Roberts. The man looks like a very stereotypical college professor type white man with the sweater and the khakis and loafers and glasses. This couple has come to see this dream oracle. They\\u2019re in a library - the dream oracle\\u2019s personal library with floor to ceiling books and lots of gold. It\\u2019s really ornate with all kinds of filigree style decorations of wall sconces and velvet chairs. It\\u2019s very opulent. The dream oracle is going to help them work through their dreams. The dream oracle explains to them how dreams work. You can see the man is very, very skeptical. But the wife is like, \\u201cOf course, it totally makes sense that dreams work this way - that they are hidden messages with multiple layers and that they come from other realms.\\u201d The husband is like, \\u201cWhatever, this is a bunch of bullshit.\\u201d This is where there is a dream within a dream. I watch them go into a dreamstate. In the dreamstate, the husband and wife are very lovely dovey. They\\u2019re in an open field with clouds. The husband just goes psycho. There\\u2019s another man there. I\\u2019m not sure who or what he is. The husband turns into a psycho as his wife watches. His true nature comes out in this dreamstate. He\\u2019s not just an animal, he\\u2019s cruel. This other man that shows up in the dream, he cuts his head off. The blood sprays all over the wife. The wife starts to freak out. This is where they\\u2019re in the dream together. So even though she\\u2019s freaking out, I can hear her say, \\u201cThis is just a dream, it\\u2019s not real.\\u201d The husband is trying to kiss her, but he\\u2019s very violent about it. He\\u2019s grabbed her hair. He\\u2019s covered in blood and he has a knife in his hand from when he cut the head off the other person in this dream. They come out of the dream together. They\\u2019re back in the dream oracle\\u2019s study. She\\u2019s horrified. I'm horrified. I\\u2019m looking at the husband and can tell that the dream completely revealed who he actually was. Maybe it was just a dream, but maybe it was the realest thing because now they can see who the husband is. He\\u2019s this violent guy, not the stereotypical well-spoken professor that he showed up as. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m no longer an observer. I\\u2019m back in my body. There\\u2019s a woman. She\\u2019s older than me. In this part of the dream, I\\u2019m younger, maybe 12 or 13 at least. She has a ton of books. She\\u2019s selling books. I\\u2019m outside with her. The books are on this round wooden table with a single leg in the middle. She goes door to door selling books and she\\u2019s showing me how to sell books to make money. She has dark hair that touches her shoulders. Her face is friendly. I get the sense she is not of this world. I\\u2019m trying to take in everything she says about selling the books, but I have this weird sense that things are not as they seem. I have my bicycle and there\\u2019s a little basket on the front. It doesn\\u2019t have any gears - it\\u2019s an old-fashioned bike with a banana seat. I\\u2019m putting some of the books in the front so we can go door to door and sell these books. I don\\u2019t know exactly what\\u2019s in them. She\\u2019s trying to tell me what\\u2019s in them, but I\\u2019m not remembering. So I\\u2019m younger in this part of the dream, but then the dream goes forward and now I\\u2019m probably 18-12. I\\u2019m college-aged. Now I\\u2019m with Josh, current lover in waking life, and his girlfriend. We\\u2019re all going to college together. He\\u2019s registering for courses. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m here because I\\u2019ve already been to college and don\\u2019t like college. I already have two degrees and don\\u2019t want to be here. What\\u2019s heartbreaking for me is that he\\u2019s with his girlfriend and they\\u2019re registering for classes together and I hear him say, \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s so many people here to meet and sleep with!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, I\\u2019m going to register for all my classes.\\u201d The thought crosses my mind, \\u201cWhy are you even here with him registering for classes? You\\u2019ve already got your degrees? And why are you registering for all of these undergrad courses. If you\\u2019re going to go back to school, get your PhD.\\u201d My response to that is like, I don\\u2019t want to do that. I don\\u2019t need a PhD. I don\\u2019t need to go to classes to get a PhD. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m here. I\\u2019m only here because I followed this guy here. And now he\\u2019s off and encouraging me to go meet a bunch of people. But I\\u2019m like, I don\\u2019t need you to tell me that. I don\\u2019t need your permission. I\\u2019m questioning why we\\u2019re even here together. I decide to write the whole thing off and try to make it my own. The dream shifts one more time. College is still part of it. Now my mom is here. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey honey, I got you some shoes. They were giving shoes away to low income people.\\u201d I guess I qualify as a low income person. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know if I need any shoes.\\u201d But I look. They\\u2019re these oxfords with the heel and front toe a dark maroon and the rest of the shoe is light pink. The colors go well together and the shoes are cute for low income. But I\\u2019m not expecting any shoes. I don\\u2019t need any shoes. I don\\u2019t feel like a low income person and don\\u2019t know why I need these shoes. They\\u2019re cute but I don\\u2019t actually want them. I wake up thinking that I don\\u2019t want any of this. I feel like I\\u2019m not following my path. I recall how the woman selling the books was telling me I need to do my own thing. I had this sense of frustration and my jaw was tight and tired as if I was grinding my teeth in the dream because I was playing catch up or doing something I didn\\u2019t want to do or I\\u2019m doing something that is not at my level. I get the sense that I\\u2019ve learned all this stuff and am repeating all of these patterns, but it\\u2019s time to move on and stop taking what\\u2019s offered to me as if there aren\\u2019t other things being offered to me or other things I could be taken advantage of. The feeling of being irritated stays with me.\"],[\"This is the deeper part of the dream that I\\u2019m only remembering flashes of. I\\u2019m with my high school classmates, three girls, Janet, Shawna and Julie. There are other classmates with me, but I\\u2019m not sure which ones. They\\u2019re all getting ready for a party and I\\u2019m trying to get ready with them. The house we\\u2019re in is dark. There was a felt sense of unease. My brother shows up, too. We are fighting and arguing. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re fighting about, but there\\u2019s definitely discord. All I can remember of this part of the dream is that I\\u2019m trying to get ready. They\\u2019re all ready to go and are leaving. I\\u2019m trying to find shoes to put on. I\\u2019m trying to find an entire outfit - I don\\u2019t know what to wear and don\\u2019t have anything that feels good. Part of it is my resistance to going to this party. It\\u2019s making it hard for me to decide on an outfit and shoes. A coworker of mine is here, too - he\\u2019s my date to this party. Of all the other characters, he\\u2019s the only one I feel comfortable with. He\\u2019s encouraging me in a sweet way to get dressed and get in the car with him. I do. There\\u2019s a party of the dream where I\\u2019m in the car with him and we are going somewhere. That feels nice and my body feels calm in that place. But there\\u2019s so much agitation beforehand when I\\u2019m trying to get dressed, and there is bickering between me and my friends and me and my brother. My coworker is trying to smooth everything out, help me get ready and take me to the party. I go from being in the house in the living room area with friends to being in his Jeep or truck. I have feelings of gratitude and safety while I'm in the car with him. Then the scene changes. I am outdoors near the ocean. There\\u2019s a covered pavilion area and a bunch of people dancing hula. It\\u2019s so lovely to watch them dancing. It\\u2019s a bunch of different haul halaus dancing, so they each have their own style and their own songs. It\\u2019s not super formal because there isn\\u2019t a stage. I\\u2019m standing watching them to my right and behind me. They have their leis and everything. The musicians are somewhere and I can hear them playing the music, but I can\\u2019t see them. Then my hula sister Deborah shows up with her dad and her mom and my hula brother, Uncle Kam who is also my alaka\\u2019i (leader) in the hula halau. We all look at each other and wonder why we aren\\u2019t dancing because we know how to dance and we have dances to share. So, we try to put on our music. Deborah\\u2019s dad starts to play - he\\u2019s our musician - but it\\u2019s so quiet that it\\u2019s hard to hear him over the crowd noise of all the other dancers. There\\u2019s this feeling of being misfits and not allowed or accepted. We are all trying to dance, but since we can\\u2019t hear the music, our movements are all a little bit off. The other dancers are looking at us like, \\u201cWhat are you guys doing? You\\u2019re not good.\\u201d But we are just unable to hear the music fully. That part of the dream fades away. The last thing I remember before waking is a voice saying it\\u2019s time for me to be soft and release all the tension in my body. Let go of the way things were and the way you knew how to do them. Be soft.\"],[\"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people, but don\\u2019t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We\\u2019re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re heading, except that we\\u2019re trying to get out of where we are. It\\u2019s dark. If there is any lightning, it\\u2019s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we\\u2019re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don\\u2019t even know what they all do. We\\u2019re on the move. We\\u2019re all kind of dirty and grungy. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There\\u2019s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I\\u2019ve been practicing pole moves that she\\u2019s given me at home, but something happens and I\\u2019m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I\\u2019m watching. She\\u2019s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can\\u2019t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you\\u2019re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I\\u2019m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They\\u2019re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven\\u2019t touched a pole in weeks and don\\u2019t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it\\u2019s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It\\u2019s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I\\u2019m holding onto the handle to push out. I\\u2019m super disappointed because it\\u2019s so hard for me to do these moves because I\\u2019ve taken so much time off. I don\\u2019t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven\\u2019t been able to do what I\\u2019d like to do. I keep thinking I\\u2019m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I\\u2019ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back. That always bugs me.\"],[\"The first part of this dream is definitely collective-related. I\\u2019m in a car. There\\u2019s a car in front of me that I can see, it\\u2019s a Subaru. We are driving through snow. The snow is as tall as the car. I can see the car in front of us is having to make its own path through the snow. It\\u2019s interesting it\\u2019s making it because the snow is literally up to the top of the car. We are on our way to a shelter. We\\u2019re on an adventure. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who I\\u2019m with. We\\u2019re heading towards a hotel - it reminds me of an ice hotel in northern Europe. We make it there. There are multiple rooms, but it doesn\\u2019t actually look like a hotel. It looks like a huge cave and within the cave are rooms you can claim as yours. There were at least two people in the car in front of me and there are people in the car with me - I don\\u2019t know who or how many. We head into the hotel and get our rooms. The rooms are packed snow - the bed is snow shaped into a bed as you would shape a snowman. When you go out of the room and down the hall, there\\u2019s a huge crack in the ceiling where you can see blue sky. But when you look up, you can also see a cliff face that looks like the side of a mountain. The back part of the hotel is this huge cliff face. Something happens and I don\\u2019t know if somebody yells or a gunshot goes off or what, but there\\u2019s a moment with a really loud noise. As soon as that happens, I say, \\u201cOh fuck!\\u201d I know that whatever that was, it\\u2019s a moment in a time when something acts as a catalyst and as soon as it happens, I can see an avalanche at the top of the cliff. The snow just starts coming down. There\\u2019s no fucking way any of us are getting out of the path. This hotel is full of people, including kids. I just know that we are all going to be buried by this avalanche. I had this hope in my heart that it stops or goes around us or somehow we get out in time. Now I\\u2019m booking it out the other way as fast as I can to get away from this avalanche. If I can just get in the car and get out and drive away as fast as I can get out. Then the dream shifts from this place to a gym facility with multiple rooms for exercise, but also big pools. I\\u2019m with my daughter and she\\u2019s little, maybe 4, 5 or 6. There are also a lot of other young girls, teenagers. They\\u2019re on a team of some sort visiting the pool together. My daughter and I are in the locker room. We head out to the pool area. I have my wallet and phone on me. My wallet is one I had when I was a teenager - a black leather Volcrum brand. It was a men\\u2019s wallet, but I liked it because it fit into the grunge aesthetic. I put the wallet down with the phone on top, and my keys, too. It\\u2019s just this random bench on the side of the pool. There\\u2019s a huge slide, at least 10 or 12 stories high and you have to climb up stairs to get there. My daughter is running ahead of me and I\\u2019m chasing her. I don\\u2019t want her to go down this slide - it\\u2019s too tall and too dangerous. But as I am going up these steps, I can feel my heart is fucking racing. I\\u2019m looking down and I can see the surrounding city. There\\u2019s smog and the buildings are tiny. We\\u2019re up so high. I\\u2019m starting to panic. We never get to the top of the slide because all of a sudden, the stairs start to go down. My daughter is going down and I\\u2019m feeling relieved that she\\u2019s going down the stairs. I\\u2019m coming down the stairs and am like, \\u201cOh sweet baby Jesus, thank you!\\u201d I do not like heights. There are all these landings, at about every ten stairs. My mom is at one of the landings and she has a bowl of rice and poke. I\\u2019m starving and freaked out from being so high. I\\u2019ve also been worried about my daughter, who I can see has now made it all the way back down the stairs and is running around at the edge of the pool below me. I\\u2019m thinking that she\\u2019s safer down there and it\\u2019s okay. I can still see my wallet, keys and phone. I don\\u2019t know why anyone isn\\u2019t stealing them because they\\u2019re just sitting by themselves on this bench. And my daughter is also down there and she\\u2019s okay. There are some other people on this landing with me and my mom. It\\u2019s like my mom has come to me and the other people are my people - they are strangers, but I don\\u2019t feel threatened by them. But with my mom, I\\u2019m feeling a bit edgy. So she has this bowl of rice and poke and she sets it down. It\\u2019s the most perfectly made. There\\u2019s also seared ahi and just barely seared steak in this bowl, too. She sets it down between us and I go to eat some of it, but I knock it over. A bunch of it falls onto the stairs. These stairs are metal. I just pick it up and put it back in the bowl because I\\u2019m not going to waste it. I know there have been tons of people with their bare feet and chlorine and pool water coming up these stairs, but i just put it all back in the bowl because I\\u2019m going to eat it anyway. It\\u2019s like an offering she\\u2019s made towards me and I\\u2019m hungry enough I\\u2019m going to eat and I\\u2019m freaked out enough that I need something to really ground me and bring me back into my body and shift out of this panic state. This panic state went through both of these dreams. The dream shifts. Now I\\u2019m watching a tictoc video of a young local Hawaiian woman. She has her hair in a bun. She\\u2019s hanging out with her friends. She does a forward roll and the bun comes undone, so as it loosens the bun gets bigger. As her bun comes undone, her friends are teasing her saying, \\u201cOh it looks so funny!\\u201d She\\u2019s like \\u201cOh no!\\u201d and tightens the bun back up on her head. There was almost a bit of shame with her hair coming undone because her hair needing to stay up. They were poking fun at her but it wasn\\u2019t shaming and humiliating fun. But she was concerned about her hair coming out of this bun. This was a video that I was watching.\"],[\"I am in a house. I don\\u2019t recognize the house. My mother is there. She\\u2019s kind, which is strange because she\\u2019s not usually. We are washing dishes together at the sink. The sink has a bunch of windows that we\\u2019re looking out of and there are a bunch of indoor plants hanging. The plants are beautiful. One of them is totally cool and looks like green pearls that hang down. There are other leafy ones. That setting is quite beautiful. The energy and vibration coming from the plants is amazing and healing. But I don\\u2019t feel very comfortable talking to my mom - I feel like she wants something from me and I\\u2019m not wanting to give it to her. She wants kindness from me, I think. I do not want to give her any compassion and kindness. I\\u2019m faking it though and going through the motions. There\\u2019s another piece of the dream where I am holding my son as a toddler, he\\u2019s maybe 2 or 3. I\\u2019m just loving on him and he seems pretty content. I put him down to play. We\\u2019re hanging out next to each other and both of us are doing the parallel play that toddlers do. Then all of a sudden, in my mind, I go, \\u201cOh my god, I\\u2019m an adult and yes, he\\u2019s content and happy where he is right there, but actually we need human connection.\\u201d I pick him up and his demeanor changes from very content and quiet toddler play to this absolute snuggly. His little body clings to me and he\\u2019s so much happier when I pick him up, love on him and include him instead of putting him down so he does his thing and I do my thing. It just dawns on me that I need to be holding him and carrying him. The connection between the two of us enlivens and blossoms and blooms. It\\u2019s so much better and deeper the second I pick him up and look at him in his face and eyes and he looks back at me. We\\u2019re connected and touching and present, really present with each other.\"],[\"I am with my lover - it\\u2019s not anyone I recognize from real life. He has tan skin and these piercing blue eyes. He\\u2019s not 100% white, he\\u2019s definitely a person of color. I\\u2019m in his bedroom. I\\u2019m naked. He\\u2019s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I\\u2019m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s mine, but I\\u2019m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It\\u2019s weird and doesn\\u2019t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It\\u2019s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It\\u2019s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I\\u2019m on my back. I can see my lover and he\\u2019s over me. He has a fork. He\\u2019s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?\\u201d This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s what I want, let\\u2019s go for that.\\u201d Then I do this weird thing while I\\u2019m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they\\u2019re scratching my skin with the fork. It\\u2019s like some very strange BDSM play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, this is what I want. Go for it. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But the lucid part of me is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?\\u201d I\\u2019m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I\\u2019m not enjoying at all. I\\u2019m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, \\u201cHere let me show you how to use your power now.\\u201d It\\u2019s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn\\u2019t. They say, \\u201cYeah okay, show us how.\\u201d They are truly wanting to learn. Somehow I have this queen-like presence, even though part of me sees this is not it. Then they are paid and they leave. Other people are showing up at the house, like we\\u2019re having a party. There are younger women - girls, maybe early 20s - who have shown up. I\\u2019m out on the back deck adjacent to the bedroom I was just in. The bedroom was huge with white gauzy curtains and the fancy netting over the bed. All the sheets and linens and carpet were white - everything was white in this room. I go out to the deck and some of these girls from the party show up. I\\u2019m switching out the rugs that were on the deck and right at the door to wipe your feet on. I\\u2019m showing these women how to pick the correct one that goes with the decor for this party.\"],[\"A lot of different parts to this dream. I\\u2019m with a friend, Vanessa, she was another white girl who would hang out with my hula halau. She wouldn't actually dance, but she lived across the street from my kumu\\u2019s house and she would watch the kids. She was a super humble woman and also a lesbian. She\\u2019s making dinner for us - she was very much a caretaker. She\\u2019s making a meal. I\\u2019m excited for it. But I taste it and it doesn\\u2019t taste good - something feels a little bit off about it. Somehow my friends from where I live now, Austin and Aila - they own a cattle ranch - are in the dream, too. There is food that Austin is contributing because they raise cattle for eating. There\\u2019s a table where Vanessa is making the food and white walls everywhere else. When Aila and Austin show up, we are in her house, which is gorgeous. It\\u2019s a two-story house with windows that go from the floor to the second story on one side. Her kitchen is big and beautiful. She\\u2019s upset about something. She leaves. Austin starts to tell us that she\\u2019s trying to kill herself - she\\u2019s been eating poison. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on. Why is she doing that? I keep asking him if I can go see her or find her. He says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t even find her.\\u201d He also says, \\u201cNo, leave her be. She wants to be alone.\\u201d I\\u2019m really worried about this. He says, \\u201cCome with me.\\u201d I go with him. Now there are other people around and I\\u2019m not quite sure who they are - it might be my siblings or other people we both know. He says, \\u201cWe have a job to do, so let\\u2019s give Aila her space. Let\\u2019s go do our job.\\u201d We go to a Home Depot or Lowe\\u2019s type of place with hardware and all the stuff you\\u2019d find at those kinds of places, as well as their garden center. He says, \\u201cEverybody grab a plant.\\u201d We all have to bring a plant with us. I have a plant in my hand and am feeling good about having this plant - a green lush hanging plant. Whoever else I\\u2019m with is young because it feels like Austin is directing us all. He\\u2019s in charge of directing us and giving us a task. So now all of us have plants. We\\u2019re filing through the checkout line with our plants. Then, Austin and the others start to recede. Even the hardware store starts to recede. What comes forward is what seems to be Lahaina in Maui. But it does not actually look like Lahaina, at least not the Lahaina I remember. I\\u2019m there and I\\u2019m on the street. My plant is gone now. I think I\\u2019m with one of my brothers. We are walking through the streets. I have this feeling of homesickness and longing. Even though the streets don\\u2019t look like Lahaina, the palm trees are there, the tall papaya trees the banyan, and the monkeypod trees are there. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood and walking down these streets with houses on them. At one point, there\\u2019s a really big hill that I need to walk up. Through all of this, my brother is with me. Then he disappears. I\\u2019m now wandering through a part of Lahaina that feels barren or industrial - it doesn\\u2019t feel beautiful like Hawaii is. My mom and dad show up and say, \\u201cHere, come with us. We\\u2019re going this direction.\\u201d They\\u2019re young - they don\\u2019t look like who I grew up with, but like who they looked like before kids. So I follow them to the end of the road. They get in this line. There\\u2019s a crowd of people and a house. The house is freaking beautiful. Suddenly, the Ko\\u2019olaus are there. At the end of this road, we\\u2019ve passed through this weird area that doesn\\u2019t look like Hawaii and now we\\u2019re at this house that does look like Hawaii. There\\u2019s an avocado tree growing in the yard. The backdrop is all these green luscious Ko\\u2019olau mountains. There\\u2019s a crowd of people all there to see the wizard that lives at this house at the end of the road where everything is lush and green. He has some answers for everybody. My parents say, \\u201cYou have to be very respectful. You may not be invited in. He may not talk with you.\\u201d Then I see the wizard come out of his house. He wanders up the side of his lawn. There is a thick grey wall between the neighborhoods and the magical place of green and avocado trees and lusciousness. I\\u2019m on the side of the wall that is the neighborhood side. The wizard invites two people in at a time to talk with him. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to go into my house this time. You can ask me questions out here in my yard.\\u201d His yard is the base of the Ko\\u2019olaus so it goes up really steeply. I\\u2019m watching from the side of the wall as all these people go and ask their questions of him. My parents turn. I have an old point and shoot camera, and this other woman grabs the camera out of my hand. I\\u2019m trying to take pictures of the green mountains - not of the wizard and my parents. The beauty is so breathtaking that I want to take a picture of it. But this woman comes up. She is a tourist with an accent, not from the US. She grabs my little grey camera and she goes to advance the film - the way you do by pulling back on the lever. But instead of doing that, she starts winding the film up, the way you do when you finish a roll. I can hear her breaking the camera as she does that. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not how you do it. You\\u2019re not actually being helpful.\\u201d But she thinks she\\u2019s being so helpful. I\\u2019m looking at the camera and thinking if I try to advance it just once it will be okay. I try and it doesn\\u2019t work. I can see where it is and open it up, but I know if I do, I will ruin the film. I do open it up and see that sure enough the film on the inside is broken. So there\\u2019s no camera, no pictures. This woman was in line behind my parents who had been talking with the wizard this whole time. I go around the wall and sneak up and sit down to hear what he has to say. There is a sense that he will teach me and share with me what he knows. My parents didn\\u2019t think it was time for me to learn from him because I\\u2019m a kid to them, but I know I\\u2019m me and I can definitely learn all the things that need to be learned about magic from a wizard. He agrees to start teaching me. I sit down with him in his yard at the base of these mountains. There\\u2019s one other piece of the dream where I\\u2019m the observer. It\\u2019s a young couple - teenage kids. They\\u2019ve run off together. They\\u2019ve run away from their families so they can be together even if it\\u2019s just at the beach, which is where I\\u2019m seeing them. She\\u2019s definitely the one who is more riled up and instigating and pushing it. He has fear of his parents and retaliation, but he really loves her and wants to be with her. So the two of them are just hanging out for now. I see him sitting at a dock and she says, \\u201cHey, we\\u2019ve gotta go do these things. We have to get away from our family, society and culture that say we can't be together.\\u201d The boy is a Latino boy. The girl is white. At one point she drops herself into the ocean off the edge of this dock. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh gross, the water is not clean. There is too much pollution. This sandy beach you were sitting on is covered in micro-litter. It\\u2019s just not clean.\\u201d The boy is saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not clean. Don\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we only live once. We have to do these things. Come into the water. Play with me.\\u201d\"],[\"There\\u2019s a talk show happening. I\\u2019m watching it but also engaging in it and participating. I\\u2019m on the set. I\\u2019m there in real time. It\\u2019s a bunch of young teenage girls. They\\u2019re all wearing some version of a blue knit sweater. They are all from the same school so this is a uniform but they\\u2019ve each made it their own. They\\u2019re European or Swedish by nationality, but ethnicity ranges with Asian girls and black girls. They\\u2019re all female-bodied and from this one school. They\\u2019re sitting in rows in desks and I\\u2019m facing them, looking at them. There\\u2019s a big green screen behind them. To their right is a male teacher/interviewer. He is asking them these trivia quotations and they\\u2019re answering. But he\\u2019s a little bit off. Every once in a while he says something that\\u2019s super off-color or super sexist or just super objectifying. At one point I hear him saying, \\u201cAnd don\\u2019t they all have glorious tits?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck did he just say?\\u201d He says that kind of stuff, but the girls, instead of taking offence, they just own it and make it their own - not in the giggling way and giving away of power, but in a \\u201coh so you noticed, idiot, good.\\u201d It\\u2019s a very interesting dynamic. But they\\u2019re still young. I can feel they\\u2019re young and they don\\u2019t know everything because they haven\\u2019t experienced everything. It\\u2019s just so strange. This is all being televised and people are watching. At some point, my focus shifts from these young ladies to the show host. He kind of beckons me over. He wants me to look at the green screen. So I get close to him and say, \\u201cOkay, what do you want?\\u201d He says, \\u201cLook really carefully at this screen.\\u201d On the green screen is a map of the world. He says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re only showing you part of it.\\u201d As he says that, suddenly all these spots on the green screen that are showing the globe burst into flames - not physical flames, but a simulation of flames that are all over the world. He says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re not showing you everything. The world is on fire in so many more ways and places than you think.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god!\\u201d kind of like conspiracy theory style, but also not - just the plain facts that there is so much more burning than we think. In part of the show he was asking these young ladies, \\u201cWhat do you think of environmentalism? What do you think about racism?\\u201d As in what are your solutions? What can we do about it? It\\u2019s been a very interesting dynamic where with his questions he is teasing out their knowledge and their wisdom, but also saying really fucked up things and showing how this world is on fire in ways that we don\\u2019t know and places that we don\\u2019t know. Be aware that there\\u2019s so much more going on. Then the dream shifts to the shores of a beach - it\\u2019s super rugged and rocky, but not too windy. The sun is out. There\\u2019s a breeze. My son is with me. We\\u2019re going to a picnic or barbecue with people. There are all kinds of people. My son is at my shoulder and his presence stays with me, but he wanders off to go play and have fun. I\\u2019m watching these men. Some are black and some I don\\u2019t know their color. They\\u2019re tossing a football and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI want to play.\\u201d They throw me the football and I\\u2019m throwing it with a really good spiral. The thought crosses my mind: \\u201cWow, there\\u2019s a lot of sun. I\\u2019m glad I have sunscreen on my face and my hair.\\u201d But then I look down and I\\u2019m wearing one of these tops from when I was a kid. It\\u2019s an 80\\u2019s crop top with elastic on the bottom and top and you can pull it down off the shoulders and there\\u2019s a ruffle, so the ruffle is on the top and you pull it down over your shoulders. It\\u2019s a gross, not attractive cream color. It has way too much yellow in it. It\\u2019s not a good color on me. I look down and all of that skin that is exposed - over the shoulders and top of the chest - is burnt.The rest of me had sunscreen on, but that is burnt. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god!\\u201d and realize that I need to get into the shade. It\\u2019s interesting, this scene begins with a rugged beach and coastline, but there\\u2019s grass where I\\u2019m throwing the football, and past that are trees - a forest of oak trees, really gentle. I give up playing football because I realize how burnt I am. I\\u2019m walking toward the trees because I want to get into the shade. I pass two black women sitting on the grassy part. They are having their lunch and talking. I notice how they have their eyes on me as I\\u2019m walking past. They were relaxed and laughing and enjoying each other, but as soon as I get close, their entire demeanor and bodies change to this wariness like, \\u201cOh god, what is this white girl going to say? What is she going to do?\\u201d It breaks my heart because I see them disappear and I see them tracking me to make sure I\\u2019m not going to do anything. I try to make a joke how I managed to burn the fuck out of my skin. They do the polite laugh, but there\\u2019s not real connection. It\\u2019s fucking heartbreaking because I want that real connection. So I continue on to get out of their space and head to the trees, so I can take care of my burn. Then I get into the trees and the scene changes again. Now I see a walkin to a freezer and a supply closet where there are tasks to do. There\\u2019s a crew of us. We\\u2019re in some sort of building - maybe a grocery store. There\\u2019s a really low ceiling and I\\u2019m feeling quite claustrophobic. There is a manager and I don\\u2019t know them in real life. The manager is handing out tasks for everyone to do. A lot of the people have been given tasks where they have to leave this small space then come back. But I am not. The task they give me makes me stay in this small space where I feel so claustrophobic and cold. I\\u2019m going in and out of this walkin freezer and this space that feels like a supply closet. It\\u2019s so crowded and there\\u2019s not a lot of room. I\\u2019m looking at the manager like, \\u201cCan I get a different job? This is so tedious and so claustrophobic.\\u201d The manager is like, \\u201cNope, this is the one you have.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, but I could do a job where I can be outside and move my body. I\\u2019m just stuck in this spot doing this very tedious, repetitive task.\\u201d I think the task is cleaning the shelves or something. I am like, \\u201cThis is not going to last long.\\u201d No, just no. I\\u2019m feeling boxed in and just doing something that does not use my skills to the best of my ability, but the manager is stubborn about me doing it. It\\u2019s frustrating.\"],[\"This dream starts with Dana and I. We\\u2019re together and learning about anti-racism. We\\u2019re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We\\u2019re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He\\u2019s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we\\u2019re all watching. I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I\\u2019m feeling unsure and I don't know what we\\u2019re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don\\u2019t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I\\u2019m white. So I\\u2019m nervous. We\\u2019re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, \\u201cWhat do I do with Majesty?! I\\u2019m not nursing and I can\\u2019t feed him!\\u201d I have this feeling that I can\\u2019t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I\\u2019m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We\\u2019re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, you just dropped the baby!\\u201d I go to pick up the baby and Majesty\\u2019s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no!\\u201d I\\u2019m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?\\u201d Then I realize Majesty\\u2019s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he\\u2019s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he\\u2019s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphitheatre. I\\u2019m going to watch a performance. Everybody in the crowd is dressed to the nines like they\\u2019re going to see an opera. In the front row I see Nani, Janet and Shawna who are my three friends from high school that I used to hang out with. I see them and am pretending not to see them because I don't want to talk to them. But they see me and I see them track me. I walk past them and sit. I watch the performance (I don\\u2019t remember what it was). The performance ends and I walk out of the theatre. I\\u2019m in the lobby now and the lobby looks an awful lot like the lobby of the theatre at the high school I went to. It was called Gates Theatre because that was the last name of the people who donated enough money to build it. The three of them call my name and are like, \\u201cRose! Hi! We see you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, hi!\\u201d But I don\\u2019t want to talk. In Junior year of high school, Nani and Janet dropped me from the friend group and Shawna went with another friend group so I was left with no friends in my junior year. In my senior year, Nani moved away, but she sent me a letter apologizing for ostracizing me and leaving me out. I realize this is my hesitation. They always show up in my dreams and I'm like, Eh. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou know what, I\\u2019m great, I\\u2019m fine.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do small talk. But Nani wants a hug, so I guess I\\u2019ll hug her. Then I get away as quickly as I can. I go sit on a barstool at a tall table. My classmate Ikaika who I've known since second grade cruises by. He does this double take because I don\\u2019t look how I used to look and it\\u2019s not just age - I\\u2019ve had a nose job since my brother broke my nose and I just look different than I did in high school. He\\u2019s trying to figure out who it is. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey Ikaika, it\\u2019s Rose.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d He\\u2019s doing the double take thing and side eye thing that men do when they see an attractive woman. He's like, \\u201cYou are so beautiful. You are gorgeous.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup!\\u201d I hug him hello and we do some small talk and then he goes on his way. Then the dream comes back around to King Noire and anti-racism and sex work. Now I\\u2019m in a car with King. It\\u2019s a Cadillac and the top is down. We\\u2019re driving through a city and through some shady neighborhoods. I\\u2019m taking everything in. My jaw is dropped. He\\u2019s talking to me about sex, anti-racism and social justice. I can\\u2019t recall his exact words. He\\u2019s teaching and I\\u2019m listening. We end up near a river. There\\u2019s a shell floaty - like Aphrodite. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, now here\\u2019s the part of your education aroudn sex.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d Oh, I\\u2019ve been eating blueberries and they\\u2019re so sweet - they\\u2019re the most magical delicious blueberries that have ever existed. I climb on the shell and I have the blueberries. I\\u2019m wearing a skirt. King offers me the rest of the blueberries: \\u201cTake as many as you want because these are the last of them. So I put the blueberries in my lap right over my pussy. I\\u2019m eating them and am reclined back in this shell that is now floating down the river. King is like, \\u201cNow it\\u2019s time for your sex education.\\u201d There are so many feelings and thoughts and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what to do!\\u201d He leans over me and starts to eat the blueberries out of my lap where I have them nestled in my skirt. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh hell yes!\\u201d When I look up, I realize he\\u2019s completely naked and he\\u2019s leaning over me from the top. So it\\u2019s like yes, his penis is right in my face. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! I know what to do with this!\\u201d From that point forward, all of my \\u201coh my god I don't know what\\u2019s happening\\u201d thoughts change to \\u201coh I don\\u2019t need to be an expert, I know what to do with what's in front of me.\\u201d There\\u2019s this beautiful dick hanging in front of my mouth and I am definitely going to suck on that. It\\u2019s a knowing. This part ends with us 69\\u2019ing in a shell floating down a river in a city by some shady neighborhoods. It\\u2019s not a problem! I realize I was just getting in my own way of things I was trying to learn. The whole time King was being very stern and very king-like. There\\u2019s a recognition of King and his wife - they are so centered, they know who they are, they know what they\\u2019re doing here, they know their worth, they don't fucking question it, they just are king and queen. The whole time I didn\\u2019t know if I was worthy. But by the end of the dream, I knew what to do and realized this is very human. What else would you do if I had a lapful of blueberries?!\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to see my lover. He\\u2019s working out in the forest. There\\u2019s a complex of a bunch of buildings where he\\u2019s working with a bunch of his buddies. One building is a dorm. There\\u2019s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I\\u2019m out there and thinking I\\u2019ll do this work with him. He\\u2019s really not happy to see me. He\\u2019s really pissed off that I\\u2019m in his space. I\\u2019m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there\\u2019s a whole sheet of them, so there\\u2019s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I\\u2019ve collected it and I\\u2019m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There\\u2019s a presence of my son, but he\\u2019s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don\\u2019t come out here.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019m actually here to do work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t lie to me. I know you\\u2019re here to see me.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling hurt and confused. I\\u2019m not really sure why I\\u2019m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he\\u2019s not happy about it. I\\u2019m not happy about it now either, because he\\u2019s being a bit of a dick. He\\u2019s asking me all kinds of questions like, \\u201cWhat are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?\\u201d He\\u2019s asking all these questions that I don\\u2019t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn\\u2019t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can\\u2019t remember. In the last scene, I\\u2019m with a client of mine who is getting married. It\\u2019s the day of the wedding and I\\u2019m there as an officiant. I\\u2019m also there to set up the wedding. It\\u2019s the second time she\\u2019s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting read are not there. I\\u2019m trying to make these burlap pumpkins as part of the decor. I\\u2019m just making do with what I\\u2019ve got because I can\\u2019t find some of the supplies I used last time when I was getting everything ready for the wedding, but it didn\\u2019t happen. This time I\\u2019m trying to do my best with what I\\u2019ve got. My client is really excited. She\\u2019s trying on her wedding dress. She\\u2019s showing it to me. We\\u2019re in this room that\\u2019s part of a bigger hall where she\\u2019s getting married. Her bridesmaids are there and there are other people. It\\u2019s going to work even though it got canceled once and we don\\u2019t have all the supplies we had last night. We\\u2019re still making the wedding work and she still looks beautiful. There\\u2019s joy in this part of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve come in off the streets - it\\u2019s a neighborhood, city-like feel with lots of people. It\\u2019s dark, not quite night. I go into a shop where I work. We sell lights - beautifully made unique chandeliers and light fixtures. There is also art on the wall. I work for an older woman in her fifties or early sixties. One of my duties is to clean up. The shop looks kind of dusty and the lights haven\\u2019t been cleaned in a while. There\\u2019s a lot of clutter everywhere on the counters and whatnot. Some of the clutter is mine that I\\u2019ve just left around. There\\u2019s a pair of jeans and a wet towel on the countertop. It\\u2019s just really messy. The relationship I have with this lady is familiar but not healthy. This asian man walks in and wants to buy a chandelier. He picks out one that has panes of green glass - the glass is cut into rectangles and squares. The woman is selling it specifically to him - it\\u2019s not like he has just wandered in. He has to decorate his elderly parents\\u2019 flat. He needs lights no matter what and is very consciously picking out the lights with the green tones. He thinks that his parents will like it. To him, it also has significance around healing and keeping them healthy. The owner of the shop is wrapping it up for him. I was in the back cleaning up the towel and that weird pair of jeans. There\\u2019s another chandelier that I was looking at earlier and showing the shop owner. It\\u2019s a longer chandelier - maybe five feet long - with thick brass or gold round tubes that hang down from the top where the light is. It also has a cascade of glass panels like the other one, but the panels are not blue and green, they are the colors of a pastel rainbow. I say something like, \\u201cThis is our unicorn chandelier.\\u201d I put it down while I was cleaning. It needed to be cleaned and it was definitely one of our more expensive pieces. While this asian man is being run up by the shop owner, I give him a tour of some of the other chandeliers. I get this hit that he needs another light. I show him this one chandelier and he\\u2019s gobsmacked in total awe. He doesn\\u2019t even ask the price. He doesn\\u2019t need me to tell him about it. He just knows that it\\u2019s his. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. This is a beautiful piece of art and the healing properties within this one are even more than the one you\\u2019re buying.\\u201d So he takes it to the front to be run up as well. In the meantime, I\\u2019ve cleared out all of the junk from the shop, including all these wet towels that were on the countertops. If you look at the countertops, you can see the outline where the wet towels were. But now they\\u2019re gone. The chandeliers and art are no longer dusty. The dream ends with him taking the chandeliers, very pleased knowing that he\\u2019s going to put this light in his parents\\u2019 flat and they\\u2019re going to be so grateful. It feels like the relationship between me and the shop owner has improved now that things are cleaned and I upsold the chandelier to the Asian man. Suddenly we have an easier connection.\"],[\"At one point I\\u2019m face to face in a conversation with my friend Shawna from high school. She has a fork in her hand and is running it down my skin or is poking my arm with it. She says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re in a major metamorphosis.\\u201d I immediately think of a butterfly when she says this.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been in school learning. I just have a vague impression of being in school. Right now I\\u2019m out. I\\u2019m either looking for food and have bought food from what used to be a McDonald\\u2019s, but things still look weird post-quarantine and there\\u2019s only limited availability. The golden arches sign is no longer available to be used. I\\u2019ve bought boxed cereal and some other items, but they\\u2019re stale. I\\u2019m going back to return them. I\\u2019ve gone inside the building. I have these two big grocery bags with the cereal and other stuff. I go back to the counter and tell the woman who\\u2019s working behind the counter in her viser and McDonald\\u2019s uniform that I\\u2019m returning these. The whole time I\\u2019m thinking that you can\\u2019t return cereal to McDonald\\u2019s, they don\\u2019t do returns. But she takes the cereal and whatever else I have in the bag. I\\u2019m really relieved. It was a big pain in the ass and burden to have all this cereal and other stuff that was stale and I couldn\\u2019t eat and spent money. I was relieved to get my money back, but also surprised. The scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a gigantic empty warehouse. A wedding or birthday is happening - something is being celebrated. But again, things are kind of strange because the crowd is sparse. There is a pastor or somebody doing the marrying or celebrating...or maybe someone has graduated? My friend from high school, Teresa, is there. She\\u2019s all by herself. I see her but she doesn\\u2019t see me yet. It\\u2019s been years and years since we\\u2019ve seen each other and I\\u2019m really excited. But for the moment our focus is on what\\u2019s happening in this party thing. The ceremony concludes and there\\u2019s a handful of other people - some men - one of which I think is her husband and the husband\\u2019s side of the family. I\\u2019m watching because it seems odd that she\\u2019s not hanging out with or sitting next to him. She\\u2019s off by herself. So I go to talk to her and say hello because I haven\\u2019t seen her in forever. She\\u2019s happy to see me and I'm happy to see her. We talk a little about the ceremony that just happened. There\\u2019s some sort of triage that has to happen. Someone is sick or ill and needs some help. I watch her as she helps this person. We\\u2019re still catching up. Then she finishes what she's doing and I ask her: \\u201cSo how is your husband? How is your married life?\\u201d She gives me this look. I look at her fingers to see if she has a wedding ring on. She has multiple rings on. I think one of them is a wedding ring. But she gives me this look and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been the most painful thing I\\u2019ve ever experienced.\\u201d I'm not sure if she\\u2019s still married or not. She says, \\u201cHe cheated on me.\\u201d I can see on her face that she still has pain around being cheated on. I still cannot tell if they\\u2019re still together or not by the way she\\u2019s talking. She is relaying to me the absolute pain she has experienced in finding out her husband cheated on her. I\\u2019m looking at her and am like, \\u201cWell, my husband didn\\u2019t cheat on me, but I\\u2019m no longer married and I\\u2019m in a situation where things are kind of hairy and frustrating and it doesn\\u2019t feel good.\\u201d We talk about that a little bit. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been so long and we have so much to catch up on.\\u201d As she\\u2019s telling me this, she\\u2019s talking really quickly because she has to catch a plane and leave now that the ceremony is over. Again, I\\u2019ve been looking at her fingers for a wedding ring and I\\u2019m also looking to see if she\\u2019s pregnant. I keep thinking she is pregnant, but I can\\u2019t quite tell. She tells me a little bit of her story. I realize that whatever plane she was supposed to catch, she\\u2019s probably missed it or we\\u2019re bending time because it\\u2019s taking awhile for her to tell this story. There is a sense of urgency that she has to go, though. I am feeling that I really want to hear her and witness for her. It seems important to do that. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my two kids and my ex. We are moving out of a high rise condo and back to our old house in Corvallis that has been rented for quite a bit of time. A lot has been moved around and changed in the Corvallis house. We get there and see that there\\u2019s a lot of clean up to do - a lot of stuff that needs to go to the trash. It feels weird and strange because I\\u2019m with my ex who I don\\u2019t really like and he\\u2019s been being an asshole for the last couple months. My focus and attention is on the kids. He\\u2019s sort of cleaning up. He left his computer there, which is weird. Some of the things in the house are things he actually left when we moved and somehow over the years of renting the house, those things stayed - for example his computer, computer speakers and other things. He\\u2019s gathering them all up and getting rid of them. There\\u2019s also stuff that the tenants left on top of the fridge. There\\u2019s a box of baseball gloves and underneath that is a box of mittens and stuff. I\\u2019m looking at all the curtains and see that they\\u2019re all the same curtains that had been there for years. I wonder if anybody has ever washed them. At one point, he goes outside with my son who is younger in this dream - maybe 4, 5 or 6. My ex is chopping down the fence in the backyard and there's this tree growing in the backyard which was not there originally. This is where the home deviates from the home in this reality. There\\u2019s a tree that he is chopping down as well as the fence. All of these fences are coming down. I\\u2019m glad for it because there\\u2019s more space and I like that it feels more open and spacious. But a part of me remembers when he put that fence up and now it\\u2019s interesting that he\\u2019s chopping it down. The inside of the house is getting uncluttered as I carry stuff out. Then our neighbor from across the street comes over and helps us move stuff out. One of the things she carries out is my daughter\\u2019s old desk - it\\u2019s an antique desk that we bought for her when she was little, but it\\u2019s a child\\u2019s desk and too small for her now. The neighbor moves it out and puts it on the street. I can see it through the windows of the house and it\\u2019s sitting on the corner with a free sign. The thought crosses my mind: \\u201cWe paid a lot of money for that antique desk, maybe we should sell it on Craigslist.\\u201d But I\\u2019m just happy to have it out of the house and that more space is becoming available. The last thing I notice is a bed in the middle of the living room and the sheets are the old sheets we had before we moved. I\\u2019m thinking that a lot of people have slept on these sheets and it\\u2019s gross. The sheets and curtains - all these linens - are made of this bright yellow terry cloth material with a blue lace trim along the bottom. I made those a long time ago. I\\u2019m pulling them off to wash them or throw them away because they\\u2019ve been hanging up and lying on this bed for a really long time. Even though I made them, I don\\u2019t want to keep them because I have no idea who\\u2019s been sleeping on these sheets. I toss them. That feels good. The last little bit is when my ex comes back in from chopping down the fence and trees. I had seen his computer and wanted to get on the computer to do some research. I was like, \\u201cOh, a computer. This is helpful. There\\u2019s lots of things I can do with this.\\u201d Instead of us working together to clean up, he gathers up all his stuff and is like, \\u201cThis is mine.\\u201d He leaves with it. The tone of the dream changes from cooperative to him just taking what\\u2019s his and leaving. He leaves and the kids stay with me in the house.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a grocery store and it\\u2019s very dark out. It\\u2019s not night, but there are dark clouds. Everything is dark out and even the grocery store is dark and dreary even though there are fluorescent lights. It\\u2019s pretty packed with people. I have a cart and I\\u2019m shopping for the kids. I\\u2019m doing the week\\u2019s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I\\u2019m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me. I\\u2019m walking through the aisles and my kids and are talking about what they want for dinner. Then my ex shows up and he says, \\u201cWell you can\\u2019t actually have the kids. You\\u2019re not going to get to spend a lot of time with them. You\\u2019re just shopping, then I\\u2019m going to take all of this and leave with the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m fucking pissed that he\\u2019s treating me like that and talking me like that and manipulating the kids in front of me. I can see that they\\u2019re torn because they were just having a great time with me, but when he showed up, their allegiance went straight to him. He\\u2019s saying he\\u2019s just going to take the groceries and all this because he\\u2019s paying for them. I\\u2019m so done with him and seeing the kids frustrated that I say, \\u201cNo, you do it. I\\u2019m out of here. I\\u2019m not going to participate in this.\\u201d The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very \\u201cfuck you\\u2019ish\\u201d way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It\\u2019s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I\\u2019m so mad, but I\\u2019m very clear that I\\u2019m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I\\u2019m not playing his game. I\\u2019m not doing it his way.\"],[\"It\\u2019s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I\\u2019m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It\\u2019s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it\\u2019s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I\\u2019m going in and out of groups and shops. I\\u2019m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it\\u2019s a shop or someone\\u2019s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave and walk out. I\\u2019m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I\\u2019m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I\\u2019m hovering - I\\u2019m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don\\u2019t see me. They\\u2019re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m standing there, but I\\u2019m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they\\u2019re not seeing me. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a lake or the ocean. There\\u2019s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It\\u2019s all outdoors. As I\\u2019m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I\\u2019m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I\\u2019m telling them, \\u201cYes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great\\u201d because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I\\u2019m not going to get any of them because I\\u2019m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They\\u2019ve gotten their cheese and now they\\u2019re at the wine bar ordering wine. I\\u2019m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, \\u201cWe actually have work to do.\\u201d There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There\\u2019s a hose right there. She says, \\u201cI have all these things I have to clean.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I\\u2019ll help you clean these things.\\u201d So we\\u2019re scrubbing containers and tubs. I\\u2019m doing all the scrubbing and she\\u2019s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She\\u2019s really sad. I\\u2019m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn\\u2019t doing a whole lot. She\\u2019s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I\\u2019m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I\\u2019m just doing the motions. There\\u2019s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a piece of property with two houses. There\\u2019s a main house and a secondary building that is smaller and looks like a single-wide, slanted with one side taller than the other. The taller side of this building is all sliding glass windows and you can see into it. The land has eucalyptus trees and a mango tree. It looks kind of tropical but also like California, desert with a lot of oak trees. I\\u2019m with my family - my dad, mom and siblings - and other people who I don\\u2019t recognize, but have the sense they are ancestors. It\\u2019s a gathering. The focus is on this little house with all the sliding doors and glass windows. I can see into it and there are Persian rugs all over and couches. The other house is a grand house that\\u2019s very well appointed, while this house is more humble with a small kitchen off to the left and a bath. I don\\u2019t see any beds, but my dad is telling me that he and friends have stayed there and really liked sleeping there. I can see a fireplace. But I have no idea where they sleep. I see a dining room table and chairs and a couple couches, but again, no beds. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere are you all sleeping? There are no beds and no place to sleep.\\u201d This house is definitely a focus for the moment. Parts of it need fixing up. It doesn\\u2019t have plumbing and they\\u2019re planning on putting plumbing in it. Me and my dad and at least a few other people are gathered around the house and looking at it and talking about it. Then, the scene changes. I\\u2019m with somebody who looks like a young Keanu Reeves and he\\u2019s hurt. He had some sort of accident and is learning to walk again. I\\u2019m watching him getting rehab in the pool with his mom and sister - I have no idea if he has a mom and sister in real life. I\\u2019m watching them encourage him to do his pool exercises of swimming and water jogging so that he regains the full use of his body and legs. He does. At first he starts out really bitter and sullen, but then his demeanor changes as he spends time in the pool. I\\u2019m in the pool with them and I can see him do his exercises. They\\u2019re at one end of the pool and he\\u2019s swimming back and forth to the wall. He reminds me of my brother, too - it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s switching back and forth. He regains full use of his body and gets out of the pool. Then the Rock shows up. I\\u2019m following along with all of this, but can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m actually in the dream or just observing. They climb into a helicopter. There\\u2019s one other person who shows up, but I can\\u2019t remember who it is, although it\\u2019s some movie star. They climb into the helicopter and I\\u2019m afraid that the helicopter isn\\u2019t balanced and if we all get in, it\\u2019s going to tip backwards and fall off the ledge it\\u2019s perched on. The helicopter is all black on the outside. There\\u2019s also a dog. The Rock is the pilot. Keanu Reeves is in the helicopter and ready for an action adventure mission. Then the third person has also climbed in. My fear is that they\\u2019re going to tip over backwards because the helicopter is sitting on a ledge - it\\u2019s not on a super stable helipad. I\\u2019ve followed them into the cockpit but don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m really there because I don\\u2019t have a place to sit and no one is addressing me. They\\u2019re all healthy and ready to go. I\\u2019m hearing mission kind of music playing in my head, so it\\u2019s really like a movie. They\\u2019re going to take off. I think I go with them, but I can\\u2019t remember. Below us is a bunch of water - it\\u2019s like a cliff face with rocks and ocean down below.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a shower stall with Ana. I can\\u2019t remember if our clothes are on or off. We\\u2019re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I\\u2019m looking at her like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re just kind of winging it.\\u201d I wish I could remember more, but there\\u2019s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with my siblings. We\\u2019re all in a big house together and it\\u2019s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We\\u2019re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it\\u2019s just covered in blueberries. We\\u2019re munching on them. We\\u2019re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he\\u2019s not a very smooth driver. So I\\u2019m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he\\u2019s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it\\u2019s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We\\u2019re in a house of some sort but I don\\u2019t recognize it and I don\\u2019t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we\\u2019re all gathered for a wedding. I\\u2019m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he\\u2019s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there\\u2019s no bowl and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cHey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.\\u201d The popcorn starts popping and it\\u2019s endless. I\\u2019m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it\\u2019s going everywhere. It wouldn\\u2019t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I\\u2019m looking down and thinking you can\\u2019t even save this. He\\u2019s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, \\u201cnice way to go, dad,\\u201d and I think my dad is standing there like, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s not a good way to pop popcorn.\\u201d As he\\u2019s sweeping up the popcorn, there\\u2019s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There\\u2019s tons of it and it\\u2019s all over the floor. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what you\\u2019re going to do with all of this. You\\u2019re going to have to throw it away.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make more.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.\\u201d It feels like a waste. There was more to this dream, but I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I can see a pair of motorcycles and a thing that has three wheels, like the comfy ride for old people who want to ride motorcycles, but can\\u2019t stay on two wheels. I\\u2019m observing all of this and don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m in this part of the dream. So these two women riding these motorcycles are pretty fucking badass and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re going pretty fast. There\\u2019s a dude in this three-wheeler behind them. He\\u2019s kind of reckless and pushing him from behind. They\\u2019re weaving in and out of cars and traffic. The feeling of it is really dangerous. There aren\\u2019t a lot of cars. The road itself is going through wheat fields and forest on the other side of the road. The terrain keeps changing as everyone is speeding through this. There\\u2019s also a bus behind that\\u2019s kind of following. I\\u2019m going back and forth between hovering over the motorcycles watching and being in the bus and talking to the bus driver. I\\u2019m watching these motorcycles and at one point I see the guy in the three-wheeler veer off into a wheat field and destroy a bunch of the wheat. Then he comes back onto the road and is still behind these women. The feeling of this part is really intense - the sounds of the motorcycles are really loud in my ear. The wheels of the motorcycles and the three-wheeler are cartoonishly big. There are other passengers in the bus. The inside of the bus is like a school bus, the way the seats are set up, but the outside of the bus doesn\\u2019t look like a school bus. I don\\u2019t know who the bus driver is - it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. He has a wise demeanor about him - he has the feeling of being a guide in this dream. I\\u2019m watching and then the scene cuts away into some sort of night club or bar. I\\u2019m leaning against a bar and talking to these two men whose eyes are a light piercing blue with a light behind them. There\\u2019s definitely flirting going on between us. There\\u2019s a mirror behind the bartender where all the alcohol is sitting on shelves. It\\u2019s dim inside. I know that the people on the motorcycles are safe and fine. I see that the guy that was pushing them on is back on the bus. The bus is now a lab and he\\u2019s standing in this metal cage with rings. The metal cage is very close to his body but not actually touching him. There\\u2019s one ring around his knees, another around his hips and another around his chest. His hands are tied behind him and his body is all bruised. His hair is red. His skin is pretty pale. He\\u2019s yelling as if there\\u2019s some sort of punishment happening to him in this bus that has turned into a lab. So one part of my attention is on that and another part of my attention is with these two guys. It almost feels like they\\u2019re trying to distract me from what\\u2019s happening to this other dude in the bus. I keep seeing electricity coming out from the contraption that he\\u2019s in and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s making him scream. Then just like a scene fades in a movie, the lights go down on the guy in the bus/lab. The lights were an eerie blue and then they fade away totally. I\\u2019m left in the bar and the lights have a red tinge even though they\\u2019re dim.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and my siblings are there as well as my mom and dad. My youngest brother is the one I\\u2019m interacting with. They\\u2019re young, it\\u2019s when they were babies. My ex is there, he\\u2019s somewhere in the mix. My current lover is with me, as well. We\\u2019re trying to clean the bedroom and get my younger brothers ready for school. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I\\u2019m getting frustrated trying to get them ready. My lover and I want to take a shower. We walk into the bathroom and the entire bathroom is covered in shit and grey water and toilet paper. It\\u2019s like a toilet backed up all the way to the ceiling. There are white tiles on the shower wall and the whole bathroom is white, but it\\u2019s covered in this grey old toilet paper and poop. We\\u2019re both standing there barefoot, having walked in and are like, \\u201coh my god, this is so gross,\\u201d but not having another option. We just had to clean it. We\\u2019re both naked and trying to clean it. It\\u2019s just so gross. At one point we fill the whole bathroom with water to wash it all away. Neither of us are happy about it. I have some feelings of embarrassment and I can tell my lover is annoyed, but it\\u2019s just something we have to do. So we clean it. Then we get my little brother off to a race - it\\u2019s like a go-cart race. We get him to the race in time after cleaning the disgusting bathroom. So gross.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger\\u2019s seat. We\\u2019re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I\\u2019m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex\\u2019s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It\\u2019s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she\\u2019s there, but I\\u2019m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There\\u2019s only one white man in the entire house. It\\u2019s so interesting. I\\u2019m noticing all of this. They\\u2019re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There\\u2019s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the \\u201cI feel\\u201d and \\u201cI experience\\u201d and \\u201cWhen this happened, it made me feel like this\\u201d language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It\\u2019s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, \\u201cOh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.\\u201d I start to get this nagging feeling that it\\u2019s time for us to continue on our road trip. I\\u2019ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it\\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. I\\u2019m cleaning up my space. It\\u2019s like an Airbnb, so I\\u2019m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she\\u2019s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I\\u2019m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I\\u2019m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I\\u2019m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it\\u2019s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don\\u2019t, and I change my clothes. I\\u2019m kind of damp. I don\\u2019t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren\\u2019t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.\"],[\"An Asian woman who is shorter than me and is beautiful with long hair down to her waist and a beautiful body and face doesn\\u2019t believe she is beautiful. She keeps saying she\\u2019s not beautiful. I\\u2019m watching her take off her clothes and look at herself in the mirror. As she looks at herself, her legs and hips start to get really big and swollen with fluids like elephantiasis. It\\u2019s just from the waist down. She\\u2019s just telling herself that she looks ugly. There\\u2019s a man in the room with her who keeps telling her, \\u201cNo, no, you look beautiful.\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t believe him. She can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and she can\\u2019t understand him. I\\u2019m watching this interaction and thinking in my head, \\u201cYes, he\\u2019s right. Listen to him!\\u201d But she can\\u2019t hear it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I\\u2019m in. I think I\\u2019m hanging out with family and friends. This Japanese royalty shows up with a lot of people - multiple cars full of Japanese royal family. Up until they arrived, we were all just playing and having a good time. When they arrive, it\\u2019s almost as if they\\u2019re watching us play. There are at least forty or fifty of them. They\\u2019re all sitting at these long tables. I go up to talk to them with the little bit of Japanese I know. This seems to delight everyone. This festival quality comes into the air - celebration is happening. They\\u2019re really happy to observe us having a good time. We\\u2019re going to do some dances and put on a show. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m in my play clothes and they\\u2019re dirty, so I\\u2019m going to go get dressed up for dancing on stage.\\u201d I go to get dressed up and I can\\u2019t find any clothes that I like or that fits or looks good. I find a pair of mom jeans that do not look attractive. Then I look in the mirror and am like, \\u201cWhat is wrong with my face?\\u201d My face looks really old and weird. And my hair is short. I\\u2019ve got this short mom haircut that is not attractive. The hair is dark and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh, what if dyed it?\\u201d So, I think I\\u2019ll dye it blonde. When I look in the mirror my hair is suddenly blonde with crazy root grow out.Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, that doesn\\u2019t look good. I don\\u2019t like that. What if I turn the blonde part pink and the roots turn purple?\\u201d I look in the mirror and sure enough, my hair turns that color. So my hair looks cute, but it\\u2019s kind of straw\\u2019ish - like what happens when you color your hair a lot. But when I look at myself, I think, \\u201cWow, you\\u2019re really trying whatever you can to look cute for these dances on stage, but you don\\u2019t.\\u201d I\\u2019m being pretty harsh on myself. One of my friends, an instructor friend from pole studio, runs in and says, \\u201cThere are only a couple of numbers left. We keep missing you. We\\u2019re ready for you to come dance!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, okay, I\\u2019ll be there. I just need to get some clothes on that look good.\\u201d But I never find anything that looks good. I just go out of this room and can see the stage where they\\u2019re all dancing. I can see the Japanese royalty watching. I watch them dance and miss all the dances. It makes me sad because I really want to dance, but I also feel really not myself, like this mom body, mom haircut, mom face, mom jeans. I don\\u2019t understand why suddenly \\u201cmom\\u201d is a derogatory term in my head. I guess I feel dumpy. So that happens. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a house with a different set of friends and we\\u2019re all sitting on a couch. My friend Aila is there and my other friends who I\\u2019m on council with. We\\u2019re talking about my new relationship. I\\u2019m saying what has happened and how I handled it. I\\u2019m asking if I missed anything or if I handled it in a healthy way. I\\u2019m getting feedback from them. At one point, I ask Aila, \\u201cIs this lust and infatuation and some sort of misguided spiritual projection? Or is this really love?\\u201d Aila looks at me and she says, \\u201cOh no, Rose, it\\u2019s really love.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d and I get up and grab my phone and show her a picture I have of the two of us so she can see. I had a feeling all along that it was really love, too, but there\\u2019s a part of me that is constantly second guessing. But before I can show her the picture, a friend from high school named Janet shows up. Janet is half Japanese, half German. She is like, \\u201cI\\u2019m coming to join the council! I just have these other things to do and I haven\\u2019t gotten to it yet.\\u201d We\\u2019re looking up at her and are like, \\u201cOkay, great. Get here when you get here.\\u201d It seems like a strange interruption because in real life, she\\u2019s not actually part of the council, but it doesn\\u2019t seem to matter. We\\u2019re sitting on this couch in a house and there\\u2019s stuff going on around us with people coming and going, but I don\\u2019t know who the people are or what they\\u2019re doing - it\\u2019s just noise and bodies in the background. Then Janet comes out of that noise and interrupts and disappears again.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with two guys, one of them is Josh. We\\u2019re at a zoo. We\\u2019re looking at the displays and I\\u2019m sad about animals being in the zoo. But, I don't actually see any animals. The displays are all empty. I walk into one of them and am trying to show Josh and the other guy, maybe he\\u2019s my brother, that your eyesight is limited from the point of view of the animal. I\\u2019ve walked into the display area and am looking out to where the crowds would be standing. I say, \\u201cSee you can only see so much if you\\u2019re in here.\\u201d I try to show them this. Then I turn around and it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s an inside part of these displays that opens up into a huge cylinder shaped room that opens up to the sky. Inside are more cages and laboratories and places for the animals. I want to explore this. The other two come in with me. We\\u2019re curious. We don't know exactly what is happening in this area of the zoo. I still can\\u2019t see any animals. Except, as I get closer, I\\u2019m looking at a lot of metal and cages and fluorescent lights. As I\\u2019m looking, these tiny, maybe three inches tall, koala bears show up. They\\u2019re climbing this little bird stand with the wide dish at the bottom for bird seed. There isn't a cage around it, though. The tiny koalas are hyper and all over the place. This scientist zoologist comes out with a black house cat (his familiar?) and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! I want to hold this tiny koala!\\u201d The scientist says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the tiny koala. They\\u2019re on something. I don\\u2019t know what they might do to you. They might bite you. They might scratch you. So just leave them alone.\\u201d So I just look at them. At first there was one, then there were two, then there were like fifty of them swarming this little stand. They are moving kind of crazily. I back up a little bit. We\\u2019re just poking around this inside place and looking for other animals. I get a sense that there are other things we could be doing than this. The scene changes. I don't know what happens to the other two. I\\u2019m in this outdoor area that reminds me of a college campus. There\\u2019s a football team going by. It\\u2019s Fall, leaves are falling, there are leaves on the ground and it\\u2019s kind of chilly. I\\u2019m wearing shorts and a shirt. A lot of the football players are classmates from school, but there are also a bunch of them that I don\\u2019t recognize. As the football team files past me some of them who are my old classmates say hi. They\\u2019re really excited to see me. I realize this is because I\\u2019m wearing velvet bootie shorts and a tiny little crop top. So, they seem like they\\u2019re happy to see me but I think it\\u2019s just because of what I\\u2019m wearing. Somehow I\\u2019m wearing this because it\\u2019s one of those fall days where it\\u2019s still pretty warm in the middle of the day. Apparently the temperature isn\\u2019t bothering me. I turn around and go to this larger grassy area where there are a bunch of people gathered. They\\u2019re all on their own blankets. I go to the spot with a bunch of friends. I don't recognize all the people on the blanket but I get the sense that I know them because they say, \\u201cHey Rose!\\u201d and I sit down and we\\u2019re talking. At one point, Ana shows up with her son. They are so brown - their skin is so dark and they\\u2019re totally naked! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThose two have been out in the sun all summer! I\\u2019m jealous!\\u201d They\\u2019re the only two who are naked. The rest of us have some kind of clothing on. But the thing that stands out is how tan the two of them are. Then, I leave the blanket and go into a house or something. I\\u2019m heading towards the inside and set up a lawn chair for myself. Then someone wants to talk to me and I get distracted and go elsewhere. I do the interaction but don\\u2019t remember what it is. I think it\\u2019s a football player who was one of my old classmates and wants to talk. He tries to convince me to come watch the game or go to some sort of after party. I finish that interaction and go back to sit in my chair, but someone is in my chair. This happens like three times where I go talk to someone and go back to my chair, but the chair I\\u2019ve set up for myself, someone else is in it. The first two times I get a new chair. The third time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYo, that\\u2019s my chair! Get out. I set that up for me.\\u201d The person who is in it this last time is a cranky older gentleman. He maybe needs the chair more than I do. I\\u2019m pissed off about losing my chair yet again, but thinking maybe he actually needs it. Then again, one more football player comes over and wants to talk to me. It\\u2019s like they all want to spend time with me and go on a date. They want me to come to their football games and just be around them. There\\u2019s a funny earnestness and innocence in the way they\\u2019re showing up to try and get my attention. It\\u2019s not creepy at all. They\\u2019re not trying to be players or extra smooth. They just really want me around. They want my energy around. It\\u2019s funny.\"],[\"The first part of the dream is a bunch of kids who seem young, maybe twelve or thirteen. I\\u2019m in the mix and my body might be twelve or thirteen but my brain is definitely an adult\\u2019s brain. We\\u2019re at this boarding school. There are six of us who are learning how to be astronauts. We\\u2019re wandering around and we find this office with all of the gear we would need to get on the spaceship, fly it, and head to the moon. So we\\u2019re collecting all this stuff. It\\u2019s stuff that the other astronauts who have already been to the moon have used. It\\u2019s their things. We\\u2019re collecting it because we\\u2019re going to go. I\\u2019m simultaneously one of the kids collecting the things and also the adult going, \\u201cOh gosh, these kids are going to kill themselves. It\\u2019s not safe. I need to stop them.\\u201d I\\u2019m playing both roles, which is weird. The enthusiasm of the kids is really high and cute. But it\\u2019s not feasible for them to suddenly get on a spaceship and head up to space because they\\u2019re twelve. They have all their things. I don\\u2019t know if their professors or the actual astronauts find us in their office. We snuck in. there\\u2019s a sense that we shouldn\\u2019t be there. They come in. It's two or three of the astronauts who are also teachers. They sit down and I can tell they know what we\\u2019re trying to do and there\\u2019s no way in hell it\\u2019s going to happen. But they indulge us. They are asking the kids all these questions: \\u201cHow are you going to do this, this and this? How are you going to take care of this? What food are you going to eat? The food question is funny because we\\u2019re all actually eating food and some of the kids are wanting to share the food with the astronauts. I can tell that the other kids are not aware that these teachers are the actual astronauts. They haven\\u2019t put that together yet. I\\u2019m watching all of this and also in the conversation and offering some of my food to one of the astronauts even though I know they\\u2019re going to say no. the reason they\\u2019re asking all these questions is that at some point they\\u2019re going to say we can\\u2019t do all this stuff because we\\u2019re not prepared. We are sitting around a rounded desk. This goes on for a while. The scene changes. We never get on a spaceship or anything. The teachers/astronauts never say, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re not going,\\u201d or \\u201cYou\\u2019re in trouble for breaking into the office.\\u201d I keep waiting for that to happen and it doesn\\u2019t happen. It\\u2019s like the astronauts are so bemused by the excitement and enthusiasm of the kids that they let it play out. Then I am hanging with Johnny and Amanda again - I\\u2019ve known both of them since second grade. They were married seven or eight years ago and now have a couple kids. Johnny is the leader again. He has a group of people with him. I don\\u2019t recognize all the people, but I do see Amanda there. He\\u2019s pretty upbeat and everybody is excited to be there. We are outside in my backyard somehow. At one point, I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s moving around the crowd. He comes to me and picks me up. We\\u2019re holding hands and our arms are locked. I\\u2019m using all of my muscles to stay upright. He\\u2019s moving me around like in acroyoga. I am thinking how this takes a lot of shoulder strength to hold me up like this. It takes a lot of shoulder strength on my end to hold myself up like this, too! Everybody is having a good time. Then suddenly it\\u2019s time to go. It\\u2019s time to move on. It\\u2019s time for Johnny to move his group of people and I\\u2019m with them. Now I have a pair of roller skates on. There are a couple other other moms in this group as well, and they also have roller skates on. There are younger kids with roller skates on. There are moms wearing their kids. I think Amanda is wearing a baby. I watch them go. I think I should also grab my tennis shoes in case we have to go uphill or we have to go inside where roller skates are not a good idea. So I\\u2019m watching them go and decide to go with them first because I want to see where they go. I forget to get my shoes. I can feel how fast I\\u2019m gliding in these roller skates and it\\u2019s a lot of fun. There are other moms in this group. I\\u2019m at the back of the crowd. We are skating down streets but the streets are cracked and there\\u2019s grass growing up out of the streets. So it\\u2019s not super smooth. I realize I really do need to get my shoes. The group is going really slow so I do have time to skate back to my place and grab my shoes. Wherever we\\u2019re going, we are leaving these places for good. We aren\\u2019t coming back. I leave the group and it kind of feels a little bit painful but I know I\\u2019ll be able to find them because I\\u2019m on roller skates and I\\u2019m going faster than they are. I know I\\u2019ll be able to hear them. So I roller skate back to my house up this hill. I\\u2019m going really fast. I grab my tennis shoes and put them in this backpack. Instead of going the way I came with the group, I cut across all of these streets. The streets remind me of the streets around the college I went to - residential area for college students and professors. There are tall trees. The cracks in the sidewalk are still there. Things look kind of old and there is ivy growing on things. There are lots of flowers on the lawns. Then I get to an apartment complex with multiple levels. All of these levels are connected by stairs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, stairs and roller skates, not going to happen.\\u201d So I put my tennis shoes on. I can hear the group. Johnny is shepherding them at this point. My friend Ikaika who I have also known since second grade and grew up with is now in the group, too. They\\u2019re trying to go up one of the sets of stairs on the outside of the apartment building. There is a younger woman - well, she\\u2019s the same age as everyone in the group, we\\u2019re all younger than we are in real life, maybe in our twenties or early thirties. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, you cannot take this entire group through this apartment complex and go up these stairs.\\u201d It\\u2019s interesting because the streets I\\u2019m on are two or three levels above where the group is trying to climb the stairs to get up to these streets. So they\\u2019re definitely at a lower level of the road or something. Johnny is trying to bring them up the stairs and Ikaika is trying as well. Those two are super frustrated. I go and talk to the young woman. But I have to go through somebody\\u2019s apartment. It\\u2019s a college apartment so there are four people crammed into this tiny apartment and this is why the woman is saying, \\u201cNo, stop trying to bring this group of people up through this. It\\u2019s small and there\\u2019s not enough room for them! And you\\u2019re disturbing all of us who live here. You\\u2019re not taking into account the fact that we live here. You are singing loudly. You have kids. You have roller skates on.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her and she is pissed off. She\\u2019s not having it. She has blond hair down to her shoulders. Her skin is tan. She looks a bit ratty, not well kept. I go to talk to Johnny and Ikaika and say, \\u201cYou guys, we can go around. We don\\u2019t need to go through these peoples\\u2019 homes to get up to this next level.\\u201d They are so frustrated. They can\\u2019t see any other way than to come up the stairs. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, lets\\u2019 go around. There\\u2019s a road over here you can go up.\\u201d The dream ends here at an impasse with all these people trying to come up and this one girl trying to keep them out. I\\u2019m trying to convince them to go up around this road. No one arrives at a solution.\"],[\"I am outside. I keep going into a building but I\\u2019m not supposed to be inside because it\\u2019s reserved for other people. A convention or something is happening. I see my hula halau there - my kumu hula and all my hula sisters. They\\u2019re going to do a show. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome dance with us.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and am like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember any of the dances.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don\\u2019t remember the dances. They also don\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s like we haven\\u2019t practiced in a long time and we haven\\u2019t gotten together in a long time. But we\\u2019re all getting together for this. I feel so awkward. It\\u2019s really just affording me a reason for me to be in this building that I need or just want to be in. I\\u2019m not sure why. The halau is getting ready. I think I\\u2019m still in costume. I hide from them. I climb up a balcony or something. I\\u2019m not even taking stairs. I\\u2019m climbing things and definitely trespassing. I get to a classroom and it\\u2019s a kindergarten classroom. All the kindergarten decor is in there. I\\u2019m hiding in there. I think the teacher is trying to get the classroom ready because there aren\\u2019t a lot of kids. But there are some kids, so I think maybe it\\u2019s a school. I need to use the bathroom and it\\u2019s a little kid\\u2019s bathroom so the toilet is just two feet off the ground. I come out and have these feelings that I shouldn\\u2019t be here but don\\u2019t know why I need to be there. I head out of the classroom and climb back down and head back to the hula sisters. We do perform but I don\\u2019t know if I actually perform with them or watch. I wake up with this sense of not knowing what\\u2019s going on, I shouldn\\u2019t be here, I don\\u2019t have the skills, I don\\u2019t remember the dances, and none of this is my scene.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Josh, my beloved. We\\u2019re going to a Dane Cook show - the compedian (I haven\\u2019t listened to his shit in at least ten years). We\\u2019re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It\\u2019s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They\\u2019re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It\\u2019s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he\\u2019s done. I\\u2019m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it\\u2019s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term \\u201csausage fest\\u201d is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I\\u2019m a little confused as to why I\\u2019m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he\\u2019s finished with the set. He\\u2019s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, \\u201cWell, because you\\u2019re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, whatever!\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don\\u2019t know if Josh is still with me. I\\u2019m watching a soccer game. It\\u2019s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They\\u2019re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I\\u2019m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I\\u2019m not playing, I\\u2019m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I\\u2019m not sure who the team is that we\\u2019re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I\\u2019m wanting to play so bad. We\\u2019re outdoors at a soccer field and I\\u2019m actually sitting under a tree, it\\u2019s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I\\u2019m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I\\u2019m not playing and I\\u2019m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I\\u2019m not invited to play and it\\u2019s been a really long time since I\\u2019ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there\\u2019s busy work that has to happen. I\\u2019m watching the field morph. I can\\u2019t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I\\u2019m not part of it and I\\u2019m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don\\u2019t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. There\\u2019s my other friend Nani who I\\u2019ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m busy and I\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d She does sit with me for a little bit. While we\\u2019re sitting there, another girl comes up - I\\u2019m saying \\u201cgirl\\u201d because everyone is a teenager - and she\\u2019s got a project she\\u2019s working on. I ask her to show me. There\\u2019s wire wrapped around a needle and she\\u2019s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: \\u201cI can show you but I\\u2019m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.\\u201d It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s almost off work with the job she\\u2019s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she\\u2019s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, \\u201cOkay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you\\u2019re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.\\u201d She\\u2019s a local girl, so I can feel this air of \\u201cIck, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?\\u201d That\\u2019s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I am with my ex and his dad and some other family members, maybe some are my family members. I have to go do something but I\\u2019ve forgotten all my stuff. I turn to my ex and ask him to go get the things that I\\u2019m missing. The whole time I\\u2019m asking him, part of me is like, \\u201cWhy are you asking him for things? He can\\u2019t give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to do anything for you. Don\\u2019t ask him. Just do the things. If you do, you\\u2019ll owe him and that will make things worse.\\u201d I keep seeing this backpack full of things. He either has it or I have it, I\\u2019m not entirely sure. He does bring it to me. But the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, don\\u2019t accept this from him because then you will owe and you\\u2019ll never be free of him.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re younger, maybe early twenties. We\\u2019re gathered from all parts of the globe. It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There\\u2019s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cFor all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I signed up to be a bad guy.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We\\u2019re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She\\u2019s down below me and there\\u2019s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I\\u2019m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I\\u2019m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from \\u201cLilo and Stitch.\\u201d She\\u2019s talking to it and petting it while she\\u2019s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn\\u2019t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn\\u2019t have one, but I said, \\u201cThanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.\\u201d He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly understand that this meeting was about who was going to end up with one of those animals, like what she has. She moves on. I stand up and follow her into the kitchen. She\\u2019s moving as if she\\u2019s very busy and has to move onto the next task. The kitchen is also an office and there\\u2019s a huge fish tank. She is already giving instructions to someone else. I come up to her and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one of those things that you guys can create for me.\\u201d She stops talking and has a grin on her face and is like, \\u201cWell actually, you my dear, have enough power for three of these.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little taken aback and surprised. This woman has dark hair and reminds me a little bit of Helen but she\\u2019s not. They correlate to emotional superpowers, one is my ability to laugh and smile - at some point this thing smiled at me with all its sharp pointy teeth. She says, \\u201cYes, and you have two others.\\u201d There's something about shadow and something about fighting, warrior spirit. We all pile into cars and drive somewhere. I\\u2019m with my friend from the grocery store. We drive to a large gathering for all of us.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a house with a bunch of people. It\\u2019s kind of like an Airbnb we\\u2019ve rented. I don\\u2019t recognize all the people. I\\u2019m uncomfortable, for sure. I don't know what we\\u2019re doing in the house. There\\u2019s something we\\u2019re supposed to be doing as a group. I end up leaving the house. I go somewhere else. The house is in a city. I don\\u2019t know where I go, but I find myself trying to make my way back to the house but then driving a car. My dad is in the car and we\\u2019re going into the city through the backway to avoid the traffic and major roads. He\\u2019s in the passenger seat and asking me if I know where I\\u2019m going. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah dad, thanks, just be quiet and follow along. Don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make it to our conference.\\u201d But the GPS navigates me back to the house I had been at. This house had a lot next door to it with a rundown house and a bunch of land that was run down. When we get back, the house next door that was run down now is occupied by a cute lesbian couple. They\\u2019re bakers. They\\u2019ve fixed up the house. The gardens are all fixed up. They have right down the road an off the charts bakery that\\u2019s super fantastic. So we get there and my dad\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t where we\\u2019re supposed to be.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I know. But the upside of this is this bakery is available to us and we need to stop and get water anyway.\\u201d So we go into the bakery. The floors are wood. There\\u2019s a section with the bakery case. It\\u2019s packed! There are so many people - tourists from all over the place and locals. I go in and we walk up to the counter. I say, \\u201cI hear you guys are famous. Do you have grain-free and dairy-free desserts? I can\\u2019t eat those other things.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cIn fact, we do.\\u201d So they take me down to the far end of the case and show me the items that I can have. I\\u2019m so excited about it. My dad\\u2019s excited about it, too. We order the items we can order. But it takes a while for them to get them to us because there are so many people who have ordered and there are so many people in front of us. We wander off from the area to grab a water out of these coolers. There are drink coolers that seem out of place because the bakery is super cute, like a French bakery feel, but off in the corner with tables for eating is a Coca Cola drink cooler. It looks so out of place! I grab a water but am like, \\u201cEh, what are these doing here?\\u201d The tables are super close together. I\\u2019m trying to get through the tables and keep running into people. In my mind I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is not coronavirus six feet.\\u201d But no one is wearing masks and everyone is close. As I go through, there\\u2019s a table with an Asian woman sitting, and there\\u2019s a black man sitting at a table next to it. I\\u2019m trying to go in between them, but I\\u2019m rubbing legs with both of them to get to the drink cooler. The Asian woman gives me a dirty look. The black man is like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019ll get out of the way,\\u201d but he\\u2019s giving me this mischievous grin and there\\u2019s a twinkle in his eye because we\\u2019re touching. I grin at both of them and just say \\u201cexcuse me,\\u201d and go to the drink cooler and get a water for me and a soda for my dad. I go back through the big group. It\\u2019s still super crowded. I go back to the case where they\\u2019re handing out the desserts. I get there and am like, \\u201cHey do you have my dessert?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe called you and you didn\\u2019t come. It\\u2019s taken us a while, but we have it.\\u201d I\\u2019m kind of getting scolded, but they give it to me anyway. It doesn\\u2019t look as pretty as it would have because it\\u2019s been sitting for a little bit. I\\u2019m a little disappointed, but I take it anyway. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFor sure, for sure, this is dairy-free and grain-free?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYep.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and am like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s full of dairy if I\\u2019ve ever seen a dessert full of dairy.\\u201d But I take it anyway. I\\u2019m going to head out and eat it. Then I sort of wake up because in real life the wind blows so hard it rattles the trees at my window. It\\u2019s very startling, but I fall back to sleep and dream some more. But that\\u2019s all I can remember.\"],[\"I am hosting a party. I\\u2019m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There\\u2019s a fireplace. There\\u2019s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I\\u2019m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We\\u2019re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they\\u2019re here at the party for a reason, but there\\u2019s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don\\u2019t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what\\u2019s up. They\\u2019ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There\\u2019s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what\\u2019s being discussed, but it seems like there\\u2019s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don\\u2019t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what\\u2019s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we\\u2019ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. Let\\u2019s do that. We\\u2019ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.\\u201d It must be cold outside because there\\u2019s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What\\u2019s funny is they didn\\u2019t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it\\u2019s freezing. So there\\u2019s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don\\u2019t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they\\u2019ll put them near the fire. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I\\u2019ll just go put them in the fire.\\u201d But the shoes don\\u2019t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they\\u2019re wearing are mismatched. There\\u2019s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There\\u2019s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I\\u2019m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It\\u2019s like somehow we\\u2019ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it\\u2019s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they\\u2019re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it\\u2019s just me in the end. I\\u2019m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can\\u2019t remember what the changes are now. I\\u2019m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I\\u2019m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not a good idea. You\\u2019re a woman, this isn\\u2019t a good idea for you.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they\\u2019re leaving telling him: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She\\u2019s going to do what she\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn\\u2019t have to say and stop trying to control her. I\\u2019m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn\\u2019t being heard by my dad. I couldn\\u2019t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I\\u2019m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I\\u2019m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss\\u2019 artwork but the customer\\u2019s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I\\u2019m printing it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t your artwork.\\u201d She comes and looks at it and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely not.\\u201d There are huge instructions in the order and I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cNo. We don\\u2019t print other people\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m not going to do this.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d We look over and there are packages with more of this customer\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.\\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I\\u2019m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they\\u2019re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, \\u201cOh, who is that?!\\u201d My friend is there, too, and I think she\\u2019s in the room with somebody, but she\\u2019s not because she\\u2019s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn\\u2019t her. We\\u2019re all like, \\u201cWho was that?!\\u201d We walk down the hall and it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don\\u2019t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey can I get one of those? I want a turn!\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he\\u2019s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I look at him like, \\u201cCan I get a turn?\\u201d and he blushes and is like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the living room of my childhood home. There are a ton of people coming and going; some of them are my siblings, some are my siblings\\u2019 classmates, and I think some are my classmates, too. They\\u2019re all on a mission of some sort. I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing, but they\\u2019re coming home from some event they were at or some project they were doing. There are a lot of people, at least twenty, in the living room and more people outside. At one point I see a huge outrigger canoe being rolled through the yard and into the living room, which magically expands to fit it. I\\u2019m lying on a couch and pretty tired. I\\u2019m exhausted and just watching them come and go. People are stopping to talk with me but I\\u2019m not really involved in whatever is happening or whatever mission they seem to be on. At one point I sit up and look out to the driveway and the hedge that separates our house from the neighbor house. Behind the hedge is a gigantic tree with a treehouse in it. It looks like an oak tree in the way the trunk and branches are growing but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an oak because this is Hawaii. I\\u2019m watching people climb up and down the tree - it\\u2019s a treehouse but also an obstacle course with places where you can work out. It\\u2019s all somehow in this tree. I\\u2019m watching other people working out. Then I see a real tiger, orange and black, climb the tree and do the workout. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhoa, I didn\\u2019t know tigers could move like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m watching the tiger the whole time because I\\u2019m fascinated by what it\\u2019s doing and how it can do it, and also that it seems to be listening to the people. It\\u2019s as if it\\u2019s taking instructions from the humans - maybe not verbally, but from watching and then doing what they\\u2019re doing. Then the tiger climbs out of the tree and I think it\\u2019s going into the house through the backdoor. It\\u2019s at the backdoor and doing pullups on this pullup bar in the door. I see my brother (the one with the sustained traumatic brain injury in real life, but in the dream he\\u2019s normal and doesn\\u2019t have it). He is trying to pick up the tiger and use the tiger as a weight. The tiger is getting pissed off about this and doesn\\u2019t like it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMaybe you should put the tiger down.\\u201d He figures it out on his own. This whole time, the tiger is the most fascinating thing even though there are other people around. The tiger is acting like a tiger but also like a human. At some point it does come up to me and I just look at it and it looks at me, but I don\\u2019t hear anything and it doesn\\u2019t give me any verbal messages. I just know we have a moment of looking at each other. This part of the dream dissolves. Now I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood. I\\u2019m young, maybe five or six. There are two houses. I go into one house and there are a bunch of younger kids and two dads. I\\u2019m now my current age. The moms are not there and the dads don\\u2019t know how to feed the kids. They\\u2019re both watching tv, but then they see me and are like, \\u201cOh good! A woman to take care of things.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? No.\\u201d I walk out of the house. Then I walk down the street in this neighborhood -I\\u2019m definitely in the suburbs. I walk into the second house. This house is dark and dingy. There\\u2019s at least one man in here and maybe some kids. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw, danger.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to be in there. I can tell it\\u2019s not the place for me. There\\u2019s nothing here for me. This whole time I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood, I\\u2019m looking for something but I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m looking for. I do know that this house is not it. I leave that house and go back to the other house. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well I guess I will help you guys out because you\\u2019re better than the other house.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat, we need a pie made.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOkay, well show me all the stuff.\\u201d As soon as I say yes to making the pie, the dads pulls out this box of frozen foods they weren\\u2019t feeding the kids until they had permission from me. It\\u2019s a box of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fish sticks and frozen pizzas - basically junk food. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat now we can eat all this stuff and feed the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh god, this is a terrible idea. Where is the stuff to make the pie. I\\u2019ll make the pie and at least that will be good.\\u201d They show me this piece of cardboard with perforated cutouts of leaves and vines. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with it but I start pushing those through because I think I\\u2019ll maybe use them for the pie. Then the dads want to start talking business and how they\\u2019re going to pay me for this work. They hand me a leather jump rope with wooden handles. It\\u2019s folded four times. I have it in my hands and they\\u2019re talking about payment. As I\\u2019m listening I think they\\u2019ve got it all wrong. They don\\u2019t know how much labor is worth or how the pay schedule works. I\\u2019m talking about financial investments and using the jump rope to help explain. I\\u2019m untying the rope to show them how payment works. This is the most bizarre part of the dream because I don\\u2019t remember what I was saying or how a jump rope relates to finance, but somehow it did.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been asked to start and run a restaurant. The bare bones of the restaurant are in place - there\\u2019s a kitchen and a place for people to eat and a menu that I created. But there\\u2019s no staff. I have to do the cooking, serving and cleaning up all at once. The people who are eating know this is an experiment. There are three tables of people. They\\u2019re all putting in their orders and are very expectant. It\\u2019s just me. And there\\u2019s one other person who\\u2019s watching me and helping me a little, waiting for my direction, but more observing. I\\u2019m panicked because there\\u2019s too much to do. There\\u2019s no way to cook and serve and clear the tables and get everyone\\u2019s order and fill the water glasses all at the same time. It\\u2019s just too much. I\\u2019m trying as hard as I can. Everything is white in this restaurant - white table cloths, white walls, white floor - and part of it seems outdoors, there is no ceiling. After the meal is entirely served and I\\u2019m all done, the tables have nothing but complaints about the service, the food and how terrible everything was. I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou all volunteered for this and you knew that it was just me and I said it was not going to do all the things. But you guys all wanted this and you did it anyway. And now you\\u2019re critiquing me for it when I told you it wasn\\u2019t possible for me to do everything and I would need help.\\u201d I was panicked and frustrated.\"],[\"I\\u2019m looking at my phone and I\\u2019m with Josh and getting texts from Hank. Hank and Wendy used to co-own the CrossFit gym I used to go to. Hank is texting me about meeting up with him. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with him and think it\\u2019s weird that he\\u2019s even texting me. I say yes even though I don\\u2019t know what he wants. The scene shifts from me looking at my phone to being at a coffee shop. I\\u2019m with Josh and we\\u2019re hanging out. I have this feeling that Hank is going to meet up with me here and Wend6 is going to be there, too. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with them and don\\u2019t know why I agreed to meet with them. But I very distinctly remember seeing the text message where I said, \\u201cOkay great,\\u201d to Hank\\u2019s request to meet me somewhere. They both show up. I see Wendy first. She doesn\\u2019t seem like herself. She\\u2019s actually really happy and her hair is dyed blond. She has a smile on her face. She says hi to me. I\\u2019m wary like who is this and why is she saying hi. But she says hi then goes on with her business. She has her kids and she\\u2019s meeting a friend. Hank shows up and goes to give me a creepy hug like he used to give me. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh don\\u2019t, Josh is right there and he\\u2019s not going to like that. I don\\u2019t even know why I\\u2019m meeting with you and why I said yes. Don\\u2019t hug me in that creepy way.\\u201d The hug is like the lingering kind with lingering hands. Hank is also really happy to see me. I\\u2019m hesitant and I can see that Josh is wondering what\\u2019s going on here. Josh is looking less and less like himself as the dream progresses. He\\u2019s sitting at a table sitting out towards the coffee shop on a bench. There\\u2019s a chair on the other side of the table facing him and the chair is where I was going to sit, but that\\u2019s where Hank wants to sit and talk. I have all this hesitation about meeting up with them. Then the scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a Jeep. I'm driving around. It\\u2019s either Wendy\\u2019s or somebody\\u2019s. Josh is in the passenger seat and he\\u2019s upset and is like, \\u201cWhy did you meet with them?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember the gist of the conversation, just the feeling that he wasn\\u2019t happy with me and I was confused that I would agree to meet with them and confused by their super friendly reaction to me when I don\\u2019t think they would be friendly in real life.\"],[\"I wake up in the morning at my house and decide to take myself out to breakfast or lunch at a restaurant. I get all dressed up so I have earrings and all these rings with diamonds. One of the rings has a bigger diamond with smaller diamonds all around it. It looks like an antique setting and it\\u2019s really gorgeous. I go to this restaurant but it\\u2019s not even open yet. The servers are there and getting ready for the day. For whatever reason, one of the servers lets me in and he waits on me. He sits me at a table a little out of the way so they can keep getting ready for when they actually open. There\\u2019s a cook in the kitchen, a woman. The server is a guy. I start ordering off the menu. I order all kinds of food that I normally wouldn\\u2019t be able to eat, like pasta. At one point, I take my earrings off and they turn into fuzzy caterpillars. I also take my rings off and set them down on the table. The tablecloth is red and white checkered. I start to eat my pasta and it has marinara sauce on it. Then the server and cook come and sit down with me and have their pre-shift snack. So they\\u2019re eating with me. I think they\\u2019re eating the pasta, too. The noodles are the short curly noodles. We\\u2019re having a conversation and I\\u2019m realizing that they went out of their way to feed me even though they aren\\u2019t even open. Then I suddenly realize I\\u2019m eating pasta and maybe I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that. It doesn\\u2019t cross my mind until after I\\u2019ve eaten almost the whole bowl that this might have consequences. I finish. They clear the table and I grab all my rings and put them back on. I go to put my earrings back on but I can\\u2019t find them - the caterpillars. I\\u2019m still hanging out at the restaurant as the rest of the servers and bussers show up along with everyone who is there to help open. I move myself to a table at the edge of the restaurant so I\\u2019m out of the way while I try to put all my jewelry back on. I\\u2019m just watching as everyone gets ready. They\\u2019re all interacting with each other, laughing and playing and having a good time while they do their work. I feel kind of awkward the whole time because they\\u2019re not even open yet and here I am. The servers, men and women, talk with me and interact with me. I find myself remembering what it was like when I used to be a server and wondering how much they make in tips in cash each night and what they do with it - whether or not they report the cash tip or just the credit card tips to avoid taxes being taken out. The restaurant finally opens. I have a flash of seeing a football team playing a game from this table where I\\u2019m at. I look out of the restaurant over a field to where the football players are playing a game. I\\u2019m still trying to find my earrings and I can't find them. I\\u2019m trying to fit the big antique ring with the huge diamond and the smaller diamonds around it on my finger but I can\\u2019t quite get it on. All the rings are on my left hand and on all the fingers except my thumb. I\\u2019m trying to fit this older antique ring over my wedding ring finger and I don\\u2019t quite get it on, but I\\u2019m holding onto it so I don\\u2019t lose the ring.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in my condo. It\\u2019s dark and it\\u2019s Friday night. I\\u2019ve just taken the kids to their dad\\u2019s. I\\u2019m looking forward to having time to myself and time with Josh. I hear a noise. I get up out of bed and go out into the living room, which is pitch black. My son and brother are on the couch but they\\u2019re both young, like six or seven. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cDad just dropped us off.\\u201d I\\u2019m so confused because I just dropped them off at their dad\\u2019s house and I\\u2019m supposed to have all this time to myself and here they are and they\\u2019re sick. I\\u2019m trying to text my ex, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to have the kids right now. They\\u2019re sick. You left them here. I have plans for this weekend. It\\u2019s not my time with them.\\u201d My ex comes down from the stairs and starts telling me something. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care what your story is and I don\\u2019t know why you\\u2019re in my house but you need to take the kids out.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling super upset and start to feel that I have a sore throat in real life, as if whatever is happening in the dream is actually physically affecting me like I\\u2019m going to catch strep or something. This is something that did happen a lot when I was with my ex because he\\u2019s a strep carrier. In the dream, the kids are hot and sick and their voices are scratchy. I can tell they feel lonely because I\\u2019m trying to text their dad to come get the kids and then he shows up and argues with me about how I have to keep them. Then I start to get the sore throat in real life. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m with Josh at his house. He drinks coffee in the morning and I drink matcha. I\\u2019m trying to make my matcha and there are all these coffee mugs all over the counter and dirty dishes and water in the sink with soap and dishes in it and dishes in the strainer. I think I poured my matcha into a mug but it\\u2019s actually a glass and it\\u2019s hot so that\\u2019s not going to work because there\\u2019s no handle on the glass. I\\u2019m watching Josh drink his coffee. He\\u2019s drinking out of a cup with the Sun Tarot card on the front. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, I want a better mug for my matcha that has a Tarot card on it.\\u201d I look in the cupboard and see one with the Lovers on it. There\\u2019s a random Six of Swords, too. I take the Lovers, obviously. I go to switch mugs and stop and do the dishes. Josh is trying to tend to me but he\\u2019s a little distracted because his dad\\u2019s in the house and his sister is in the house. His sister has some friends there and his dad has some friends. There are people in the house who are supposedly friends of mine but I don\\u2019t recognize them. The house doesn\\u2019t look like Josh\\u2019s actual house. I go out into the dining room where everyone is. The dining room is dark and there\\u2019s a big long heavy wooden table that sits ten or twelve. The legs are thick and super sturdy and there are benches on either side. I see a bunch of younger kids hanging around. I\\u2019m feeling out of place because I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing there and I don\\u2019t really know anyone else. I think they\\u2019re Josh\\u2019s friends from before when he lived in Ohio. He\\u2019s talking with them and I\\u2019m trying to pay attention and be part of it, but I still don't have my matcha the way I want it. I go back into the kitchen to try and get it in a cup. I go to pick it up and the cup is leaking so it\\u2019s spilling everywhere. Josh tries to help me and I get the sense that he\\u2019s irritated with me because he\\u2019s trying to caretake me but also missing out on interacting with his friends. The scene shifts. Instead of being in a house, now we\\u2019re on a soccer field. It\\u2019s outdoors but there are lectures happening and it\\u2019s a bunch of Waldorf teachers lecturing. What\\u2019s so weird about this is Josh and his friends, who are all thugs because they started doing drugs when they were twelve and drinking and smoking, and then there\\u2019s me sitting in this little camping chair. A lot of people are sitting in those kinds of chairs. There are also some of my friends who are younger and parents who are my age with children. There\\u2019s one Waldorf teacher who I hired to tutor my daughter when she was younger. She is writing on the chalkboard, making beautiful pictures all in one fluid motion. I realize her piece of chalk which is a fat square is patterned, so as she writes the pattern on the chalk comes out onto the chalkboard. That doesn\\u2019t exist in real life as far as I know, but in the dream it does and it\\u2019s totally rad. She finishes her lecture and writing. I\\u2019m mouthing at her: \\u201cCan I see the chalk?\\u201d She hands it over. At some point I\\u2019m holding a baby, it\\u2019s not mine. It\\u2019s a three month old infant. There are also cats and dogs around. I don\\u2019t know who the baby belongs to, but I\\u2019m going to take care of it and watch over it and whoever\\u2019s it is will come eventually. I put the baby down onto the chair and go somewhere. I go swimming and I\\u2019m in the water with a bunch of people. I think Josh is in the water with me. I think we grow tails and are like mermaids from Harry Potter because we\\u2019re under the water. That shifts and I\\u2019m back out of the water. I go to find the chair I was sitting in with the baby. I can\\u2019t find the chair but I find another chair covered in blankets. I take the blankets off. There\\u2019s a dog leash attached to this chair and there\\u2019s a tiny, tiny baby, maybe a couple days old. The baby is about as long as my forearm. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh, whose baby is this?\\u201d I look up and turn around and the dad is right there. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s my baby, we\\u2019re watching it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh okay, good, somebody is watching this baby.\\u201d The Waldorf presentation continues and now there\\u2019s a projector playing some sort of music out onto a screen. I don\\u2019t know where this screen came from. We\\u2019re all still out on this gigantic field. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a wall of a building or a screen suspended from the sky. Josh has been around this whole time but he\\u2019s not actually with me. It feels kind of strange because there\\u2019s a little bit of space and estrangement between us. The projector is between Josh and I. Josh and his friends are leaning on a counter watching the screen. One of the Waldorf teachers turns to me and is like, \\u201cCan you go back in the back room?\\u201d The room is off to my left and off to Josh\\u2019s right because we\\u2019re facing each other across the space. In this room are a bunch of other adults and a guy with a video camera in his hands. He\\u2019s filming. The Waldorf teacher is like, \\u201cCan you go over there and tell that guy to stop filming or at least move because he\\u2019s showing up in the film that the projector is putting out onto the screen.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what is being projected - the images aren\\u2019t sticking in my memory. I go to move him but then I start showing up on the projector screen. The teachers are yelling at both of us. I don\\u2019t know how this is happening because the projector is over to our right and in front of us, he\\u2019s got a video camera in his hand and I\\u2019m behind him trying to tell him to scooch over a little bit. I don\\u2019t know how we\\u2019re ending up on the screen. I\\u2019m telling one of the Waldorf teachers, \\u201cI can\\u2019t help you. I don\\u2019t know what you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m telling them that they need to come and adjust whatever they want to adjust. I go back to where I was sitting. Josh comes over and is like, \\u201cI know you\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way but you\\u2019re really in the way.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cJesus, not winning here.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of women but I don\\u2019t know any of them at all. They\\u2019re younger, in their twenties and early thirties. We\\u2019re together on a boat, I think. There\\u2019s water everywhere. It\\u2019s clearly a group of witches. Most of them are just beginning to learn spellwork. I\\u2019m the only one there who knows how to do it. There are rituals happening or perhaps initiation. One of the younger women is guiding us through the process. I don\\u2019t know that I\\u2019ve actually received training and I already know how to do all of it and I\\u2019m just going along and it\\u2019s perfectly fine for me to be doing that. I don\\u2019t have any need to let them all know that I already know how to do all of it. I\\u2019m just there with them, watching and observing. Each woman is taking turns and we\\u2019re creating a circle. The woman who is leading all this is standing in the center and each woman being initiated is walking in a circle around the other woman and the rest of us are watching. I\\u2019m part of the crowd watching the younger woman in the center. As each woman goes and does her initiation and shows what spells she knows, she\\u2019s walking around the other woman in a circle. The thing is, we\\u2019re all walking on water. The boat or whatever we were on is around somewhere, but we\\u2019re off of the boat and each of us is either standing on water or walking on water. You can see the shore from where we are and it\\u2019s a rocky shore. Then it\\u2019s my turn to go and walk on water in the circle. There\\u2019s a dress I put on. This dress is a purple taffeta, shiny and stiff. The purple is a deep black purple and it shimmers with black. It\\u2019s very Victorain era looking with tons of folds and gathers and ruffles, but it\\u2019s not super girly, it\\u2019s quite elegant. I put this dress on and start walking the circle on the water. As I start to walk, my power starts to rise. I\\u2019m no longer hiding that I have power and know how to use it. The water starts to churn and with the other women the water was not churning. As I walk, the water starts to churn around and around. This is where I recognize that the dress I\\u2019m wearing is actually a dress of Helen\\u2019s, it\\u2019s a priestess dress imbued with power and I\\u2019m wearing it. The woman in the center who was leading us the whole time is a little startled because this hasn\\u2019t happened with the other women she was initiating. I have a little smile on my face because I know I\\u2019m invoking something that\\u2019s a little bit older than what any of them have ever seen and that I\\u2019m calling on the water elemental and the air elemental as the wind starts to blow. I can hear that Helen has shown up or her presence has shown up. She\\u2019s whispering in the ear of the woman in the center and the woman in the center is in awe. She thinks Helen is a guide from somewhere and she\\u2019s quite in awe. I know who it is and I can hear what she has to say and it\\u2019s all wise teachings, but the awe is not there for me because I know who it is. The woman in the center passes on as Helen speaks it as prophecy. I sort of grin and let her speak as I continue walking my circle and creating this water vortex that is spinning. Then my turn is over and it\\u2019s time for some of the other girls to go. This vortex I created with the water and wind stays and adds itself to the ceremony ritual happening. The woman in the center keeps babbling on about how wise and mystical this guide is. I say, \\u201cYes, she\\u2019s quite wise and ancient and she\\u2019s very powerful,\\u201d knowing it was Helen speaking but what was channeling through her were the powers of Avalon that are very ancient and old. But I don\\u2019t tell any of the other participants what it is because it seems it\\u2019s over their head and this is a good first mystical experience for them. The dream ends with us dispersing. We leave the water and the boat but I don\\u2019t know where we all go.\"],[\"There are three or four black women, I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re actresses. They\\u2019re going on stage. One is stunningly beautiful and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who needs to be on stage.\\u201d I keep wanting to build her up and make sure she knows how beautiful she is. For some reason she\\u2019s not seeing how beautiful she is. I\\u2019m trying to convince her through showing her.Then I have berries which look like blueberries. I\\u2019ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don\\u2019t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I\\u2019m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don\\u2019t know who. I\\u2019m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I\\u2019m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it\\u2019s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard. I can see this cartoonish looking town through the branches and it\\u2019s dark and there are lights on. The roads are very hilly and windy.\"],[\"I am talking to a detective who I\\u2019m hiring to go watch my ex-father-in-law and my dad who are supposed to be taking turns watching my son who is an infant. They\\u2019re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don\\u2019t work. The reason I\\u2019m hiring this detective is because I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re watching my son very well and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s entirely safe. They\\u2019re watching him for me because I\\u2019m working and I don\\u2019t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They\\u2019re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It\\u2019s odd that they\\u2019re together because they don\\u2019t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they\\u2019re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who\\u2019s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they\\u2019re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I\\u2019m observing this whole thing. I\\u2019m on the pool deck somewhere but they don\\u2019t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They\\u2019re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you\\u2019re both talking shit about me and the fact that I\\u2019m not around to watch my son and it\\u2019s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I\\u2019m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can\\u2019t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law\\u2019s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn\\u2019t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.\\u201d My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There\\u2019s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I\\u2019m having them watch my son in the first place. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson\\u2019s mom to him. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I\\u2019m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, \\u201cPick a spot.\\u201d All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that\\u2019s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don\\u2019t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it\\u2019s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they\\u2019re taking the exam. I don\\u2019t have my books. In fact I didn\\u2019t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I\\u2019m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don\\u2019t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I\\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don\\u2019t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn\\u2019t miss too much and I could just get someone else\\u2019s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.\"],[\"I was at a beach with a couple of friends and the only one I recognize is my friend, who is a lifestyle dom and I\\u2019ve really had a good time observing her and working with her and getting to know about being a dom from her. In the dream we are at the ocean. We\\u2019re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it\\u2019s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I\\u2019m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She\\u2019s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We\\u2019re on a culdesac. It\\u2019s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I\\u2019m not sure whose. I\\u2019m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it\\u2019s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I\\u2019m not sure. There are adults and kids. I\\u2019m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I\\u2019m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I\\u2019m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cCould you hurry up? You\\u2019re taking a long time and why do you need that?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBecause I like it.\\u201d Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn\\u2019t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don\\u2019t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there\\u2019s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn\\u2019t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, \\u201cWhy am I taking off this thing that I like?\\u201d I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn\\u2019t like it and was all judgmental about it. The dream ends there with that going through my head.\"],[\"A journey to a house. I\\u2019m coming to a house from somewhere else. This house is huge and it\\u2019s quite grand, almost like a mansion but not quite as big. It\\u2019s very spacious and there is a lot of open space. The house is a house that someone is letting me and other people stay in. i\\u2019m the original person that the house owner let stay and I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m paying a really reduced rent or what. I\\u2019m the person whose name is on the lease or rental agreement. I have a bunch of other people living there with me because it\\u2019s a huge house. I\\u2019ve been on vacation somewhere and have just come back to the house. Josh is with me. He\\u2019s dragging his feet and is not excited about being back in this house. He keeps complaining about it not feeling like home and being too big. He\\u2019s also the only male in the house. The other people I\\u2019ve let the house out to are all women. When we walk in the door, there\\u2019s a bunch of women, all blonde and middle aged, very nice. They\\u2019re doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen area with the concrete countertops. It\\u2019s very open with windows that look out. I realize I have some things to clean up and am looking through drawers trying to find towels to mop up the mess. Then my friend, Nani from high school who I haven\\u2019t seen since she left high school her Junior year to move to California. She\\u2019s wandering around and is not talking a lot, she doesn\\u2019t have a whole lot to say. I go and follow her to the space she\\u2019s occupying. She\\u2019s taken up the den or the parlor. She\\u2019s put a bed in it and it\\u2019s super cute, I love the way she decorated it. It\\u2019s open to the rest of the house but you do have to go around a corner set of stairs to get to it. I\\u2019m wondering how she feels about not having a lot of privacy. I say hi to her and go back into the kitchen. Josh is there moping and sitting on the steps. The stairs are kind of crazy, a really big set of stairs with no railing on one side. You go up the stairs and hit a landing then turn and go up a second set of stairs. The second set of stairs is between two walls so there are rooms on either side at that point. The first part has no railing at all. We go up and our bedroom is up there. He\\u2019s sitting on the stairs and I think he comes up the stairs with me. I\\u2019m noticing as I go up into what would be our bedroom how empty it feels and it doesn\\u2019t actually feel like home. There are other bedrooms where other people are staying as well. The house is so big and it seems like it keeps getting bigger or there are more doors. I come back down the stairs and walk back through the kitchen and dining room area. The dining room has a big dining table and a big chandelier over the top. Off the dining room is another hallway and there are more rooms back there. We walk back there. This is where the two blonde ladies are saying, they have a space back here. It\\u2019s pretty comfortable. I\\u2019m looking and I realize the panel has a door and I suddenly see it. Josh is still moping somewhere and he\\u2019s on his phone and complaining about how he wants to go home or he wants to go where people know him. All I can think is we have this great place and there\\u2019s an adventure to be had because I just realized there\\u2019s a doorway into something else and he\\u2019s not ready. The words that keep coming through my head are, \\u201cYou\\u2019re just really immature and moping like a little boy so why don\\u2019t you do that because clearly you need to do that. I\\u2019m going in through this door to see what\\u2019s there.\\u201d I open up the door. Initially I just poke my head in to see what it is. I can see round hobbit doors and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is a portal into another realm, I can totally tell.\\u201d I look over my shoulder and see Josh being mopey and sad. I leave him and go in. it\\u2019s this hallway with all these doors off it and also a common area which is basically under where the stairs would be. The wood grain seems a bit shimmery and mirage-like. I walk in and run into all these women, but they\\u2019re not human. They\\u2019re all different kinds of fae. They\\u2019re talking to me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHi, I didn\\u2019t know this was here. Where is this? What is this? How are you staying at this house?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh we just rent with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d They\\u2019re super happy to show me the place. There\\u2019s nor weirdness about me as a human being there. One of them has bronze skin and curly hair, one of them has a baby. The one with a baby is the one who talks with me the most. She keeps dropping her baby. She sets him down and he sits for a little bit but then his head gets heavy and he flops over backwards. He nails his head on the floor which is concrete but he doesn\\u2019t cry. She just picks him up and sets him up again in another precarious position. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you want to put him there, he\\u2019s going to flop over again.\\u201d Sure enough he falls again and smacks his head really hard and fusses a little bit, but she calms him. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s good for him but she doesn\\u2019t seem concerned so I just leave it be. She\\u2019s the one who explains to me who they all are. She keeps calling herself and the other people/fae the name but I can\\u2019t pronounce it so I just forget. Then I start asking her, \\u201cWhat are you all doing here?\\u201d When I had walked from the dining into that back room the house started to feel weird and I told her, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s an entity in this house and I need to smudge and clear it out.\\u201d Now that I\\u2019m talking to this woman beneath the stairs in fae land or wherever I am, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yeah, we\\u2019re here because we keep that thing at bay. But you guys feel it more in that part of the house.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh well, how do I get rid of it? It doesn\\u2019t need to stay here and I know I can get rid of it. Whatever the dark pall that is hanging over the house just needs to go.\\u201d I think Josh is depressed and that\\u2019s part of why he\\u2019s depressed. She says, \\u201cOh well, you can clean it out, but we mostly do the work of keeping it out in here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay awesome. I\\u2019m still going to try and get rid of it because it\\u2019s not necessary and it doesn\\u2019t feel good and it makes the rest of the house feel really yucky and uncomfortable to be in.\\u201d Then the dream ends here because I don\\u2019t remember coming out of that part of the house, I think I just woke up. I have the sense that everything is okay and this part of the house is where I want to be and I don\\u2019t know if I want to return to the other side.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a friend from the pole studio and we\\u2019re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it\\u2019s not even a possibility for me. We\\u2019re both running around looking for a pole to buy that\\u2019s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It\\u2019s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there\\u2019s no place to workout. We\\u2019re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it\\u2019s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can\\u2019t find what we\\u2019re looking for. I dream some more but don\\u2019t remember what it was. Suddenly I\\u2019m with a Native American man. He\\u2019s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I\\u2019m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don\\u2019t recognize anybody I\\u2019m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they\\u2019ve bonded somehow. I\\u2019m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We\\u2019re in the forest somewhere. He\\u2019s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, \\u201cYou have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why that\\u2019s important but that\\u2019s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I\\u2019m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we\\u2019re protesting capitalism, basically. We\\u2019re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We\\u2019re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that\\u2019s happening with these young kids and how they\\u2019re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh are we going to go in and stop them?\\u201d but the man is like, \\u201cNope, we\\u2019re just going to listen and we\\u2019re going to make food.\\u201d We\\u2019re making food to bring. There\\u2019s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it\\u2019s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I\\u2019m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We\\u2019re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that\\u2019s different from what\\u2019s being taught and told about at this parade. We\\u2019re doing a silent protest. I\\u2019m freaking out because it\\u2019s children that they\\u2019re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can\\u2019t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It\\u2019s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that\\u2019s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we\\u2019re seeing or if we\\u2019re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there\\u2019s this younger dad who\\u2019s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that\\u2019s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, \\u201cYou have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn\\u2019t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, \\u201cOh, I have magic powers? I\\u2019m going to show you my magic powers.\\u201d All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don\\u2019t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it\\u2019s hurting my people and other people. He\\u2019s just so enraged, he\\u2019s lost it. He doesn\\u2019t care who he hurts. I\\u2019m horrified because I\\u2019m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can\\u2019t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won\\u2019t stop. I finally go, \\u201cOkay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What\\u2019s really going on?\\u201d He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won\\u2019t talk to him and he hasn\\u2019t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she\\u2019s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it\\u2019s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, \\u201cAre you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?\\u201d He\\u2019s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they\\u2019re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he\\u2019s so hurt and wounded. We\\u2019re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we\\u2019re conversing we\\u2019re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He\\u2019s an older man, he\\u2019s bald and he\\u2019s wearing all black. He says to me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.\\u201d For whatever reason I see him and am like, \\u201cOh my god, oh no.\\u201d I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I\\u2019m in a towel, I don\\u2019t have my clothes on and don\\u2019t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I\\u2019m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It\\u2019s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn\\u2019t warn them and don\\u2019t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I\\u2019m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don\\u2019t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn\\u2019t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that\\u2019s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren\\u2019t even ground up. I\\u2019m eating in a safe place where this man can\\u2019t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.\\u201d I need to get clothes but I\\u2019m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don\\u2019t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m pretty incoherent. I haven\\u2019t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they\\u2019re part of the oppressor group.\"],[\"I am with one high school classmate, Janet, and some others - somebody\\u2019s parents and some other friends. We\\u2019re going to a park where we can camp and there\\u2019s also a house and cabins you can rent. We\\u2019re celebrating something. It\\u2019s very chill. There\\u2019s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there\\u2019s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you\\u2019d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you\\u2019d dive right onto the slide. It\\u2019s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it\\u2019s like a forest. There\\u2019s also an open area. We\\u2019re there celebrating and I\\u2019m actually starting to get concerned because I\\u2019m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it\\u2019s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, \\u201cUh, coronavirus is up and we\\u2019re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.\\u201d When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I\\u2019m wading into the water. I\\u2019m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it\\u2019s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it\\u2019s a shiny burnt orange color. I don\\u2019t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I\\u2019m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I\\u2019m getting uncomfortable because I\\u2019m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there\\u2019s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It\\u2019s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it\\u2019s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out. The water is pretty warm but when I come out, it\\u2019s cold, like about to start snowing cold. I bundle myself up and head back to the house that we rented. Now there are way more people in it. I\\u2019m crawling into a bed because I\\u2019m freezing. I\\u2019m first there by myself, but then all these other people show up and they crawl into the bed with me. The other people are older, like aunties and uncles and even grandmas. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope.\\u201d The sun has gone down. I change clothes so I\\u2019m warm and I go out of the house. There\\u2019s this guy, I don\\u2019t know him, maybe in his thirties with short dark hair. I noticed him by the pond earlier because he was there doing some work and he had this bronze statue of himself that was animated. He had made a copy of himself that was helping him with a project down there. When I come out of the house, he\\u2019s by the house with his bronze copy of himself. But the copy is misbehaving, it won\\u2019t do what he tells it to do. He\\u2019s trying to kill it and chop off its head in pieces. I\\u2019m a little freaked out by the whole thing because I get this eerie feeling that if he doesn\\u2019t do something about that copy of himself it\\u2019s going to wreak havoc on everybody and just start killing everyone. At some point, he manages to get control of it and chops it into pieces and puts it on a tarp and wraps the tarp up. I\\u2019m kind of grossed out by the whole thing. I don\\u2019t know what he does with the tarp. He\\u2019s definitely a musician because i see him go from there to setting up a ritual space. He brings all the elements in. He has rings on his fingers. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing and what he\\u2019s setting up. The dream shifts. I end up traveling somewhere else. I\\u2019m traveling with Josh. he\\u2019s feeling super beat down and his self esteem is in the toilet. He\\u2019s picking at acne on his body so badly that it\\u2019s leaving holes in his skin. He\\u2019s super fucking depressed. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re traveling to or from. I don\\u2019t even know what kind of vehicle we\\u2019re in but there are seats. I\\u2019m in a seat and he\\u2019s in a seat next to me. There\\u2019s seaglass, round and smooth, and some are pretty big like the size of the palm of my hand. They\\u2019re all different colors, red and purple and greens and blues. There are smaller pieces, too. It\\u2019s gorgeous and it\\u2019s his personal collection. I\\u2019m trying to hang onto this glass while we\\u2019re in this vehicle. At some point we\\u2019re flying because I look out the window and see clouds below us, but we\\u2019re also driving. I put the glass down and all of a sudden the vehicle accelerates and the glass falls off the shelf I put it on and shatters into so many tiny pieces on the metal of the floor of this vehicle. Josh is ambivalent about it and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, all of your glass!\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified because I put it there and it broke, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really care.\\u201d I\\u2019m super upset about it breaking and I feel bad. I\\u2019m also upset that he doesn\\u2019t care. I sweep up all the little shards and we put them in the trash. There are a few tiny pieces left and I gather those up and hang onto them. We get to where we\\u2019re going and we get out of this vehicle. We end up at a weird saloon bar place. It\\u2019s dark. We meet these two women who I think were our travel companions at one point. I don\\u2019t know who they are but they\\u2019re familiar to me in the dream. One of the women has a blond braid and the other has longer dark hair. They sit down at a table and ask the bartender for this type of alcohol that you usually need one shot of and you\\u2019re good. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take the whole bottle.\\u201d The bartender is like, \\u201cNo you won\\u2019t.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, we will.\\u201d Josh is like, \\u201cYeah, let them have it. I\\u2019ll take care of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo! They\\u2019re going to be obnoxious and terrible.\\u201d But by the time I look back, the two women have finished the bottle and the bartender is standing there with shoulders shrugged. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no.\\u201d Of course they get crazy. Josh starts feeding off of them energetically because he doesn\\u2019t drink at all. I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cUh oh, this is not going to be good, you\\u2019re going from depressed to manic.\\u201d They\\u2019re playing on a piano. It is like a saloon. There\\u2019s nobody else in there. The bartender is like, \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re closing.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re closing? You just got these two ladies wasted and there\\u2019s no place for us to go. We\\u2019re staying here.\\u201d The dream shifts. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I\\u2019m at, maybe a Costco type area. There\\u2019s a guy, older man maybe in his fifties, pot-bellied white dude with short hair. He\\u2019s used his body his whole life to work, you can tell, his hands are super callused. He\\u2019s hungry and he\\u2019s trying to figure out what to eat that is healthy. I\\u2019m standing looking at everything in the freezer section and am like, \\u201cOkay, if you eat this, this and this, it doesn\\u2019t have any dairy.\\u201d I was trying to find food that met the restrictions he had. I say, \\u201cThis pizza has a cauliflower crust and it\\u2019s non-dairy with fake cheese. It comes with these other items in the box, so you can buy the whole thing and that\\u2019s your meal.\\u201d There\\u2019s a microwave conveniently nearby. He heats it up and eats while we\\u2019re standing in the freezer section. He puts the tray down on his shopping cart, eats and enjoys it. The whole time he\\u2019s complaining about how expensive it is for him to eat this way even though he needs to because it\\u2019s becoming life or death. He needs to start eating in a more healthy way. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cYou can complain about the money it costs to buy this food or you can complain about the money it costs for all the healthcare you\\u2019re going to need. There are ways to cut down because you can buy food at the beginning of the week and meal prep and that saves money. You have containers in the fridge you can eat.\\u201d I\\u2019m going through all this stuff I know from my nutrition degree to help him out and simplify things for him. But I don\\u2019t know who he is and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this for him. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m getting paid for it or not. It seems like a lot of energy being put into this person who keeps saying over and over again, \\u201cThis is really expensive.\\u201d Eventually I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDo you feel better?\\u201d He says yes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s your choice. You can keep eating shit and keep feeling like shit or you can figure out how to do this. He doesn\\u2019t give me a response and I just wake up.\"],[\"This was kind of a weird dream. I\\u2019m looking for a house to buy. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m with my ex and the kids or some other family. I just know I\\u2019m with other people and we\\u2019re all looking at houses together. There\\u2019s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you\\u2019d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They\\u2019re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu\\u2019u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I\\u2019m looking and we decide not to buy it because it\\u2019s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I\\u2019m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They\\u2019ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren\\u2019t white anymore. They\\u2019ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m not comfortable with them. I\\u2019m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I\\u2019m not sure who it is; it\\u2019s a female person and we\\u2019re not really friends. It\\u2019s kind of like I\\u2019m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it\\u2019s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We\\u2019re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I\\u2019m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn\\u2019t feel a connection either, so she\\u2019s just gone. As I leave, I\\u2019m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I\\u2019m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn\\u2019t really resonance there anyway. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it\\u2019s just not for me.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Aila and her two kids. I\\u2019m not sure if my kids are around. We\\u2019re in her house and her house is gigantic because she hosts people in it. She hosts retreats in this house. The house has huge rooms and huge levels. Each level has its own set of dishes. We\\u2019re looking at all the dishes and cleaning them. One room was used and there\\u2019s a ton of dishes in the sink that need to be cleaned and put away. In another room I\\u2019m putting away props or items that had been used. There is a retreat going on, but maybe it\\u2019s not really a retreat because they seem to be friends of hers. I recognize all of them because I know a lot of her friends. They\\u2019re just here to hang out. One of the friends is setting up a tent in the yard under a bunch of trees with her daughter. Aila calls her over. Everyone starts talking for a little bit, but I don\\u2019t remember any particular conversation or how long that interaction lasted. There was a busyness with a lot of friends unpacking or doing other things. I\\u2019m in one of the rooms now with Aila and her kids. We\\u2019re cleaning up dishes. I also have this plant in my hand. I\\u2019m not sure where I got it. It has orange grasses but it doesn\\u2019t have a pot, so I'm trying to find a pot for it. One of the kiddos is cleaning this interesting bowl like a big gravy boat. All the dishes in the house are the exact same, just different shades of blue, turquoise, teal. One of the kids is cleaning this one that looks kind of like a round gravy boat. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019ll take that, it\\u2019s perfect for this plant.\\u201d I put the plant in it. Somehow I get this other plant that kind of looks like a lei. I put it over the other plant in the dish and it\\u2019s actually really pretty with the orange underneath and the one that looks like a lei with flowers. I don\\u2019t recognize the flowers and in fact, neither of these plants are like ones that I\\u2019ve seen ever in my whole existence alive on earth. Aila comes and looks. I think it upsets her because I'm smooshing the plant underneath. But I\\u2019m not sure if she\\u2019s upset but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cMaybe let\\u2019s move that to another place.\\u201d She\\u2019s very diplomatic in the way she says it. There\\u2019s more but I can\\u2019t recall.\"],[\"The feelings in these dreams were kind of strange. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what I was doing in any of them. I\\u2019m standing on a bridge with some other people. This bridge was at least two-hundred feet up from the water, really high up. It was a paved road so cards could go over it. There\\u2019s a huge gathering of people, so many, and I\\u2019m seeing them in the water. I have to look through a pair of binoculars to see them because they\\u2019re that far away. I\\u2019m trying to take a picture and am zooming in a lot to try and see everyone. Some of the people are waiting for me to jump in. I'm like, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re crazy, that\\u2019s way too much of a distance, that will kill me.\\u201d I do not know what happens after I try to take the picture, but I\\u2019m struggling to take it and refusing to jump in the water. Then dream happens. Then there\\u2019s another scene. I\\u2019m in a house that\\u2019s quite cute, like a studio house. The bedroom, living room, kitchen are all one area. It\\u2019s in Portland area. I think it's late summer because there are green leaves on the trees and they are just starting to turn and it\\u2019s warm. I\\u2019m standing in that house. The cabinets in the kitchen are painted white and it\\u2019s very bright and cheery, very airy, too. I don\\u2019t know who I\\u2019m with, they\\u2019re my partner though. I go out onto the porch and there\\u2019s a bunch of kids sitting on the porch. The kids have helmets on, like they\\u2019ve been riding their bikes or skateboards. I\\u2019m showing them how to do something, but I don\\u2019t know what it is. They\\u2019re playing video games and maybe they\\u2019re showing me how to play or I\\u2019m showing them. I don\\u2019t know why we\\u2019re playing video games because it\\u2019s a gorgeous day and I want for us to just be out.\"],[\"I am with Josh, my partner. I\\u2019m standing in the kitchen next to the sink. There\\u2019s a concrete floor. I\\u2019ve made a salad for both of us. Things are a little strained between us. I ask him if he wants to dress the salad. He goes to get the olive oil and he spills it everywhere on the floor. I\\u2019m extremely annoyed and upset about this. My reaction does not make sense for the mistake he made. He can see I\\u2019m made. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cClean it up.\\u201d He goes outside to get a hose. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is he doing? Get a rag to clean this up.\\u201d Somehow the oil is spreading. I watch him go outside. I can see a fig tree through the window. The window is the kind we have in Hawaii with the old panes of glass. There are all these huge gorgeous yummy figs on the tree and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I want to go pick those figs.\\u201d He\\u2019s out there getting the hose but he\\u2019s fucking around. Meanwhile the oil keeps spreading more and more. I don\\u2019t want to go out because I\\u2019d step in the oil and spread it some more. I can see there are chickens out there and the chickens keep trying to eat the figs. I yell at him through the window: \\u201cPick the figs!\\u201d He goes to pick them but he doesn\\u2019t have a basket to put them in. The chickens keep going after him. He\\u2019s still messing with the hose. Then he turns into my dad. He\\u2019s a bumbling idiot out there and I\\u2019m super frustrated with the whole thing. I leave the kitchen and all of a sudden I\\u2019m in a grocery store co-op. There are a ton of plants. Josh, who has turned into my dad, has the hose now and is trying to come into the house with it to clean up the oil and water the plants. I\\u2019m watching him walk through the kitchen into this back room that\\u2019s a co-op. In this backroom are tons of starts. He goes to water them, but he has the hose on super high pressure and he\\u2019s obliterating all the seedlings. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing? Where\\u2019s your common sense?\\u201d I\\u2019m so irate. At this point I just ignore him and the whole thing. I go into my room, but I don\\u2019t want it to be my room because it\\u2019s a smaller room. My sister is there but it\\u2019s not actually my sister, it\\u2019s another little girl who is my sister in this dream. She\\u2019s talking non-stop and I just want some space. I\\u2019m especially annoyed because she has the bigger bedroom and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do I have this little one?\\u201d She has this little piece of paper with a calendar on it. The calendar has been pulled out of a magazine and the magazine is the flyer or coupon book for the co-op. I don\\u2019t even know if the dates are right on the calendar, I think it\\u2019s last year. She\\u2019s pinned the calendar on the wall for me and I think that\\u2019s useful. But then I look at the dates and see that it\\u2019s not useful. She\\u2019s pinned it over the one window in my bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy have you pinned it over the window?\\u201d I go to pull it off and it has just regular blinds over the window. She goes, \\u201cBecause it stares into my room.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d Sure enough, I go and look and all I can see is her bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh yeah, let\\u2019s put curtains over that.\\u201d She goes to put a curtain over it and the curtain is the same color as the walls. The walls are a very light bright bluish green. I\\u2019m hating all of it. I don\\u2019t like this wall color, I don\\u2019t like this curtain and the curtain doesn\\u2019t , I don\\u2019t like the size of this room and I don\\u2019t like that she\\u2019s in here. This is not what I would choose for my space at all. Why the hell am I here? My mom comes in and is trying to smooth things over. I go outside. She follows me outside. We go outside because there is a gorgeous sunset happening and I want to catch the sunset. But I didn\\u2019t bring my phone or camera. I tell my little sister to grab my phone. I\\u2019m in my twenties or thirties and she\\u2019s six or seven. She takes her fucking time but by the time she comes back the sunset is gone. It was a beautiful glorious sunset. I try to pick a few of the figs for myself. Now I look up and in the night sky and I can see the Earth and Jupiter and Saturn making this cluster in the sky. I start taking pictures. I can see the continents, clouds and oceans of the Earth from where I\\u2019m standing, which I thought was earth, but apparently it\\u2019s not. Then to see Saturn and Jupiter, I think, \\u201cWell of course I can see them close together, it was the Great Conjunction.\\u201d All of a sudden Earth becomes a meteor and Jupiter and Saturn go with it. They start to burn up like when a meteor goes through Earth\\u2019s atmosphere. I\\u2019m panicking. I\\u2019m in the yard with the kids. I\\u2019m looking down and can see buildings like in a city. These two kids are Indian from India. They start to laugh as the Earth travels through the atmosphere and starts burning up. I\\u2019m horrified but they\\u2019re laughing like it\\u2019s the greatest prank in the world. Then I realize that it\\u2019s a ball and they somehow managed with magic to make it look like Earth and Jupiter and Saturn. It is going to burn up as it comes through the atmosphere and it will land and make an explosion, but it\\u2019s a ball because it stays the same size. They\\u2019re laughing hysterically because they\\u2019ve just pulled off this prank. I\\u2019m horrified because this entire dream I\\u2019ve just had this sense of where am I, why am I here, what am I doing...I\\u2019m trying to find bits of beauty, but I miss the sunset. I do see Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, but they seem to be fake. I go back into the co-op and the manager of the co-op is there now. The co-op is filled out now. I see grocery store shelves stocked with fruits and vegetables, and aisles with alternative flowers. The co-op manager is trying to hire people. He gets on the PA to talk about the benefits of working at the co-op. He says something like, \\u201cYou have at least one weekend day off.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo way! I would never work there.\\u201d I\\u2019m kind of laughing because he\\u2019s awkward on the PA system. But it does sound terrible the way he described it. The dream ends with me looking at him with a puzzled look on my face. My mom, dad and sister have all disappeared from the dream. There\\u2019s one other co-op employee hanging around and rolling his eyes as he hears the manager talk.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There\\u2019s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She\\u2019s cooking. I\\u2019m trying to load the dishwasher. It\\u2019s a very complicated dishwasher and I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in. She\\u2019s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There\\u2019s enough though. I\\u2019m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever\\u2019s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, \\u201cCan you please open this?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy? I don\\u2019t drink.\\u201d Even though it\\u2019s beer, it\\u2019s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are you all drinking?\\u201d We\\u2019re at a gathering, maybe it\\u2019s Christmas or New Year\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t know, but there\\u2019s a celebration happening. Of course, it\\u2019s my family, so they\\u2019re all drinking and I\\u2019m the only one that doesn\\u2019t drink. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy am I opening this bottle for her?\\u201d I think she\\u2019s trying to give it to me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, here\\u2019s your bottle of beer-wine.\\u201d I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I\\u2019m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird\\u2019s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn\\u2019t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s not my childhood home or even my home. I think it\\u2019s my mom\\u2019s home. I\\u2019m there to see her. I think I\\u2019m my current age. I\\u2019m sitting in the corner of the kitchen where the cabinets come together. I\\u2019m sitting on the floor. She\\u2019s yelling at me. My little brothers are there. They\\u2019re little again. My brother that was born right after me is also there, but he looks like he\\u2019s maybe just out of his teenage years. So maybe I\\u2019m in my early twenties. She\\u2019s yelling at me and my two youngest brothers. My other brother and I are going to take the kids on a trip. We\\u2019re going to the grocery store. We go to the grocery store in his white Tacoma truck (he doesn\\u2019t have one in real life). My brothers are in the car with us. We go to the grocery store and get all of our supplies. Then we go to check out and my brother decides the lines are too long for him and he\\u2019s pissed off. So he decides to take the cart full of groceries and somehow get them in the truck that\\u2019s now in the store. He drives the truck through these two doors. The regular sliding doors are not an option because there are a ton of people in there and a rent-a-cop. There are these two doors on the side which I don\\u2019t think a truck can fit through, but he drives through them anyways. The truck barely makes it through. He heads out into the parking lot which is full of people. I\\u2019m pissed at him like, \\u201cYou just fucking stole groceries! And you almost run over people. We need to go back.\\u201d He circles around the huge parking lot. He\\u2019s trying to park but we\\u2019re on a side of the building with an entire school\\u2019s worth of parents and kids. The kids are running around. This is where he decides to park. I\\u2019m getting more and more pissed because at any moment the cops are going to come and arrest us for stealing groceries even though I didn\\u2019t steal them. I\\u2019m also afraid he\\u2019s going to hit some of the kids running around this parking lot. The kids are kindergarten up through fifth or eighth grade. He parks in one stall that\\u2019s totally open with no one nearby. But then he decides he doesn\\u2019t like it, pulls out of it, and goes to find another spot to park. This stall is in between a minivan and SUV that have parked next to each other, but they haven\\u2019t parked straight, so the stall in between is not large enough for the truck. They parked so that no one could park near them because their kids are running around. But he picks that stall to park in. i\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?! You\\u2019re acting entitled. You\\u2019re not paying attention to other people and your surroundings. We need to pay for these groceries.\\u201d I finally get the groceries out of the truck and there are so many that I have to get two carts, so I put them head to head, which is kind of strange. He pushes them in, but he\\u2019s trying to go in the out doors. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to go over to the side where it says, In.\\u201d Because he was trying to go In the Out, there\\u2019s chaos with the amount of people at the checkout. We can\\u2019t actually make it in so we have to go in these other doors. We have to go around to get to the cash registers and pay. We\\u2019re on our way around and I\\u2019m pushing the cart. Somehow this guy with a baby on his back and holding the hand of a toddler, I manage to trip him. Really what happens is he wasn\\u2019t paying attention as I was trying to squeeze behind him. He turns and he trips. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh, are you okay?\\u201d He gets really upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. I should have made more noise so you could hear that I was behind you. Are you okay? Is the baby okay?\\u201d He stands up and starts to yell at me and my brother because in our hurry, we don\\u2019t have our masks on. This guy also doesn\\u2019t have his mask on because he\\u2019s pulled it down around his neck. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to have to cite you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope, hang on, don\\u2019t worry. I have my mask right here.\\u201d I pull my mask out to put it on and my brother pulls his mask out to put it on. I\\u2019m thinking this guy is going to be more upset about tripping and falling, but he\\u2019s more upset about the masks.\"],[\"It\\u2019s me and another woman who\\u2019s older than me, a white lady who I don\\u2019t know. I actually don\\u2019t know anyone in this dream. We both have an idea for a program we want to put together for others, and they\\u2019re slightly different. We\\u2019re supporting each other in getting it out into the world. Suddenly when we\\u2019re in a restaurant or gathering hall. There\\u2019s a guy who\\u2019s an MC and also really schmoozy and slimy. There are suddenly a lot of other people in this hall. There are tables where food is being served. The food is being catered. Me and this woman are sitting on a couch off to the side, in a lounge area. The guy is on the stage and he\\u2019s pitching our ideas to the audience. He\\u2019s trying to pitch each project separately for people to invest in them. All of sudden he starts having the people compete and choose one project or the other. He\\u2019s leaning a lot towards the older woman and her program, I think because there are enough similarities in our programs that he decides there should just be one. I\\u2019m sitting in the lounge on the couch and I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s fine. Don\\u2019t worry about it. You do your program and I\\u2019ll figure out something else to do. I actually don\\u2019t want any part of this because it feels gross. You go ahead and do your thing.\\u201d His presentation ends and the dinner ends. The people leave. I go from being someone who\\u2019s having an idea pitched to the help. I am now cleaning and clearing the tables. The bartender is still there and there are a couple others of us trying to clean and clear the tables. The bartender is like, \\u201cHey, leave the silverware but take any extra food.\\u201d There are these lettuce-wrapped sandwiches and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cTake any of those that are extra and put them in my fridge.\\u201d I keep picking them up in my bare hands. They aren\\u2019t even on a plate. They\\u2019re lettuce with turkey, tomato, cheese and mayonnaise on the inside. They\\u2019re sliding all over the place because they\\u2019re warm at this point. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYup, come put them in my little bar fridge.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little bar fridge and it\\u2019s overflowing and I keep dropping the sandwiches and they\\u2019re opening up and making a mess. He\\u2019s kind of starting to bitch at me. I\\u2019m kind of confused because it seems very unsanitary, but he wants to use them for the next dinner I guess. I don\\u2019t know what to do except keep grabbing the sandwiches and giving them to him. He\\u2019s so rude and abrasive and controlling that I\\u2019m also a little bit afraid of him.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a school and there\\u2019s a parent teacher conference. I think it\\u2019s a Waldorf School because kids are running around and it seems kind of loosey-goosey. There\\u2019s a kids counselor and their teacher. They're interviewing my ex and I. I get the sense that they\\u2019re trying to see who\\u2019s a more fit parent and who\\u2019s safer for the kids to be around. My ex goes first and they\\u2019re asking him all kinds of questions. One of the teachers is this older white man, he has this grandfatherly elder feel to him. One of the other teachers of interviewers is a woman, maybe in her late thirties or early forties. She has dark brown hair. My ex goes first and they\\u2019re asking him all kinds of questions. In the dream the conversation is very clear but I\\u2019ve forgotten now. His responses have this feel that he\\u2019s just trying to get at me and poke at me. He\\u2019s not being kind or fair and is straight up telling lies about my parenting. Then it\\u2019s my turn and I get in a couple of comments that insinuate or implicate my ex as being a covert narcissist and he\\u2019s lying and a lot of what he has to say is not true. But I end up saying, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we let the way the kids interact with me speak for itself?\\u201d The kids were on recess and we call them in. They\\u2019re younger than they are now. My son is three or four and my daughter is maybe seven. They\\u2019re happy to see mama and I get lots of hugs. They do their child thing and are just playing. Then my ex coms over and parents them. He\\u2019s rough. From my point of view he seems so fucking manipulative. The kids come to me and I know I\\u2019m being observed by these two people. I\\u2019m totally firm with whatever discipline needs to happen. I\\u2019m also really kind and loving. The kids clearly love me and are not afraid of me, which is what my ex was trying to convince this counselor and teacher of. The kids aren\\u2019t. I\\u2019m their mother. I can see that both the teacher and counselor are putting the puzzle pieces together and seeing who and what my ex really is. I think the dream ends there with me just being with the kids and them not being afraid of me, which is not the story that their dad was telling the counselor and teacher. Then the dream shifts. I have a flash of being in a neighborhood with almost all of my high school friends - the kids I grew up with and went to school with. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, except we\\u2019re at this place for an event or conference. Everyone is whispering, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Tupac concert!\\u201d But the rest are like, \\u201cAnd he\\u2019s dead! Why would it be a Tupac concert?\\u201d The venue has water bordering the edges, so I\\u2019m not sure if we\\u2019re at the ocean or a river. There\\u2019s water on one edge of the surroundings. The other side is a town. I\\u2019m sitting with my friends and we\\u2019re kind of close to the stage. Nothing is happening yet because there are hours until they come on. We\\u2019re all basically like, \\u201cis it going to be Tupac? This band says that it\\u2019s Tupac but everyone knows he\\u2019s not alive anymore, so how is it possible?\\u201d The crowd keeps gathering and it\\u2019s more and more people that I know and grew up with. Then people that know my people are there, so it\\u2019s like six degrees of separation between everyone that\\u2019s there. We\\u2019re sitting at this table and they start to block off the stage and dancing areas. There\\u2019s a big block between the stage and where everyone is allowed to stand and watch. They allow me and my two friends to stay, but they remove the table so we\\u2019re just sitting there in these chairs. It\\u2019s getting kind of awkward because now everyone is staring at us and wondering why we\\u2019re in this space where no one else is allowed to be. Then, also everyone is staring because they\\u2019re anticipating this band coming up to play. I\\u2019m getting uncomfortable and at one point I realize my pants have disappeared and I\\u2019m in a bodysuit with snaps down at the bottom - this is kind of funny because it\\u2019s the kind of clothes my mom used to wear in the 1970s. It\\u2019s black. My friends are up and then they come back down and I\\u2019m just feeling so uncomfortable because everyone is watching me and I\\u2019m in just this bodysuit. I look down at one point and the snaps have come undone and my pussy is just hanging out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god! I hope no one saw that.\\u201d I tilt my body to the side and my friend helps me snap everything back so everything is covered. Then it\\u2019s time for the band to come on. They come on and they have all different kinds of instruments - saxophones and drums and guitar. I know Tupac is a rapper, but all the instruments on the stage are varied. Then the singers come on. Of course, it\\u2019s not Tupac. It\\u2019s a band and they start playing music. Everyone realizes Tupac is not coming out. It\\u2019s some kind of tribute band or something. I\\u2019m really ready to get out of this space where I feel like I\\u2019m on display and it feels so uncomfortable. The crowd has a bunch of kids in it. The kids are starting to run past the barricade that they have up to keep people away from the stage. The kids are starting to run in this grassy area where I\\u2019ve been this whole time. The security is letting some go but trying to catch some. I can\\u2019t tell if the kids are allowed to be there or not. I just know I\\u2019m ready to peace out. The music is also not very good. The dream ends with me leaving and the kids running amok and the band is not Tupac.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of people who are Irish river dancing. They\\u2019re all in traditional costumes but the costumes are wrong - they\\u2019re Swedish or Danish costumes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll watch this.\\u201d What\\u2019s weird is I\\u2019m watching Hank and Wendy. They\\u2019re dancing as part of the troupe. In my brain, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god, what are they doing in my dream again?\\u201d They\\u2019re dancing. Wendy comes up to me. Her hair is longer and she\\u2019s wearing a dress - I\\u2019ve never seen her in a dress, ever. She\\u2019s being really, really nice to me and I think she invites me to come dance or something. I decline. I\\u2019m with my partner Josh and we\\u2019re sitting and leaning against something. There\\u2019s an ingrown hair on my leg and it\\u2019s pretty painful. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ll get it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh, don\\u2019t touch it!\\u201d He reaches towards it and it\\u2019s on my left leg on the top of my thigh towards my knee. He goes to pop it and it squirts this huge amount of pus out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHoly shit! Was that just an ingrown? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I clean up all the pus and stuff that came out. He goes and pops it again. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLeave it alone.\\u201d But more stuff comes out and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d Now it\\u2019s fibrous. I clean that up then pop it one more time. Then tissue comes out of my leg. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough. Leave the freaking theme alone.\\u201d Weird stuff is coming out and I don\\u2019t know what is happening to my leg.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at my childhood home. It really does look like my childhood home. The backyard is like what I\\u2019m used to seeing. The house is just kind of like I know it, some of the pieces are the same. In the backyard now there is a lanai that goes all the way out and it\\u2019s glassed in with doors that have eight little square window panes. It looks like a greenhouse or sunporch. It also has an English period feel to it. It\\u2019s very bright. The sunroom is painted white. There\\u2019s silver everywhere - silver serving platters and whatnot. We\\u2019re not dressed fancy or anything; we\\u2019re in Hawaii and dressed comfortably. I see a plate of bacon on the porch. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes! Bacon!\\u201d I go to eat it and my mom is like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s from so and so, she brought it over. She\\u2019s trying it out to see if it\\u2019s the kind we like or want.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s interesting and wonder why they would be doing that. I know sometimes bacon is coated in flour and now I\\u2019m wary of trying it because I know I\\u2019m allergic. Then my brothers are showing up and they\\u2019re demolishing the bacon. When I look out at the backyard, I can see the stream and the cliff wall on the far side - I\\u2019ve had this in other dreams before. I\\u2019ve dreamt this landscape in dreams but it doesn\\u2019t actually match what my backyard looks like in real life. I can usually see to the other side of the stream a hill which I could go up and over. But this time is the cliff face on the far side and the water. There\\u2019s some sort of activity happening. There are a bunch of nice lawn chairs like you\\u2019d have for an event. They\\u2019re all set up on the lawn. I am looking through a pair of binoculars. My brothers are sitting in some of the chairs and my binoculars are rating them. My brothers are suddenly younger in age. The binoculars are like, \\u201cThis one is single and he plays sports, he\\u2019s a forward.\\u201d I look at the next one and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis one is too young for consideration.\\u201d Then I look at another one and the binoculars say something rude like, \\u201cNot cute.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow fuck you rude binoculars.\\u201d They don\\u2019t actually say things; they\\u2019re printing words at the bottom of my vision. It\\u2019s so strange and I don\\u2019t know why my brothers are being rated. There are two other guys. I don\\u2019t recognize them, but they\\u2019re youngish and fit within my brothers\\u2019 ages. They have what looks like soccer shin pads that I\\u2019ve made for them. They need them but I don\\u2019t know why. I\\u2019m sewing the shin pads into the box and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this because they\\u2019re going to need them eventually. I\\u2019m very meticulous, one tiny stitch at a time, sewing them into a cardboard box and plastic frame. All of a sudden I realize they\\u2019re going to need to wear these so why am I doing this because they won\\u2019t be able to get them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere are your shin pads. You\\u2019ll need them when you need them.\\u201d One of them asks me how to make the shin pads tight on their legs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s velcro, you just tighten it.\\u201d One of them is like, \\u201cNo, you might have to sew them onto me.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cI could sew through your skin but that would be weird.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, that might happen.\\u201d I\\u2019m confused internally. Part of me thinks that makes total sense and I might need to sew them onto their skin and it\\u2019s like a right of passage and that\\u2019s how I know they\\u2019re warriors. But the other part of my brain is like, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t sew skin.\\u201d Then the dream changes a little bit. I decide to go to the pool. I did not grow up with a pool so this is definitely out of my regular childhood home reality. I wade into the pool. It\\u2019s a huge rectangular pool, enclosed with glass windows on one side and some light coming in. There are double doors that look like the same doors on the sunporch. It\\u2019s like a boat ramp that you walk down and it slowly gets deeper and deeper. So I\\u2019m in the pool and at the far end where there is less light and a lot darker, there\\u2019s a room off to the left. Part of the room is underwater. Somebody opens the doors to this room. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I know that they\\u2019re not supposed to open those doors. Sure enough, this creature comes out of those doors. I\\u2019m scared. I don\\u2019t recall what the creature looks like. It\\u2019s coming into the main pool. I have swum out to where I can\\u2019t touch and now I\\u2019m swimming back to where I can get out of the water. I remember tentacles so maybe it was part octopus, but I\\u2019m not sure.\"],[\"\\u201cScavengers\\u201d The most meaningful picture from my dream is that everything was burnt. It was like a post after the fire burning of the world. Yet even though there was cooled lava stone kind of shell overtop everything that was alive, there were still some people left. So some people had survived. And some people had scavenged stuff from the rubble or had hammered the crust with something and broken off a piece of some piece of junk - like an item you\\u2019d normally buy in a store, that kind of junk - and had scrabbled a living from this. The people that had done that were emaciated and skinny like skeletons with vacant eyes. Their whole focus was on what they had scavenged and made into a business to sell. They weren\\u2019t chasing me and I wasn\\u2019t running from them. Because I was uninterested in their scavenged things, it was like they didn\\u2019t even notice I was there. So I was able to be invisible. At one point in the dream, one of them looked at me and I still remember that hollow kind of hungry gaze and it pierced me for a second, and then I think because I didn\\u2019t return it, I didn\\u2019t need it - I didn\\u2019t need anything it had, its hunger just retracted and then it was as though I was insignificant and it left me alone. They were quite frightening to look at, so was what they had - it was like things you get from the dump, but there were people that were buying it and it was so awful.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Golden Eagle\\u201d As is typical with all of my dreams, there are events that lead up to this one and continue on after. But I feel that this is the significant part of the dream: The setting is an outdoor space. It\\u2019s not a cultivated space; it\\u2019s more of a wild space. And there\\u2019s a gathering of people there - it\\u2019s a large gathering of people. It carries the frequency of a marketplace, but not a marketplace like we have today, probably more of one that would have been hundreds of years ago, pre-capitalism. There\\u2019s some people that have brought things with them to this gathering that they have created themselves, and there are other people that are there simply because it\\u2019s a gathering. There\\u2019s some people there that have never gathered there before and there\\u2019s some people that really feel like not only have they gathered there before, but direct generations of their family have gathered there before. So, I\\u2019m part of this. At the gathering, I\\u2019m alone though. I\\u2019m not part of the bigger groups of people that have come together and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m alone. The dream does not tell me. I\\u2019m standing there, just kind of absorbing the flavors and textures and frequency of the gathering when I open my eyes and see that there is a bird in the sky. The bird is flying and I\\u2019m looking at it, as the bird gets closer I identify it as an eagle, and then as it gets closer I notice the colors of its feathers and realize that it\\u2019s a golden eagle. At the same time that I\\u2019m noticing this, it is flying toward me at a rapid speed and I don\\u2019t really have time to process this in my dream. But I suddenly realize that as it gets closer and closer, it\\u2019s going to land on my head and then it does. I feel there was a moment of fear and then it was quickly dissipated by the feeling that it was not going to hurt me at all, but it landed on my head and I knew it was coming for me. As it lands on my head, I can feel my neck is almost buckling under the weight of it. The size of its feet were the size of my skull. I can feel the hard leathery feel of its toes - its digits. And I can feel a click of the smooth really hard texture of its talons. I can feel them on the sides of my skull and around the back, but they\\u2019re not squishing me - they\\u2019re not squeezing me. I know they have the power to, but they\\u2019re not. I can just feel their weight and texture. The bird\\u2019s front body is facing my back, so its tail feathers and the ends of its wings are around my face and shoulders. I can\\u2019t see anything now. It almost feels like a headdress. The bird bent over with its upper body and neck so I could feel its beak touch that big knuckle at the base of my cervical spine - the larger one, T3 - I feel its beak there. And while this is happening I can hear other people\\u2019s voices. When it first started getting closer I could hear other people saying, \\u201cHah! It\\u2019s a golden eagle!\\u201d like they\\u2019re all excited. And then some people were like: \\u201cLa, what\\u2019s it doing?!\\u201d And then when it landed on my head, I don\\u2019t remember anybody saying anything. So it must have been kind of quiet. And then it feels like the bird\\u2019s not talking to me, it\\u2019s not speaking English, but it feels like it relayed some kind of message and I don\\u2019t know what it is (in the dream I knew what it was), but I could not remember it when I woke up. And then the bird left. I remember I was feeling sad. I was already isolated when I was there, and I felt more sad when the bird left. Then I wake up, but I'm still in my dream. I wake up in my dream and have another dream. Then that dream returns to me, but time has passed. It\\u2019s been many gatherings in the same place later. This time I know the bird is coming. I sit down. I span my skirt out around me - it\\u2019s a long skirt. I\\u2019m in a comfortable position and I\\u2019m closing my eyes and I feel its approach more than see it. Instead of landing on my head this time, it lands on something beside me - something raised - I don\\u2019t know what it was - maybe it was just a stump or rock. It allows me to touch it this time. I do and I arrange its tail feathers. I just smooth that it\\u2019s gigantic - the size of my whole torso and head. And it\\u2019s more like a communion this time. It spends some time with me. It gets up and I know (not through English) that it\\u2019s telling me to follow it, so I do. It goes to the outskirts of this gathering to a higher tree. I just stand there in front of it and it sits there. I feel like it\\u2019s passing some kind of symbolic message to me and telling me that there are other people in this gathering that will understand it. And then I actually leave it - it doesn\\u2019t fly away - and go back into the market. It feels like there\\u2019s a frequency in the market, like a template that\\u2019s invisible, like a web, and it\\u2019s lifted and separate from the rest of the cacophony of bustle. I follow it and it leads me to someone that I know - I met her at a teacher training and we became instant friends; she moved after the training was over but we still keep in touch, but it was one of those instant things. She\\u2019s there and she\\u2019s been making these amulets and each one carries a symbol and she\\u2019s explaining to me what they are and I realize that the eagle has told me to seek her out. Then I wake up, that\\u2019s the end of my dream.\"],[\"The setting is the restaurant where I worked in university. It\\u2019s a busy restaurant in a mall and they\\u2019ve changed our uniforms over again, which they used to do twice a year. Sometimes the shirts were horrible, but the bottoms were always black jeans. Only this time instead of just changing our shirts, we had to wear tights. I hated it. They showed everything - they were not even the good kind of yoga pants, they were like cheap knock offs that didn\\u2019t even hold their shape. Not only did they show everything, but they were baggy, too. I really didn\\u2019t want to wear them. I don\\u2019t know how I got away with it. I was still wearing my black jeans and other servers were starting to wear these tights. I had a whole bunch of stuff in my backpack and I put it in the office for safekeeping - not really sure why I did that, but we did have a problem with theft. Anyway, I had a bunch of my stuff in the office and they were stupid things, too - plastic knick knacks like McDonald\\u2019s toys and I had them in a plastic container, like tupperware. When I finished my shift, they were still there and I was trying to put them in my apron and there were too many of them and I was losing track. Then when I went to leave the restaurant at the end of my shift, the good owner (not the shyster one) and two of the other staff, we needed to fix something for someone\\u2019s car so that they could actually leave. And so we walked over to this other store in the mall to assist the staff member with communicating what it was that needed to be fixed. It was like a diode or something that needed to be replaced - it was this little tiny part in this series of bigger complicated parts. So we waited there with her while the part was being replaced. Oh my god, it just went on and on and on, and the person that was supposed to be fixing it kept talking to other people and chatting. And I\\u2019m like oh, I have to get out of here and why is this taking so long. And I just got really agitated and frustrated when we were there. Finally the store employee went over and flipped one switch and it recharged her diode and then we went out and we popped it under the hood of her car, and she was off. I said goodbye to the other two people and then I was walking across the parking lot with the remaining person (I know her in real life) and she was telling me that she knows she\\u2019s going to end up alone one day. And I was like: \\u201cReally? I\\u2019m shocked!\\u201d (because in real life she has a husband and two kids and they\\u2019re a beautiful family unit). And she said: \\u201cYep, my husband is either all in or all out, and I\\u2019ve just always known that one day he\\u2019s going to be gone.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be okay with that?\\u201d And she said she is. And then I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand how people can just shut off their emotions like that.\\u201d I told her about what it felt like when Omar died and said it was (and I did the math in my head in my dreams)...I said I was 28, so that was 30, no 22 years ago, and I still think about him every day. He\\u2019s never gone out of my heart, and I just don\\u2019t understand loving somebody and then just not loving them. When you love someone, they\\u2019re always a part of you. And then of course, I woke up because the emotion from that is still really strong.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Grid\\u201d In my dream last night, I\\u2019m a time traveler. The framework of the dream is set up on a grid system. I have lived in Toronto, Ontario, but I don\\u2019t live there now (for a short period of time I was there) and it\\u2019s a very easy city to get to know if you spend some time on the grid, which is a north-south-east-west system. In the dream, if you stop at a washroom or go down into the subway, you end up in a different time zone when you come out. So the whole dream is me trying to gather people together so that we\\u2019re all going into these wormholes at the same time so we don\\u2019t lose each other. The interesting thing is I keep waking up out of this dream and then going back to sleep and simply picking up where it left off. But every time I go back to sleep. I\\u2019m trying to regather the people that I was with before I woke up. The dream starts and I\\u2019m with my own family and one of the places in the grid is a restaurant, but it\\u2019s one of the older kinds of restaurants where the upstairs also has sleeping rooms for travelers. Not all of the people in that time zone are good people, so I\\u2019m warning my daughter to stay away from one of these girls because I can just tell by the look of her that she\\u2019s a thief and a prostitute. She\\u2019s sizing us up and I know if we don\\u2019t keep our money and valuables safe, she will steal from us. I\\u2019m trying to get the door of the restaurant locked because the prostitute has gone off with Omar and I don\\u2019t want her to come back in because I don\\u2019t want her to follow us through the next wormhole. So I do manage to keep the door locked and the prostitute comes out an hour later from the doorway and she has only her underwear on and her bra and she\\u2019s saying she\\u2019s desperately trying to get in and I know this is part of the trick because I can tell by her face that she\\u2019s not really upset. And I just know this. I do manage to succeed in convincing them to keep the door locked. Then I see her coming out of a different doorway about five minutes later. She gets up and she\\u2019s fully dressed and I can see in her hand that she has two different wallets, so she managed to get them from someone else, but not us. So this is going to sound funny, but it\\u2019s winter in the dream on the grid, and I\\u2019ve got my kids\\u2019 things to carry plus some supplies - food and an extra change of clothes. And my daughter is pushing me around in a shopping cart - she keeps telling me to get in with my stuff and it\\u2019s hard to push it because it\\u2019s a shopping cart and the snow keeps building up on the wheels. So we\\u2019re putting the heavy things in there and I\\u2019m having a hard time pushing it and my daughter keeps wanting me to get in there and rest, and she is pushing me around so we look like homeless people. We go into this other portal and come out on the other side and it\\u2019s a party. It\\u2019s packed with people and there are people that I know. So, one of these couples that I know are people that I know from the Sail Club, and I realize that the man is screwing around on the woman and I think, \\u201cOh no, that\\u2019s horrible!\\u201d And I wrestle with the idea of telling her. And I don\\u2019t yet because it\\u2019s a really tough decision to make and is it any of my business, and what effects of that decision will it have on others. So while I\\u2019m wrestling with that decision, I realize that she is actually aware of it and just doesn\\u2019t appear to either care or acknowledge it, so I don\\u2019t tell her. In the same scene, there\\u2019s another little girl and she\\u2019s being shadowed by a teenage girl. So the first girl is 8 and the other is maybe 16. They go into the showers and I\\u2019m standing there because I\\u2019m on this other girl because of the shadowing. So they both get into the same shower and I\\u2019m thinking this isn\\u2019t right. And then I walk in and look and they are showering together and they are undressed. I step in and open the door and I ask the younger girl, \\u201cAre you alright?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t answer me. So I glare at the other one and fierce her down and take the younger girl and put some clothes on her because her clothes have disappeared, so I\\u2019m just taking some various things and covering her up with them. I say, \\u201cIs this yours? Is this yours?\\u201d and people say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not mine,\\u201d and so I put a various eclectic wardrobe on her. And then I\\u2019m wandering around the party with her in my hand asking anyone if they know who this girl is because she doesn\\u2019t talk. People will say, \\u201cOh, I saw her with so and so,\\u201d and then the so and so won\\u2019t be there and there\\u2019s different so and so\\u2019s every time and I can\\u2019t find who this girl belongs to. But then I\\u2019m starting to get concerned that I\\u2019m getting sucked into or overly involved with the dynamics of the people at this party and I\\u2019m afraid that I will forget that I\\u2019m a time traveler and that I\\u2019ll lose my time traveler family, so I start to gather up the people that I came with - my daughter, some other nameless people who are just there, they are part of my travel group - and I\\u2019m looking for someone now. I say I need someone to take care of her for me, and this couple - the oblivious woman and the man who is screwing around on her all the time - say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take her. We\\u2019ll love her. We love everybody.\\u201d In the dream I\\u2019m not concerned that she\\u2019ll be sexually abused. I know that they are going to take care of her. They\\u2019re good people, they just have this other weird cake. And so I leave her with them and get back into the shopping cart outside of the door and we go down and I\\u2019m starting to recognize streets. I\\u2019m starting to look a lot more closely at the grid because I want to plan where we\\u2019re going and not just go into any door and be more conscious of the grid. I\\u2019m starting to feel more textures in the dream. So as I climb back in the cart, I\\u2019m feeling that the front handle of it is actually cold and it\\u2019s plastic feeling and the metal of the cart is even colder and I\\u2019m trying to pull the sleeve of my coat down over my hand so it won\\u2019t stick to it. It\\u2019s actually not that comfortable riding in it because the wheels keep getting stuck and it\\u2019s bumpy. But this is what she wants to do and I let her. We have some conversations. She\\u2019s still bothered by locking the prostitute out of the first scene, and I tell her that regardless of what we did she would still steal everyone\\u2019s wallets and she would still make the same choices and it\\u2019s not our purpose to try and change people\\u2019s choices here, but to learn the grid and to find our way through it. So I\\u2019m starting to read the signs and I\\u2019m recognizing where we are - what starts to become a sense of direction in the grid. My daughter keeps steering the cart. Now I don\\u2019t know where my consciousness goes during this - maybe I go to sleep in the dream and I wake up. Instead of staying on the grid we\\u2019ve gone off to side grid things and we\\u2019re in smaller parts because she likes them better because they are closer together and more intimate, but they don\\u2019t have any identifying characteristics. So it\\u2019s a lot harder for me to find the main patterns of the grid when she does this, but we do. So the second time I dive in and dive out, it\\u2019s me finding our way out of this non-identifiable part onto more of the main grid. And then we come to a wormhole that I know we\\u2019re supposed to go into and I don\\u2019t want to go in, so I linger outside of it. Now it\\u2019s just my daughter and I. Because she went off the grid, we lost the other people we were supposed to be traveling with. I\\u2019m hoping that by staying on the grid, we\\u2019ll find them the next time we pop up somewhere. I also think that maybe if we wait, they might pop up out of this wormhole because I think they\\u2019re going to be looking for us. So while we\\u2019re waiting around this one crossroads, I talk or make a connection with an older man. At first he\\u2019s just an older man. We just have a conversation about some kind of philosophy or something. I\\u2019m not really paying much attention to the conversation. Then we decide to go down into the wormhole and we do, and we\\u2019re staying together and I\\u2019m giving her instructions, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta make sure we don\\u2019t get separated. Don\\u2019t go off onto any areas without telling me.\\u201d We pop up successfully and I see the rest of the people that we\\u2019re supposed to be with and we rush and we connect back with them. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember exactly what they said, but they\\u2019re telling us what happened during their wormhole experience. The interesting thing about this as the dream is starting to come to a close is that together we find the next wormhole that we\\u2019re supposed to dive into, but people keep needing to go to the washroom. But I\\u2019m telling them they can\\u2019t do this because each washroom is a wormhole and we\\u2019re supposed to stay together. Some of them decide to do it anyway and I know that here we go again, we\\u2019re going to get sidetracked from our purpose. Well, we keep trying to find each other. And then I see this old man again and he\\u2019s standing up - he\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am. Now as I start talking to him I\\u2019m not just seeing him for what his profession is with small talk, but I start to feel beyond the surface of his skin into the character and kind of being he is, and he\\u2019s just so beautiful on the inside. My being feels his being. I tell him that once I go down into the wormhole, I won\\u2019t ever see him again. And he says, \\u201cyes, I know.\\u201d And then we just start to hug, but it\\u2019s the kind of hug where you just kind of fall into the other person - it\\u2019s not a squeezy hug, it\\u2019s just so enveloping and I just stand there. It seems like five minutes go by and I\\u2019m so comforted by this hug. And I realize as we\\u2019re doing this that we also need to not get so preoccupied with staying on the grid, that we\\u2019re missing the connections with the people that are in between wormholes. And then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Mission\\u201d In this dream I am aware that there are other beings in the world that we live in. They don\\u2019t have a body or faces. We can\\u2019t see them, I don\\u2019t know what they look like but I do know they are there. They reveal other parts of the dimensions that we live in when the right people are gathered together. Some of the people are oblivious to the fact that they\\u2019re supposed to gather together and others are not. So the dream flips between scenes where people are gathering. There\\u2019s always one person that is aware that the gathering has occurred. In each house where this happens, the curtains are supposed to stay slightly open, and when everyone has arrived, the curtains are closed. And then some other kind of message will come through, left by these other beings. It changes every time. You have to look for it, too. For example, one of them was actually underneath a flyer on a telephone pole. I was looking for the message and kept expanding the search area outside of the house to wider areas until I thought, \\u201cThe messages are never this far away from the actual home.\\u201d So I retraced my steps and went back and found it underneath the flyer. There\\u2019s some violence in it that I can\\u2019t just speak of. What I came away with from this dream is that there\\u2019s a frequency layer on the planet where people just don\\u2019t care about the lives of other beings - whether animals, peoples or plants - they are just completely removed from the heartbeats that make things live. The other thing is that when the right people are gathered, you can evolve through that and you move past it. Not past the violence, but past the frequency that\\u2019s your everyday existence. But if you lived in isolation and didn't come together in groups, none of these fantastical conversations would happen when you discover something new. The layer of other dimensional beings remained with me when I woke up and I couldn't go back to sleep - it was that other layer of detachment and being observed that I really didn\\u2019t like.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cake\\u201d I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I tell him that sure, I\\u2019ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn\\u2019t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it\\u2019s run by a temperamental chef. There\\u2019s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I\\u2019m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they\\u2019re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they\\u2019re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they\\u2019re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I\\u2019m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I\\u2019m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there\\u2019s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there\\u2019s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover\\u2019s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She\\u2019s about 10. And she\\u2019s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn\\u2019t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she\\u2019s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn\\u2019t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn\\u2019t upset about it. He\\u2019s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he\\u2019s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn\\u2019t address the cake. Now we\\u2019re in a car and we\\u2019re driving up this beautiful roadway - it\\u2019s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there\\u2019s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in when you\\u2019re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It\\u2019s a perfect day and there\\u2019s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it\\u2019s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cPhotographs\\u201d The setting is somewhere I\\u2019ve never been before. I don\\u2019t recognize it. The population is a higher density than I\\u2019ve lived anywhere in Canada. I\\u2019ve never lived anywhere else other than here, so I'm not sure. The architecture I\\u2019m positive is much older than contemporary. It\\u2019s not made of stone though, so it\\u2019s not Medieval, it\\u2019s not Renaissance. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Northern European either. I\\u2019m feeling it\\u2019s more Mediterranean or something closer to the Equator, though it\\u2019s not as hot climate wise. It\\u2019s very colorful. There\\u2019s a lot of curves to the architecture and extra pieces added on, too, and it\\u2019s not just a box structure. There\\u2019s artistic pieces added on so it looks pleasing to the eye. It\\u2019s very artsy in this community. People make everything by hand. There\\u2019s a lot of thought put into it first. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be hierarchy of economy either or social standing. So what you eat, what you wear and your craft are all socially equal. So when you go to have food, you pick each item from the person who has created it. Then you create your food together. You can also go to a cook who is making food for others. You don\\u2019t just go in there, order at a counter and buy it. You have a conversation and then the cook shares a dish with you that he/she/they think you would like. So it\\u2019s quite different and very beautiful. I am a representative of life. In my dream I\\u2019m not called a photographer. I don\\u2019t actually have a camera. I have something that takes shadows so it\\u2019s a light. There\\u2019s a background and then once the light is shined on the object or person, it\\u2019s the outline that represents who they are. I make these for people. So they\\u2019ll come in and have a conversation with me and when I think it\\u2019s time, I\\u2019ll shine the light (with their permission, that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re there for, it\\u2019s not uninvited) and create a shadow for them. Lots of times this is done in exchange for foods or other gifts. This is a barter system economy. I\\u2019m very happy there. The dream comes to a conclusion in two ways. There seems to be a theme in my dreams lately where they\\u2019re both/and. Things are happening at the same time. So at the same time as I am creating a shadow piece for myself, I am also in the place where the person who cooks for other people is cooking. I\\u2019m in there just sitting. I\\u2019m actually studying some of my own work. The cook is androgynous. That seems to be another theme. I\\u2019m talking to them just in little bits. It\\u2019s a very comfortable conversation - the way you would have a conversation with someone you lived with for a long period of time where you say a couple of sentences and they respond and you\\u2019re both kind of doing your own thing. Fifteen minutes go by and then you make another couple remarks. It\\u2019s like that. So I\\u2019m in there and I\\u2019m aware that there\\u2019s a man that comes in. He\\u2019s trying to order a sandwich the way we would here now. The cook is not responding to him. So I\\u2019m aware that this exchange is unsuccessfully occuring in the sidelines of my consciousness. It gets to a point where I\\u2019m uncomfortable continuing to do what I\\u2019m doing there because this is disruptive. I\\u2019m aware that the cook is agitated. I\\u2019m aware also that the man is not going to go away. I feel compassion and want to stand in to alleviate the discomfort. So I go behind where the food is prepared. I start talking to the cook in the way I would talk to the cook before I was offered something to eat, hoping that by modeling the behavior, the man is going to understand. He doesn\\u2019t. Instead he thinks that I\\u2019m another employee. He starts trying to get me to make the sandwich. I don\\u2019t. But the cook responds to me and gives me a couple slices of tomato. So I go get a plate and put the tomato slices on a plate and bring it over to where I had been doing my own work. He looks puzzled at first and then a little bit angry. I assume that he\\u2019s been thinking, \\u201cWow, I\\u2019ve been standing here asking for something for x number of minutes, and she just walks in there and starts helping herself and gets service.\\u201d And then he reaches over as though he\\u2019s going to help himself, and then someone else materializes on the scene and grabs his arm and removes it. There\\u2019s a commotion. The man is eventually removed because he won\\u2019t listen and he won\\u2019t start trying to force a sandwich because none is appearing. I realize that I\\u2019m describing this, my consciousness is flipping back and forth from this scene through the portal of my work that I\\u2019m trying to focus on. In my own work, I am adjusting my own posture so I can get the line of the shadow that I want through this piece. The piece is created by wearing a sarong just between your navel and your hips. It\\u2019s not a flowy sarong, it\\u2019s more like the ones you see in Egyptian photos where the material is thicker and the piece that hangs over the front is wide - it\\u2019s not flowy, it\\u2019s made of a stiffer fabric. On the top fabric goes around the ribcage up to the nipples, so they start at the bottom rib - the material is stiffer - and they go up towards the nipples. What keeps happening is every time I adjust this piece of fabric over my own body, it goes over top of my nipples and I\\u2019m trying to get it to say just below the line of the nipples so you see the actual line of the nipples in the outline and then it goes down the rest of the body. Also in my dream, my physical body is getting really turned on by this. Every time it happens in my dream, I find it hard to stay in the dream. So the moment I get this right. There it is! The shadow is exactly the way I want it to look and feel, it\\u2019s just like Boom! My whole body is electrified. That\\u2019s the end of the dream. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cash\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town and I\\u2019m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They\\u2019re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I\\u2019m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it\\u2019s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there\\u2019s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they\\u2019re not making any sound, so I\\u2019m suspecting that it\\u2019s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don\\u2019t have that much money yet. I\\u2019m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don\\u2019t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I\\u2019m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I\\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table. They\\u2019ve wandered off now and I\\u2019m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I\\u2019m sensing another presence there that I can\\u2019t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what\\u2019s wrong with my car. He\\u2019s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic\\u2019s and I tell them exactly what\\u2019s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don\\u2019t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I\\u2019ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, \\u201cYay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.\\u201d And they\\u2019re saying, \\u201cOh wow, that\\u2019s fantastic.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn\\u2019t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.\\u201d So I\\u2019m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I\\u2019m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar\\u2019s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he\\u2019s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I\\u2019ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, \\u201cOh, what was wrong with it?\\u201d And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I\\u2019m cautious as Mike asks me what\\u2019s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, \\u201cOh? How did you know to say that?\\u201d because he knows even though I\\u2019m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don\\u2019t know the exact language to call the parts. And he\\u2019s looking at me. And I\\u2019m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I\\u2019m thinking is that I don\\u2019t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he\\u2019s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we\\u2019re in shifts and changes and we\\u2019re sitting in his mom\\u2019s actual house on the couch in the living room. There\\u2019s a picture of Omar on the end table. I\\u2019ve got my one arm around the back of Mike\\u2019s shoulders soothing him. I\\u2019m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, \\u201cOmar told you, didn\\u2019t he?\\u201d and I said, \\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d And then I say to him: \\u201care you okay?\\u201d And he puts his head down and it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom\\u2019s house are gone. We\\u2019re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we\\u2019re in it. Omar\\u2019s at the wheel and he\\u2019s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He\\u2019s tapping the gas pedal and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201chmm well this is good.\\u201d I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, \\u201cyeah and look how much cash I\\u2019ve got left over.\\u201d He laughs. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that extra cash?\\u201d And I know what I\\u2019m going to do with it, but I haven\\u2019t told anyone. So we\\u2019re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it\\u2019s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we\\u2019re driving down Colburn for a block and now it\\u2019s the year it would be now. I\\u2019m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an ice cream store over there. That\\u2019s new. There\\u2019s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there\\u2019s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn\\u2019t changed.\\u201d Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing? Now we\\u2019re back on Kent St.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.\\u201d He looks at me and we\\u2019re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I\\u2019ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing here?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I\\u2019ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.\\u201d I give it to him and I say, \\u201cGo buy a guitar. Just do it!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d So we go into the store and we\\u2019re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, \\u201cOh what one are you interested in?\\u201d Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, \\u201cWell, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn\\u2019t have the pickup and it\\u2019s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.\\u201d So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.\\u201d (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYes!\\u201d And he says, \\u201cDone!\\u201d So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they\\u2019re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that\\u2019s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there\\u2019s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There\\u2019s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There\\u2019s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it\\u2019s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he\\u2019s doing. It looks like he\\u2019s making chocolate chip cookies. He\\u2019s got the dough rolled out and there\\u2019s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, \\u201cWhat the hell?!\\u201d I walk up and I\\u2019m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they\\u2019re not even chocolate chips. They\\u2019re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I\\u2019m thinking, oh my god, that\\u2019s gross, but I\\u2019m fascinated that he\\u2019s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: \\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\\u201d and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they\\u2019ve already gone out of that room and I know they\\u2019re going down a hall and there\\u2019s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There\\u2019s no tools in front of him and no table. He\\u2019s faking working. I realize that he\\u2019s eavesdropping, he\\u2019s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my dream?! You\\u2019ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.\\u201d He starts telling me that he\\u2019s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It\\u2019s bullshit what he\\u2019s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don\\u2019t want to lose them and I certainly don\\u2019t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it\\u2019s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He\\u2019s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like \\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, \\u201cThis is Errant, my ex-husband.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cThis is Omar.\\u201d As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar\\u2019s hand, I realize that there\\u2019s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant\\u2019s going to be mad about this and he\\u2019s going to pound it out into me because he\\u2019s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I\\u2019m like I can\\u2019t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don\\u2019t want that handshake to join. Errant says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad,\\u201d as though he knows Omar\\u2019s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, \\u201cFor fucks sake! He knows that and he\\u2019s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He\\u2019s inserting himself here and of course, Omar\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh thanks very much.\\u201d He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, \\u201cOh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.\\u201d I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I\\u2019m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there\\u2019s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I\\u2019m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he\\u2019s a jerk, don\\u2019t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I\\u2019m still so agitated I can\\u2019t calm myself down in the dream. I\\u2019m feeling both threatened that Errant\\u2019s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I\\u2019m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I\\u2019m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won\\u2019t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I\\u2019m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.\"],[\"\\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go\\u201d / \\u201cDreams and Heartache\\u201d The setting in this dream is a campground where people would go with their RVs. There\\u2019s water and electricity on each camp, and huts where they have table tennis and ping pong, a nice shower, the washing machine and dryer and stuff like that. So I\\u2019m in the campground in an RV - it\\u2019s mine - and I\\u2019m sitting in a chair watching the sunset and this really good looking guy comes up and asks if he can join me. So I say yes and he sits down in the chair beside me. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and there\\u2019s some chemistry. He asks if he could see me again and if I would like to share dinner with him the next night and I say yes. So instantly it\\u2019s the next night and he\\u2019s brought dinner over. It\\u2019s a box of triscuit crackers. I can\\u2019t even eat wheat and in the dream I don\\u2019t ask if they\\u2019re gluten-free, but I look at what he\\u2019s brough and think, hmm this was not quite my idea of dinner. I excuse myself and say just a moment. I\\u2019ve gone back into my RV to get plates, knives and forks. I put a plate, knife and fork in front of each of us. He pours the crackers onto the plate and he pours two on each plate. I\\u2019m thinking to myself, wow, there isn\\u2019t even anything to go on top of the crackers. So he cuts his into 4 pieces, each cracker into 4 pieces. He asks me if I would like him to cut my food. He\\u2019s being chivalrous and galant about it. I accept his offer, but say I would like mine cut into 5 pieces please. I think this is funny because the triscuits won\\u2019t cut nicely into five pieces. They\\u2019re breaking and crumbling. He\\u2019s trying to cut mine into 5 pieces and I\\u2019m giggling under my breath. As he is struggling with this, I have a journal and pen in front of me. I\\u2019m writing a song called, \\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go.\\u201d It\\u2019s got song lyrics to rhyme and I think these are terribly clever. I\\u2019m using a tune to a popular rock song and am humming along as I do it. In the next part of the dream, the good looking guy is still struggling with the crackers. I walk across the RV park to the laundromat and I see my ex husband, Errant, and my son, and they\\u2019re talking to each other and preparing some food - now the laundromat also has a kitchen. I sit down in the chair waiting for them to finish what they\\u2019re doing. Errant sits down beside me, leans in and asks me what I dreamt about the night before. I start telling him - I get two sentences in and he gets up as if I wasn\\u2019t even saying anything and just walks off. He\\u2019s gone back to the kitchen. So I just sit in the chair feeling heartache. I get up out of my chair and walk into the kitchen where they are. Then my son asks me what I dreamt about and I start telling him. He would normally sit down and listen or exchange his own, and he does the exact same thing that Errant just did - listens for one sentence as though I didn\\u2019t say anything and leaves and goes upstairs. I sit back down in the chair feeling that I should not have exposed my son to Errant because he\\u2019s picking up his bad behaviors. I worry about that - how he will treat another partner in the future.\"],[\"\\u201cBoundaries and Brats\\u201d This dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019ve had lots of dreams set in this house. It\\u2019s long and narrow, although the rooms are plenty big enough - they\\u2019re just longer than they are wide. There're houses in New Orleans called shotgun houses because they\\u2019re long like that and the entrance to all the rooms are off the hallway, so if you\\u2019re driving by and shooting a gun, you could shoot a bullet in the front door and it goes all the way through the house and out the backdoor. So I guess it\\u2019s a shotgun house. We\\u2019re in the very back room of this house, which is my bedroom. We\\u2019re having a house discussion, so all the people that live there are having a conversation about pets. We have lots and I love pets. But one of them has a cow and I don\\u2019t want it lying on my bed because it runs around outside and in the backyard, too, where there\\u2019s poops lying around on the grass, so it\\u2019s got poops on its feet or it could have at any given time. I don\\u2019t want that on my bed. So I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cAnimals, if they can be trained to stay on the floor, then that\\u2019s fine, they\\u2019re allowed in my room. But if they\\u2019re up on my bed, then I won\\u2019t also allow them in my room.\\u201d The cow is in the room while we\\u2019re saying this. As I\\u2019m talking, it\\u2019s doing this sad eyes and pouty mouth. First it puts its head in my lap and looks sad, then it rolls a little bit at a time, like a toddler does when they\\u2019re limp and you\\u2019re trying to get them to walk and they just turn into a blob. It\\u2019s doing this. Then it\\u2019s on the bed. So I push it off and it\\u2019s heavy - it\\u2019s got a great big belly and it\\u2019s bigger than I am and it\\u2019s head is the size of my torso. But I push it back onto the floor and it looks at me mournfully. But I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, get off my bed.\\u201d But the people I\\u2019m having this discussion with don\\u2019t even hear me. And they say, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s alright if the cow is on your bed as long as your bed is made and the quilt is on.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo! I just finished saying, not on my bed under any circumstances!\\u201d Then the dream instantaneously is full of people and one of the roommates is having a birthday party for an 8-10 year old kid. So it feels like there\\u2019s hundreds of these kids around and they start opening my drawers and pulling out my shirts. One of them has a pair of scissors and they\\u2019re making costumes to dress up with. She starts to cut up one of my shirts and use the pieces of it for something else. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not allowed to do that, get out of my dresser. Close the drawer.\\u201d She looks at me and rolls her eyes like that 13 year old girl way - make a face. Then she leaves, but I see her looking back as she\\u2019s leaving and I intuit that she\\u2019s just waiting until I\\u2019m out of my room and she\\u2019s going to come back in anyway. So I put my clothes that they\\u2019ve taken out back in the dresser drawers. So there\\u2019s nothing on the floor and my room is back intact again. I close the door. I go through this crowd of kids to look for the roommate who is responsible for them. This person has no defining features, I can\\u2019t tell if they\\u2019re a man or woman, they\\u2019re just a roommate. I say to the roommate, \\u201cYou need to tell these kids that they\\u2019re not allowed in my room.\\u201d They\\u2019re like a phantom. I don\\u2019t really get a response from them and I realize it\\u2019s my responsibility to keep these kids out of my room. So I turn around and I see my bedroom door is open. So I go back in. This time I\\u2019m angry and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI told you guys not to do this and you\\u2019re doing it anyway! I\\u2019m taking your scissors and all this stuff you\\u2019ve made because you\\u2019re not respecting this!\\u201d I kick them out of my room again with these angry words and push them out with my hands. I can feel my hands making contact with them. Now they\\u2019re giving me the angry teenager rolling eyes angry look. So they\\u2019re looking back at me and I\\u2019m standing there like grrrr. I look down the hallway and the roommate is now aware of my displeasure and decides to take them to a movie instead. But it\\u2019s communicated to me that it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re respecting my boundaries or making the kids aware that there are boundaries they need to follow, but that \\u201cOh well Freya is grumpy and terrible so we\\u2019re just going to go somewhere else.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cCommunity\\u201d There\\u2019s a lot of mundane stuff that I won\\u2019t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they\\u2019re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she\\u2019s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re not triggered that you see her.\\u201d And my non-dream psyche answers back, \\u201cNo, hmm, I\\u2019m not.\\u201d But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we\\u2019re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it\\u2019s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We\\u2019re having casual conversations. It\\u2019s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There\\u2019s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He\\u2019s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he\\u2019s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he\\u2019s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it\\u2019s odd. I realize as I\\u2019m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn\\u2019t stand living there - one of the things I\\u2019ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that\\u2019s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there\\u2019s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he\\u2019s gathered all these people together. We\\u2019ve all brought our own food. He\\u2019s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who\\u2019s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property\\u2019s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it\\u2019s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it\\u2019s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. \\u201cOh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!\\u201d \\u201cI can store my snowmobile here!\\u201d \\u201cI can put my motorcycle here!\\u201d \\u201cOh here\\u2019s a big place I can take my dog out to run!\\u201d So it\\u2019s this whole building of community and that\\u2019s what the dream was about.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Wall\\u201d The second dream, I\\u2019m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I\\u2019m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they\\u2019ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won\\u2019t be aware of what they\\u2019ve actually been doing. I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they\\u2019re hiding, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you even hiding that? It\\u2019s just a book.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I\\u2019m still a teenager in it, though, and I\\u2019ve moved out of their house but I\\u2019ve gone back for a visit. There\\u2019s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there\\u2019s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I\\u2019m looking at what she\\u2019s brought out. I see a couple things and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! That was mine! I don\\u2019t remember hiding that and I didn\\u2019t even notice I was missing it.\\u201d So in the dream, we\\u2019re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don\\u2019t know what to do with mine. I guess I don\\u2019t have any pockets. I can\\u2019t seem to think in the dream, \\u201cOh why don\\u2019t I just take them with me?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m encumbered with the idea that the mom can\\u2019t see it and I\\u2019ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, \\u201cMom, Freya\\u2019s been hiding things in the wall.\\u201d Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she\\u2019s really disappointed in me that I\\u2019ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I\\u2019m thinking I don\\u2019t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I\\u2019m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Altar\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m living in a large house - it\\u2019s an older farmhouse and it\\u2019s surrounded by forest. The architecture is intricate and beautiful - almost like a mini castle. In my dream, I do not go in the house. The dream occurs outside the house. Imagine standing on the front porch of that house looking forward and you\\u2019re surrounded by an arc of tables. The middle of the arc extends outwards from the house and the two ends wrap around the outside to where the beam for the house would be. The tables are eclectic - there\\u2019s all different kinds and shapes that create this arc. I am involved with arranging things on the tables. Each table tells its own story and so do the objects on it. The dream begins where I\\u2019ve already set up and created the stories on all tables except this one that I am struggling with to bring into the arc so that it doesn\\u2019t stick out in some unseemly way from the general shape the tables are creating together. I\\u2019m a little frazzled because I can\\u2019t get the table to move. It\\u2019s stuck somehow. I\\u2019m also under some kind of time crunch where I need to meet with someone else, a friend, A.T. We are to go to this other ceremony that\\u2019s a type of reunion. So it\\u2019s time to go and I have to leave the table where it is, standing off like an unabsorbed cell. I meet A.T. and we are dressed for the ceremony. We walk over to it. The ceremony is some kind of presentation of some kind of award, but I never pay attention to it because my interactions are on the outside of that. In the group of people, each one is someone I haven\\u2019t seen in a really long time. We have some conversations. I realize that I am needed back at the arc at this table. I can\\u2019t stay for as many of the conversations as I would like to. So I feel that i\\u2019m unable to be absorbed into the interactions of that crowd at this ceremony as I would like because my duties required back at the house are calling me. As I say my goodbyes I\\u2019m making my way back to the house, I realize that I do need to get this table integrated with the arc of the other tables because once it is, I will be moving onto something else. Again, I\\u2019m struggling with the table and my friend, A.T. is supposed to be with me, but she\\u2019s still lingering back at the other ceremony and I\\u2019m slightly irritated by her tardiness. She\\u2019s supposed to be helping me and here I am waiting for her and now I\\u2019m starting to get anxious that I\\u2019m going to miss the entry into this next realm because she\\u2019s late. But she shows up at the last minute. We still have to get changed. We need to wear different things to move into this other realm. We manage that. I go back into the house and do that. I dash in, change clothes and then come back out. I get the table integrated into the arc and I put some things on it. The items are furry. They speak of a time that is much earlier than the time I\\u2019m in and by placing them on the table, I\\u2019m transported back into the time they came from. My friend does move with me through this portal, but then she goes off to whatever she\\u2019s supposed to be doing here and it\\u2019s not what I am doing. The physical setting here is made of stone - like a stone doorway with a lot of different stones making up a mound and there\\u2019s simply a space between them where I exit out of. There\\u2019s stones along the right hand side of me and I touch them. There\\u2019s kind of thorny things growing up along the other side and wrapping over my head. The brush here is very dense. I\\u2019m following the only path I can as I cannot go off the left because the thorns are too thick. It slopes downwards and I enter into a small clearing and there\\u2019s some other people there. They\\u2019re dressed in furs and they\\u2019ve got skins wrapped around their feet. They\\u2019re aware of me, but they don\\u2019t interact with me. I\\u2019m to set things out on a stone tablet there - some items for them. But we don\\u2019t speak the same language and I can\\u2019t describe to them what I\\u2019m doing, but I sense they\\u2019re waiting for me to do it. In order to achieve that, I need to make contact with someone else. I\\u2019m looking around for him. Then I do suddenly see him and he sees me. I reach out and I make sure that I take his hand slow enough that the other people are aware that we\\u2019ve made contact because that will put them at ease and it will also show them that I have some kind of power. So we do this and I pull him in with me back up the hill to where the clearing was, which is where I entered this realm. We lie down together and embrace. It felt really nice - I remember that feeling. The items we were supposed to lay out on the flat piece of stone - we do that and then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Toothbrush\\u201d In this dream, I am on my way to a concert in Toronto. I\\u2019m with a couple friends - one is a friend of mine, A.G., and the other is my first boyfriend for a little while in high school. We\\u2019ll call him Daren. So in this dream, I\\u2019m with A.G. and Daren. and we\\u2019re on our way to a concert. We stop at his parent\\u2019s place which isn\\u2019t where his parents actually lived. It\\u2019s in a city called Burlington and they\\u2019re living on Plains Rd. The house is really dense on the inside. It\\u2019s like a hoarder house where you can\\u2019t walk through the hallways. You can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on the other end of the hallways. They have all these pets that they\\u2019re constantly looking for because they can\\u2019t find them in all this hoarding mess. So we arrive there and I guess we have to stay overnight. We\\u2019ve arrived late and the concert is the next day in the afternoon, so we\\u2019ve decided to go and sleep there because it\\u2019s closer to leave from his parents\\u2019 place. When we get there, his mom is looking for one of the pets - it\\u2019s this weird amalgamation of a dog and a cat. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog but when I look more closely at it, it has the body of a cat and the neck and head of a dog. We see it for a moment and then it\\u2019s gone again. So all of us are trying to squeeze our way through this house. It seems like in the dream I\\u2019m doing this without any contact from anyone else for what feels like hours. Then I come out into the kitchen and I see Daren and I ask him if he\\u2019s had any luck. He says, \\u201cNot yet, but there\\u2019s this whole other half of the house I haven\\u2019t checked.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say this outloud but I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, this house is so much bigger than it appears to be because of all the stuff.\\u201d So we start off together into the doorway through the other side of the house. It\\u2019s like the air in there is colder - the way it would feel if you were going down in altitude into a cave where it just feels damper and colder, but it still has stuff in it. I can\\u2019t see anything. I see this other creature. It\\u2019s a combination of a hedgehog and a guinea pig. It walks past me and Daren says to me, \\u201cMake sure you don\\u2019t let that guy out.\\u201d I look and suddenly realize there\\u2019s a pocket door I could close, so I do. The little creature stays in there. We get out of this next hallway and his mom and dad are sitting in the next clearing. Daren tells them that he hasn\\u2019t been able to find the dog. Then I look over and I say, \\u201cIs that it?\\u201d It\\u2019s partially masked by some other thing and I can\\u2019t even figure out what this creature is. It\\u2019s black and it has limbs, but there\\u2019s no discernable face on it. Daren says, \\u201cYes that\\u2019s it!\\u201d And he goes over and gets it and picks it up and takes it to his mom. They\\u2019re so happy and patting it. I leave them there and see there\\u2019s a door behind the dad which actually has daylight. I decide to leave out that door, walk all the way around and come in the other door we entered in. It\\u2019s a measure of avoiding all these cluttered passages. So I do that and when I come in, my friend is trying to kiss Daren and I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cThat\\u2019s very strange behavior for her and awkward!\\u201d But he pulls back and walks over. Now I have a cup of tea in my hand and I\\u2019m sitting at a table and I see that his eyes are actually filling up with tears. He\\u2019s upset that she did that. I say, \\u201cWell, why didn\\u2019t you tell her? You should have said something.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ruin this for everyone.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll go over and say something\\u201d He tells me not to for the same reason - it will ruin this event. I\\u2019m sitting with this and thinking that it\\u2019s kind of ruined anyway. It\\u2019s awkward and with no one talking about it, it will just sit there and fester. Then he says, \\u201cAre you ready to go?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat? No! I haven\\u2019t even finished my tea.\\u201d I realize that when I came in, I had a toothbrush and I brushed my teeth in the bathroom. I can\\u2019t figure out how to get through all these hallways with the clutter to go back and check the bathroom. I look through my suitcase which is just a little carry case like a backpack with a whole bunch of zippers. I\\u2019m opening all the zippers and looking in each compartment and it looks like it has my belongings in it, but each zippered compartment is empty. There's no toothbrush and I tell him I don\\u2019t want to leave without brushing my teeth. He does the eye roll thing, \\u201cYou better hurry up, I don\\u2019t want to be late.\\u201d So the rest of the dream I\\u2019m lifting up things and looking underneath them, trying to find my toothbrush.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Well\\u201d Last night I dreamt I was in a garden but the dream didn\\u2019t start in the garden, it started in the city. The city looked like I was walking around in Roman times - it was the architecture. Things were made of stone, there were carvings everywhere. It was very lush, actually, with Mediterranean type plants (not Amazon). As I walked through the city, I was kind of leaving the cosmopolitan area of it and walking to a place that was quiet. In this place, too, I felt like a lot of time had lapsed since I had been there the time before. Things were not the way they were the last time I had seen them. There were stones in the garden that instead of being upright, they were lying down and I couldn\\u2019t see what had been carved on them. I knew that something was carved on them and they\\u2019d all been turned down so that you couldn\\u2019t see what was on them. So I was making my way past them. No one else was there, just me. The plants had grown around them so they\\u2019d been turned down for some time. Eventually I came to a well. This well had stonework built up around it so there was about a 4 foot ledge around the well. I was leaning on it with my forearms and gazing downwards into its darkness. I could hear the sounds of water. I could smell it, too. I just stood there for a little bit with the well. Then I left an offering. I had something in my hand. I left it there. Then I got up and continued to make my way through the garden. But something caused me to turn back. I did and one of the stones shifted - it was a large one. All these stones I\\u2019m describing are at least as tall as a person. When I turned back and looked, I walk toward this stone that was now upright. It\\u2019s Minerva. I sat there beside her for a little bit and wondered what cataclysmic event has caused all the gods and goddesses to be turned away. As I was mulling that through my mind, I was also happy that something had happened that was allowing them to turn back up - to return.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Recital\\u201d This is a really long dream, so I\\u2019m going to summarize some of the parts. It opens up and I\\u2019m at a wedding dance - a wedding celebration where people are dancing. There\\u2019s log tables with people sitting at them and food. The point of this part of it is I\\u2019m surrounded by people I do not want to be surrounded by. I love dancing but i can\\u2019t find anybody I want to dance with. And the people at this wedding are people I don\\u2019t want to share a meal with, so it\\u2019s not very much fun. The scene immediately shifts and I\\u2019m in a farmhouse in a completely different era. I'm participating in making and preserving food. So various people are doing various things. There\\u2019s some people who are actually churning butter. There are people that are milking cows and bringing the milk in pails to the people that are churning the butter. I am aware that there\\u2019s a smokehouse and there\\u2019s people building the fires and curing and smoking meats. It's outside though. Both of these are outside - the smokehouse is further away. Of course the cows are further away than that. The churning butter is closer to the house and I\\u2019m actually in the farmhouse. I\\u2019m in the kitchen. I\\u2019ve been chopping and making what appears to be kimchi which is odd given the historical setting. I\\u2019m putting it all in mason jars and sealing them. I can still smell the aroma of boiling vinegar in my nose. When I finish this, I turn around and Omar is there again. He\\u2019s distanced from me again, so he doesn\\u2019t really know me. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s Omar\\u2019s body but not his spirit in it. He sort of doesn\\u2019t know who I am. He tells me that he\\u2019s been aging Scotch. He tells me what he did with it. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did it work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Then the time speeds up and all of a sudden it\\u2019s today\\u2019s time and I have the two kids that I have. I\\u2019m telling Omar that I have to leave to take my son to his dance lesson. I ask him if he wants to come. He says, no he can\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m disappointed, but I have to go. I leave to go out the farmhouse door. This other guy that used to be a neighborhood thief hops in the car - in the backseat - as I\\u2019m leaving. I end up driving him to Brantford where he gets out and takes off somewhere. So I\\u2019ve picked up both my kids. I\\u2019m taking them to the dance lesson. There\\u2019s been some fiddling around and delays. When I was trying to get in the car, I was trying to get this thief out of it, and I think I\\u2019ve barely made it in time. I think the lesson is an hour, but as it turns out, it\\u2019s only a half hour and as soon as we get there, it\\u2019s over. So I take my kids back into the car and my son\\u2019s dad is in the backseat. He gets out and checks the oil level in the trunk and he\\u2019s spilling it everywhere. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I didn\\u2019t even want you to do that because I\\u2019m in a hurry again. Now why is he here delaying me?\\u201d Then he disappears and I\\u2019m immediately back in the parking lot of hte dance lesson building again. Time just skipped to another day. So I\\u2019m taking my kids back in and we're on time this time. I walk them into the recital hall. My son is acting in it and my daughter is dancing. I\\u2019m sitting up really close to him and I realize that he\\u2019s got different makeup on and he\\u2019s got an elaborate costume. He\\u2019s acting like an old man. He\\u2019s supposed to be chauffeuring another person from the play. I\\u2019m astonished at what a good job he\\u2019s doing with the acting right down to the smallest movements of his body. The rehearsal is finished and both my kids are given parts, none of which they\\u2019ve auditioned for, but they\\u2019re lead roles and neither one of my kids are lead-role people. They accept them graciously. They\\u2019re supposed to walk up onto the stage - each kid has done this - stand there to wait to be bestowed some kind of role and then curtsy and bow and exit out the other side of the stage and come back to their seats. So they\\u2019ve done this. When they get to their seats, they say, \\u201cOh no, Mom, I didn\\u2019t want these and I don\\u2019t want to be the lead role\\u201d and blah blah blah. Then I tell them, \\u201cWell, you should say something.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cNobody ever complains. They just take the roles. We don\\u2019t want to be the first ones to complain.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, if you don't want to do it, speak up. Maybe you could just ask if you can speak to them separately.\\u201d So my daughter approaches the head dance role person and I can\\u2019t hear what they\\u2019re saying, but they\\u2019re speaking. A moment later this head person says that my kids have something to say. They\\u2019ve set up this thing - like a platform. They wheel it onto the stage. It's long and skinny, about 4 feet long and about a foot wide. It\\u2019s on wheels and it\\u2019s got a railing around it, only on three sides, though. So they enter it from the back where there\\u2019s no railing. They have to stand in this and the dance role person makes them announce what they have asked to say. So it almost feels like a humiliation, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a humiliation or an honoring as they\\u2019ve put them in this railing thing and wheeled them onto the stage. They say, \\u201dUm, we don\\u2019t want these roles. Thank you very much, but we graciously decline these roles.\\u201d Then the audience starts clapping. They don\\u2019t look upset, so I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cPhew, oh look at them. I\\u2019m glad that they have been true to themselves.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Rose Farm\\u201d This dream begins in the house where I grew up. I\\u2019m in the kitchen waiting for a phone call. Some man is in the basement and he\\u2019s making something and periodically he comes upstairs. He\\u2019s wearing a toolbelt, he has a saw and he grabs some nails that are in a box on top of the fridge and goes back down with them. So, each time he trucks up and down the stairs, I\\u2019m aware that he has not finished making what he\\u2019s making down there. There\\u2019s a special delivery that comes to the front door. I answer it and bring it back to the table to open. It\\u2019s a package that was sent by a woman named Maureen that composes aerobics classes for GoodLife Fitness in Canada. It says I\\u2019m sorry for your loss and open it up and it\\u2019s this choreography for an aerobics class. However, it\\u2019s just the musical score. There\\u2019s no direction of what to put with it. There\\u2019s another person in the kitchen now and she\\u2019s someone that teaches this class. I show her the score and say, \\u201cUm, this is a nice gesture but how useful is it without the steps? There\\u2019s no choreography. It's only the music.\\u201d She looks at it with me and says, \\u201cHmmm,\\u201d and starts to listen to it and see if she can put steps to it. She gives up and says, \\u201cthis is impossible.\\u201d She sits down and then I look at it again. I realize that the beat is in things you can do in 8 and if you take 5 steps to the front, 1 to the side, 1 to the back and go back to where you started it does equal 8. So I\\u2019m starting to try to figure this out and then the phone rings. It\\u2019s Maureen from Good Life and she\\u2019s in a peppy aerobics instructor voice, \\u201cHi, this is Maureen! Did you get my package?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, I did, but I\\u2019m not quite sure what to do with it seeing there\\u2019s no choreography.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh well, there\\u2019s a word for that.\\u201d And I reply back, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s Word!\\u201d as a rapper would say it. There\\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone and she\\u2019s somewhat offended. The conversation ends. I go back into the kitchen, fully prepared to keep trying to figure this out for myself when the carpenter has completed this small box. He gives it to me and says, \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d As soon as I take the box in my hand, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m on this old farm. The farm has a sign in front of it and it\\u2019s called The Rose Farm. There\\u2019s a pump so you can pump the water up out of the ground. Everything is made of granite, which is a rock, and it\\u2019s faded pink. It really breathes history. The farm is strangely quiet, it\\u2019s almost like a museum. There\\u2019s no real activity going on in it. I go inside the farmhouse and there\\u2019s an old woman sitting there. My cat is with me. I say to her, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought something to comfort you.\\u201d I set the box down on the table. She\\u2019s sad. She looks up. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought my cat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think mine only has about an hour left.\\u201d Rather than seeing where her cat is lying, I see it as a vision in front of my eyes and it\\u2019s kind of suspended between the ground and the ceiling. The cat looks old - it looks like a 25 year old cat. Its fur is matted and its skin is emaciated away from its bones. The joints are big and round like arthritic. My cat is a lot younger, it\\u2019s black. It comes with me into the kitchen and my cat sits down beside me. We both wait there with her. Then I look at the wooden box I\\u2019ve set on the table and then I realize that it\\u2019s a coffin for her cat and she says, \\u201cThank you, I\\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here.\\u201d She takes the coffin and goes into the room and doesn't come back - neither one of them. And then my cat and I sit in the kitchen. I\\u2019m patting my cat and then the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cLima\\u201d This dream starts as though I\\u2019m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There\\u2019s a function, so it\\u2019s quite crowded and there\\u2019s a lot of people, most of whom I don\\u2019t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There\\u2019s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there\\u2019s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it\\u2019s over and it\\u2019s been over for some time. He\\u2019s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I\\u2019m reading the letter, it\\u2019s two pages long and there\\u2019s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, \\u201cDid he say anything to you personally?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just news.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m reading it again. There\\u2019s a story about his cat named Lima. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, what\\u2019s happened to him?\\u201d because he has two of them and he\\u2019s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I\\u2019m reading that the cat is missing. He\\u2019s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that\\u2019s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he\\u2019s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I\\u2019m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what\\u2019s in the letter like he knows what\\u2019s in the letter and he\\u2019s going off about what\\u2019s in the letter. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what\\u2019s in here.\\u201d Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I\\u2019m over in the UK, which is a trip I\\u2019ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I\\u2019m over there. So now I\\u2019m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I\\u2019m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I\\u2019m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I\\u2019m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There\\u2019s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it\\u2019s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend\\u2019s flat and knock on the door. It\\u2019s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It\\u2019s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it\\u2019s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he\\u2019s asking me how my trip was. I\\u2019m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, \\u201cYes, one of my daughters is here.\\u201d Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.\\u201d That\\u2019s all he says. I know from that remark that she\\u2019s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she\\u2019s with some of her friends. They\\u2019re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she\\u2019s changed it to Grassy. I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.\\u201d She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, \\u201cIt was nice to see you.\\u201d I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I\\u2019m talking to my artist friend. I say, \\u201cOh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can\\u2019t keep up with it.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019ve each got some of you in them.\\u201d He kind of laughs and I ask him if he\\u2019s found his cat. He says, \\u201cNo, not yet.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, I saw the cat.\\u201d And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, \\u201cHmm, let\\u2019s just go check that out.\\u201d We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cWhose Room Will Be Whose?\\u201d In my dream last night, I am part of a family that\\u2019s moving in with another family. I guess there are parents in the dream because I\\u2019m a teenager, but we never see the parents that belong to us. So, the family that lived there before we lived there still have some of their stuff in some of the rooms. We are going through the whole house deciding whose room will be whose. There's two boys in the other family we're going to be blended with. I have at least one sister, although it\\u2019s never quite clear the extent of our family because there\\u2019s more bodies in that house looking at rooms than just two boys and two girls. The house was originally an older house and the family before us added on other things and made it into a very big house. So in the kitchen, which I\\u2019m thinking the original one would have actually been quite beautiful - we go upstairs and then there\\u2019s a landing. The stairs open up with three stairs that go to one side and three stairs that go straight and three stairs that go to the other side. So the original kitchen would have been three sides and then open on the fourth side. But now there\\u2019s two rooms that go off - one straight ahead and one to the side, so there\\u2019s been two walls that have been put up. Now the kitchen is very tiny. It\\u2019s long. There\\u2019s a counter, a sink, a stove and some cupboards above that. One room that the family before us has put up a wall so there\\u2019s no doorway left, so you have to turn your body sideways to get in. It looks like the father of the previous family has made it into a computer room, but what blows my hair back when I walk into the room sideways is the number of intricacies of all these different parts and different computers. There\\u2019s 4 monitors and all these tools and it\\u2019s like he builds computers. There\\u2019s stuff stashed literally everywhere from floor to ceiling. Then somebody from the other family is in there and I'm surprised because I didn\\u2019t realize they had this other kid, but she\\u2019s sitting and she\\u2019s involved with something that goes on with the computer screen. There\\u2019s what appears to be two of her friends standing around watching her do this. She makes this one comment to me when I\\u2019m in there: The dad has a Swedish computer and it\\u2019s hard to find anything else that fits with all these cords and parts and pieces. So I leave back out that room and think, \\u201cWell that definitely can\\u2019t be my room.\\u201d I go into the next one - it\\u2019s really small, it only has a single bed in it and a tiny dresser. The walls are poured concrete. I turn around, go back down the stairs, and go on to the lower level which has a bathroom in it and a laundry room and these three enormous bedrooms. As I go in there, I see one that\\u2019s long enough that I could set up my craft table and my yoga mat. There\\u2019s all kinds of things I can do in that room with the space because it fits more than just the bed and the dresser. But as I\\u2019m walking toward it, the older boy from the family we\\u2019re blending with says, \\u201cThis is my room.\\u201d Then the other room seems to go to the other boy, which leaves one more room that\\u2019s only 3 walls and is exposed on the third side, so I don\\u2019t want that room. Then as I turn around, the space that\\u2019s between the bottom of the stairs and where the rooms branch off to is a really, really big landing and it\\u2019s got some more of these intricate parts and pieces and cubby holes and things that are just filled with stuff that has belonged to the family before us. I\\u2019m just looking at it, fascinated with all these parts and the way they\\u2019re organized - highly organized. In fact, one drawer, I pull it out and there\\u2019s tools that are organized in chronology of increments that must be no more than 1mm apart. Apparently, they\\u2019re for the Swedish computer. So nobody else\\u2019s computers or electronics or things that you plug in are fitting in this house, so there\\u2019s this kerfuffle about finding other parts that are compatible. While I\\u2019m looking at all this, there\\u2019s this other girl that I didn\\u2019t realize the family had and she indicates the shelves that are currently full of tools and things: \\u201cThis Is where I\\u2019m going to put my gun collection.\\u201d There\\u2019s nowhere for me to put anything between the family\\u2019s stuff that is already there and this other extended family we\\u2019re blending with that\\u2019s taking all the rooms. There's nowhere for me to be here. Then I go into the washroom and decide I\\u2019m going to have a bath. While I\\u2019m in the bathroom, there's people coming and knocking on the door and needing their stuff. That\\u2019s where the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Attached Pool\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m in a place that\\u2019s very rocky. It looks like Niagara's escarpment and the houses built in that area. The escarpment commission won\\u2019t let you change the natural formation of the land in order to build there, so houses are very expensive and you have to go around the rocks with your architecture. So I\\u2019m with a couple of other people and they are judgemental about the houses built here and mocking the other people's wealth and ignorantly gossiping about the style of architecture to the extent that they\\u2019re just saying it\\u2019s stupid. I realize as I\\u2019m walking with this crowd of people and picking up on the remarks they're making that I know one of the people that lives in these houses. It\\u2019s a woman I taught a teacher training and she\\u2019s a nice lady, but her personality is very irritating. I stand still for a moment and the group of people walking behind me walk past. I\\u2019m gazing at the house they\\u2019re talking about and I see this woman come out of it. I think, \\u201cOh, this is her house.\\u201d They\\u2019ve built a change room for their pool and it\\u2019s like a giant treehouse. It\\u2019s unfinished with just dry-wall, but I can see her family coming out of it and they\\u2019re changed and ready for the pool. I walk a little closer to look at the pool that everyone was making fun of. The idea is genius. It\\u2019s like a large long narrow plexiglass tank that\\u2019s obviously been made to fit into the area between the rocks. It\\u2019s attached to the foundation of their house on one side and the rocks on the other side and it\\u2019s clear, so whatever nature is around it, is seen through the pool. So it\\u2019s almost camouflaged - you don\\u2019t notice it right away. It\\u2019s not finished, however, and there's no water in it. She sees me standing there and invites me in. Part of me thinks, \\u201cOh no,\\u201d because she has an annoying personality, and the other part of me is curious how they have done and structured this house. I\\u2019m taken by the architecture. I can\\u2019t really get out of it anyway without being rude, so I accept the invitation. I think, well I\\u2019ll just come in and have tea with them, I don\\u2019t have to stay long. So I do. Their house is quite busy. Her husband is expecting this business associate to come in and she\\u2019s running around doing stuff. I\\u2019m not sure what she\\u2019s doing, she\\u2019s just really busy. She leaves me sitting at the kitchen table with no tea. I'm just sitting there and this other business associate comes in. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, he\\u2019s getting annoyed that the husband is late.\\u201d So, I offer the business associate tea to keep him happy. I have a conversation with the business associate that\\u2019s very, very interesting (but I forgot it as soon as I woke up). As I\\u2019m offering him tea, he says that he likes chai, but he doesn\\u2019t normally order it because people don\\u2019t know how to make it. I suggest the ingredients I know of - \\u201cWhat about these? What about ginger root?\\u201d and he nods. And I say, \\u201cPeppercorns?\\u201d and he nods. And I say, \\u201cCinnamon?\\u201d and he nods. \\u201cCardamom seed?\\u201d More nodding. \\u201cWhole cloves?\\u201d Nodding. I say, \\u201cHow does that sound?\\u201d I can see them over on the counter. He says, \\u201cYes that would be a good idea.\\u201d So I boil the water and while we\\u2019re waiting, the woman comes back and says, \\u201cOh good, you\\u2019ve started it. I just didn\\u2019t have time. Go over there and get some grapes.\\u201d So I wash those and offer them to the business associate. She runs off again and I sit there and continue to have a conversation with this business associate. While we\\u2019re talking, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m in a kind of sailboat and I\\u2019m in a race. It\\u2019s already going on and we\\u2019ve turned around. Part of the race is to take a hard bank to the starboard and keep doing it until you\\u2019ve done this quick 360 turn and pick up the line of something else you\\u2019re supposed to drag. My partner turns the boat and I reach out and I\\u2019ve got the rope. We\\u2019re dragging this thing. Then immediately I\\u2019m in the sky and I\\u2019m looking down on the ship and there\\u2019s this small child in one of the boats with a suncover pulled right over and a towel over its head. Then I think, \\u201cOh, that's a good idea for sleeping on a boat.\\u201d Then we\\u2019re on the boat again and the race is over. We\\u2019re coasting into a dock, getting off, and the company I\\u2019m with say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go get something to eat.\\u201d And we\\u2019re in Mexico. We just start walking into town. The ground is hard packed sand from so many people\\u2019s feet walking over it for hundreds of years. It's still warm from the sun. It\\u2019s this beautiful reddish brown terracotta color. There\\u2019s no ugly black asphalt and I\\u2019m grateful for that feeling under my feet. As we walk in, there\\u2019s many hastily thrown together pubs made of wood. It\\u2019s the kind of wood you see Mexican furniture made out of - I don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s called. It\\u2019s painted bright colors. We go into one pub, sit down, and there\\u2019s nothing on the menu I can eat. It\\u2019s all cheese and beef and wheat. I ask if they have chicken. The woman serving us says, \\u201cI can get one.\\u201d And there\\u2019s these chickens running through the restaurant and she picks one of them up and cuts its head off. But the knife isn\\u2019t sharp and it takes three heaves to get it through. I`m horrified. Then I leave the table. I guess I can\\u2019t stand this in the dream. I walk over to the bar and I think maybe I\\u2019ll just get a beer and that will fill my stomach. So I order one. The woman brings it to me and I notice she's got a gigantic bag of laundry. I think I\\u2019ll just help her fold it. I start folding and there\\u2019s 5 pairs of tiny pants the same size, and suddenly in my vision I see she has quintuplets she\\u2019s looking after and trying to make money in the bar. This is just part of life. The customers sitting at the bar all know her. I fold the clothes and put them back in the garbage bag behind the counter where I found them. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Concert\\u201d The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I\\u2019m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don\\u2019t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It\\u2019s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I\\u2019m waiting for my turn, there\\u2019s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It\\u2019s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it\\u2019s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don\\u2019t question this in the dream - it\\u2019s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I\\u2019m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I\\u2019m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I\\u2019m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I\\u2019m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven\\u2019t put them in the bank and they aren\\u2019t very safe where they are rolled up and put in this ceramic vase. So it sparks my memories. I put them back in the vase. It\\u2019s too late to go to the bank tonight, but I will go tomorrow. Then I go back downstairs. Omar and his friend Al and a girl he\\u2019s taking with him have arrived and they\\u2019re in the living room. We are happy to see each other. I go down and am talking to them for a while. I see what he\\u2019s wearing and tell him I\\u2019m going to get changed. I go back upstairs and someone is in the shower. I find a rolled up wad of money on the floor. I turn around and Omar is behind me. I say, \\u201cIs this yours?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Oh, there\\u2019s so many people in this house and we don\\u2019t know all of them. Don\\u2019t go downstairs and just say, \\u2018whose wad of money is this?\\u2019\\u201d I say, \\u201cI won\\u2019t. I\\u2019m going to go put it in my room and I\\u2019ll find a way to make it known to someone so they know their money is missing.\\u201d I go back into my room and I change. I pick out a black mini skirt with gold thread around the hem. I think it\\u2019s very pretty and sparkly. I choose a white blouse and a jacket that goes overtop just a few inches above the hem of the skirt. I put on my black tights and a pair of bulky socks and boots that look really nice. Then I go downstairs and Omar tells me I look very nice. But I turn and Al\\u2019s friend (I don\\u2019t know her name) is wearing the same thing I am. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s really odd. That wasn\\u2019t what she was wearing when I went up the stairs.\\u201d I look over at Omar and he\\u2019s laughing. I shrug it off and I say to everyone in the room, \\u201cHow much money is everyone bringing?\\u201d So I\\u2019m trying to get them to look in their wallets. The person whose money it is that\\u2019s missing will realize it\\u2019s lost and I can return the money to whoever it is. But they all check their wallets and they say different amounts. I say, \\u201cOkay, well I\\u2019m going to go upstairs and get my money.\\u201d While I\\u2019m going upstairs, the person is still in the shower and I realize it\\u2019s my nephew, Jared. I wonder if the money belongs to him. I put the wad of money in the same ceramic vase as the other checks that I need to deposit in the bank. Then I look through my own drawers and I find my wallet. I take out 2 twenties and put them in the little clutch that I\\u2019ve decided to take with me for the night. I go back downstairs again. Someone else is in the living room and she\\u2019s showing Omar this fabric and saying, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this beautiful? It would make a nice skirt.\\u201d I look and say, \\u201cOh yes, it is.\\u201d This is all gold and if you look closely, the gold thread has created patterns of flowers and it\\u2019s shimmering. This gold is really quite beautiful. Then suddenly, it\\u2019s not fabric anymore. It is a skirt - a longer skirt. She says, \\u201cThis skirt costs $2,000 and people pay that for it and only wear it once. Within a couple of weeks it\\u2019s in a punk rock thrift store and that\\u2019s where I found it. This would look really nice on you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWow, you\\u2019re giving it to me?!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThank you so much!\\u201d I was thinking maybe I\\u2019ll change into it for tonight and then decide not to because it\\u2019s a long skirt and I want to save it for another time. I ask her if she would like some money for it. She hesitates and doesn\\u2019t answer and I\\u2019m thinking I could give her another twenty. I\\u2019m waiting and waiting, but she doesn\\u2019t answer me, so I thank her graciously. I go back upstairs and I put it in my room. I look into my wallet and I get out another $20 just in case to give to her. So I go back downstairs and by this time, I\\u2019m becoming conscious that it feels like it's the same time and all these activities are happening and we still haven\\u2019t left for the concert. So I say to everyone, \\u201cShouldn\\u2019t we be leaving?\\u201d They say, \\u201cYes, it starts really soon.\\u201d I look out the door and I see that someone else is coming in and they need to get ready for the concert. Right at that time, there\\u2019s a sliver in the time-space continuum and I\\u2019m at work. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to get back to meet everyone for the concert.\\u201d Then when I'm thinking that, that same time frame fabric opens up and I\\u2019m back in the house. I think, \\u201cOh good, everyone is still here.\\u201d But then we\\u2019re waiting for someone else to get ready. She comes back downstairs and she\\u2019s wearing that shimmering gold skirt. I think, \\u201cWow, this is really odd.\\u201d But again I just shrug it off and I\\u2019m trying to get everyone to go. I say, \\u201cWe should call for a cab.\\u201d But Omar\\u2019s friend is driving. I tell them there isn\\u2019t enough room for everyone in the one car. Then suddenly they have other rides and we get in the car and go. We arrive at the concert hall and I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s general admission. We find a place to stand on the floor. I feel like I\\u2019m in the masonic temple or the music hall. I decide it\\u2019s the music hall. It\\u2019s quite dark. The band is playing but there\\u2019s no lights on the stage or upstairs on the balcony. But I recognize the structure and I think, \\u201cOh I know where we are.\\u201d Then we start dancing as though the concert is just a background. It\\u2019s good. Omar and I are dancing and enjoying ourselves. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I\\u2019m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There\\u2019s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I\\u2019m packing bags. There\\u2019s a reason, although I don\\u2019t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I\\u2019m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing that?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, I have to do this anyway.\\u201d Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: \\u201cHow old is that child?\\u201d I look down in puzzlement and see that she\\u2019s only five. I think, \\u201cHow did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.\\u201d I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It\\u2019s not safe.\\u201d So, I tell him I\\u2019ve changed my mind. Then I\\u2019m uncertain what to do. Now I\\u2019m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we\\u2019re about to go to. I tell her that it\\u2019s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She\\u2019s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I\\u2019m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It\\u2019s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there\\u2019s one washroom to the left - it\\u2019s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There\\u2019s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we\\u2019re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I\\u2019m able to hear the one person I know - he\\u2019s an author - that he\\u2019s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he\\u2019s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we\\u2019re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I\\u2019m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I\\u2019m getting the feeling that there\\u2019s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don\\u2019t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there\\u2019s two of them - they\\u2019re also talking in hushed tones. I\\u2019m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I\\u2019ve come to this house for and it\\u2019s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn\\u2019t just an idea for a book, it\\u2019s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, \\u201cDo you recognize that?\\u201d I said yes. He says, \\u201cAfter this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.\\u201d So I agree. Then someone comes in that\\u2019s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he\\u2019s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he\\u2019s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s planning this way to get out that\\u2019s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that\\u2019s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I\\u2019m not really listening. I\\u2019m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who\\u2019s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that\\u2019s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat are they up to?\\u201d So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It\\u2019s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there\\u2019s urine all over the seat and it\\u2019s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s urine all over it. There\\u2019s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she\\u2019s still five and as I\\u2019m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I\\u2019ve been talking to and he\\u2019s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he\\u2019s drying it with another towel. He\\u2019s just had a shower. So he\\u2019s involved in what he\\u2019s doing. There\\u2019s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I\\u2019ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I\\u2019ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGoop Eye\\u201d I am in my house and trying to teach my YTT (yoga teacher training). It\\u2019s not the students that I have in it in real life. It\\u2019s different ones that I don\\u2019t recognize. One of them keeps coming with her husband and he drives her there and then waits in another room while we do the TT and then drives her back home. He doesn't go home in between. He\\u2019s old - probably 75 kind of old, and he has a very slow kapha like nature to him and he\\u2019s a genuinely nice man. I notice after the first couple of days that one of his eyes - his right eye - is swollen. I ask about it and say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong with your eye? Do you need some help for that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Then the next day when they arrive, it\\u2019s even more swollen. I\\u2019m questioning him and asking him - should he not go and see someone about his eye. Again he says, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Then the next day he comes back and it\\u2019s puffy and there\\u2019s this white goopy stuff growing around it and it\\u2019s swollen to the extent that there\\u2019s only a little tiny space between the upper and lower eyelid. I ask him if he can see out of his eye and he says no. Then I say, \\u201cCan I get a little better look at it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s pretty serious if you can\\u2019t see out of your eye.\\u201d As I get closer, now I can see in his eye. As I look into his eyeball, I see that there\\u2019s globules of this white stuff on the surface of his eye. I describe this to him and tell him what I see. He says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s related to this food that I eat.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, shouldn\\u2019t you get that looked at because it\\u2019s getting worse?\\u201d Then I realize I have to make a decision because he\\u2019s in denial and refusing to get help for his eye and now it\\u2019s visibly got gook on it. I\\u2019m afraid that he might be infecting my group of students. So I tell them that unless he gets the medical attention for his eye, they cannot come back to the YTT. But I\\u2019m also worried that we all might already be infected. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cWooden Ship\\u201d In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It\\u2019s between 40 and 60 feet long. It\\u2019s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he\\u2019s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it\\u2019s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It\\u2019s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It\\u2019s got debris filtered from the water as it\\u2019s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There\\u2019s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I\\u2019m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven\\u2019t gone all the way out into the body of water. We\\u2019re still going through the channel. I\\u2019m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: \\u201cRandy, it\\u2019s too shallow here, we\\u2019ll never make it through! We\\u2019re going to run aground!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, no, we\\u2019ll be fine. I\\u2019ve done this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s maneuvering the ship and I\\u2019m positive it\\u2019s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you\\u2019re going to scrape your keel. You\\u2019re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don\\u2019t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the ship just didn't run aground.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s because it has no keel.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! So how are we staying balanced?\\u201d Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it\\u2019s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, \\u201cOh, that explains that.\\u201d The dream speeds through the day on the water like it\\u2019s just a minute and we\\u2019re coming back through this same channel. Now it\\u2019s time to tie up. I\\u2019m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that\\u2019s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I\\u2019m climbing up, I realize it\\u2019s not attached to the wall and it\\u2019s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn\\u2019t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I\\u2019m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it\\u2019s a platform, like walking the plank. It\\u2019s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He\\u2019s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I\\u2019m okay. Now I\\u2019m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I\\u2019m standing there talking to him saying, \\u201cHow is this boat balanced without a keel?\\u201d He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it\\u2019s made of wood so it must be light plus it\\u2019s buoyant. There\\u2019s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It\\u2019s actually a hole. I\\u2019m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn\\u2019t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s Crime in Cafes\\u201d It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don\\u2019t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They\\u2019re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don\\u2019t even know how deep it goes. So there\\u2019s a self-serve area at one end - that\\u2019s the end that goes on and on and I don\\u2019t know how deep it goes. At the other end that\\u2019s open, it has long tables where you can take what you\\u2019ve selected and eat there with people. It\\u2019s packed. So, the dream opens and I\\u2019m sitting at a table. I\\u2019m not eating though. I\\u2019m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She\\u2019s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it\\u2019s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we\\u2019re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There\\u2019s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there\\u2019s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it\\u2019s finished, we go to the room next door. There\\u2019s another teacher in there that we\\u2019re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he\\u2019s trying to undermine the first teacher. We\\u2019ve gotten our lunch out and we\\u2019re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we\\u2019re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We\\u2019re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she\\u2019s still there. We share this information with her. She\\u2019s grateful. We tell her that we\\u2019ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you here at the same time the next day.\\u201d So while I\\u2019m lining up to go and get food, first there\\u2019s this thing that happens with gum. There\\u2019s a direction by the cashier - it\\u2019s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, \\u201cWhy are they doing this? I don\\u2019t even want all this gum.\\u201d So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! $50 for something I don\\u2019t even want.\\u201d However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I\\u2019m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don\\u2019t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I\\u2019m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he\\u2019s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no! That\\u2019s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!\\u201d He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn\\u2019t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I\\u2019ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don\\u2019t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There\\u2019s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It\\u2019s crowded and it\\u2019s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There\\u2019s people walking in the street. It\\u2019s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I\\u2019m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what\\u2019s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He\\u2019s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They\\u2019re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don\\u2019t know if they've purchased them or if he\\u2019s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what\\u2019s in the bag. They open it up and there\\u2019s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We\\u2019re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.\\u201d They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He\\u2019s giving it away and he\\u2019s giving it to children. He\\u2019s helping people. I think, \\u201cOh! Well he\\u2019s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they\\u2019re looking for this person?\\u201d So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn\\u2019t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren\\u2019t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I\\u2019m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she\\u2019s there. She\\u2019s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50\\u2019s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it\\u2019s got a rounded collar and she\\u2019s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s dressed up really nicely. She\\u2019s in her good dress.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t see me. In fact, we don\\u2019t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she\\u2019s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I\\u2019m supposed to have, knowing that I can\\u2019t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she\\u2019s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I\\u2019d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can\\u2019t really. I wonder if she\\u2019s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He\\u2019s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He\\u2019s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cyborg in Me\\u201d I entered my dream space as a cyborg. There was no one else in it. I felt nothing. There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn\\u2019t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that\\u2019s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That\\u2019s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn\\u2019t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Lecture Hall\\u201d The dream begins with me leaving the house I live in. I\\u2019m going to walk to a lecture. I have a backpack on. I\\u2019m wearing a raincoat. It\\u2019s quite a hike, but that\\u2019s not unusual for me. I like to walk. The walk takes about an hour. It\\u2019s just straight up a street, block after block, tree lined and very pretty. It\\u2019s a small town. It\\u2019s like walking up Cathedral Avenue in BC with huge trees that form an umbrella - they reach toward each other overtop. So I don\\u2019t even feel the rain. It\\u2019s raining out, but I\\u2019m not feeling it on my body or my face. I\\u2019m not getting wet. I arrive at the place where the lecture is and it\\u2019s a house. I realize that it\\u2019s the house of my professor, M.M. So, I walk up to the side and knock on the door and she answers it. The door opens out into her kitchen. She\\u2019s happy to see me, though we don\\u2019t hug. We stand about 6 feet apart, respecting social distancing. There's several other people in the kitchen and they're all in some kind of process of removing outer clothing and hanging it up on hooks. Then we go down the hall from the kitchen, into an enormous university style lecture hall where there\\u2019s theatre seats and a stage. At this point, M.M. disappears and I realize that the lecture is not on the psychology topic I thought it was on, but it\\u2019s two men who are standing there and they\\u2019re kind of counting the number of people that they have. I can overhear their conversation. They\\u2019re saying that they thought there\\u2019d be more than this. But, \\u201cthis is a good turnout anyway and let\\u2019s hope we can sell it.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh, man, I\\u2019m not here to buy anything,\\u201d and I\\u2019m disappointed. So the two men walk down the aisle towards the stage. They don\\u2019t even mount the stage yet, when people start leaving. Then the one man stands to the side and the other one gets up and stands behind the podium and he begins to talk but doesn\\u2019t say anything. More and more people are leaving until there\\u2019s only 3 or 4 people left. Then he ceases the talk and says, \\u201cWell I guess that was a bomb.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh good,\\u201d because I wanted to leave, too, but there were people on either side of me and I didn\\u2019t want to make a big deal about getting them to get up so I could leave. But they were leaving, so I was glad. So now I have to get my backpack and everything again. But during this moment, there\\u2019s this crowd by the door and I see M.M. again. I go up to talk to her. She\\u2019s got a man standing fairly close to her. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m so glad to see you. It\\u2019s been a long time. I can\\u2019t give you a hug, but I can dance with you.\\u201d So she reaches her arms out and we interlace fingers. It\\u2019s the dance where the one partner spins the other partner a half turn and your hands stay clasped with your arms over your head and then the arms straighten, you move away from each other, hands stay clasped, then the next time you go all the way in so the arms are crossed in front of you, you take a few steps forward and a few steps back, you do the half turn again so your arms become uncrossed but still stay laced at the fingers. She does this a couple of times with me. During one of the times when we\\u2019re shoulder to shoulder, I say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not okay to hug, but this is okay?\\u201d She says, \\u201ci don\\u2019t know!\\u201d Then we do the step one more time. The next time we\\u2019ve lengthened arms, she releases my fingers and steps back. She introduces me to the man, but doesn\\u2019t say his name. She just says, \\u201cthis is my friend.\\u201d We give each other the shoulder distance nod in recognition. I say, \\u201cThis is your house?! I\\u2019m surprised that you\\u2019ve moved.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I had to downsize and I have a tenant that lives upstairs. He\\u2019s a really nice man. Just go out onto the veranda and check it out.\\u201d So I do. I open the other door, walk up the steps, look at the door outside, look at the architecture a little bit, and come back down. I\\u2019m thinking I can\\u2019t believe this opens up into a lecture hall, but I don\\u2019t comment on the size of that. Then I just look around the kitchen a little bit, make some other comments about the design and the architecture. I\\u2019m admiring it. They\\u2019re all complimentary. Then, she says, \\u201cWell, it was nice to see you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes,\\u201d and tell her I need to go before it starts raining harder. So I go back into the lecture hall. Now my coat is on a coat rack - one of the tall ones that has a hook on either side and stands like a post. I begin to arrange my things. But now I\\u2019ve got two pillows and a yoga mat that I have to roll up and arrange with the backpack. So I put my raincoat on and then I roll the yoga mat up. The yoga mat is really thick and has clips and ties on it. I roll it up tight and squeeze it so the air goes out and it rolls up into this little stick. Then I wrap the clips around it, hook them and intertwine the hooks against each other so it will stay really tight. So now that\\u2019s taken care of. I put it on the bottom of my backpack. Then I put my raincoat on and think, \\u201cWhat am I going to do with these two pillows?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019ve got two raincoats. So the second raincoat - I fold the arms up and the hood down and I roll it up really tight and I squeeze the air out of it. I manage to get that in my backpack. Now I\\u2019ve got these two pillows. I think, how am I going to do this? They won\\u2019t fit in the backpack. I don't want to carry them. I don\\u2019t want them to get wet because they\\u2019re down-filled. So I put one against my back and then it takes me ages to reach my arm around to find the loop of the backpack. While I\\u2019m doing this, the two men that were to have the presentation are starting to gather their things up, too. The one comments to me: \\u201cSure is taking you a long time to get your stuff on.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer him. I just continue getting my stuff on because I think he\\u2019s just stated the obvious and it doesn\\u2019t require a reply. Then I finally find the second loop to my backpack - I get it around, I pull it against my body so the air squishes out of that pillows and I think, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019ve done it.\\u201d Now I have to do this again. How am I going to slide this other pillow down? I consider asking the man that I just ignored if he can slide the pillow in between the back of the backpack and the other pillow. But I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. Then I see the tenant come down from M.M.\\u2019s apartment at the top floor of the house. So I go walking back up out of the lecture hall instead. M.M. is still there talking to some people who are continuing to exit. She says, \\u201cOh wait a minute! I want to introduce you to my tenant.\\u201d She calls him the Chinaman. I think, \\u201cWow, why doesn\\u2019t she give him a name?\\u201d He shakes my hand and I shake his. I say, \\u201cHow long have you been living here?\\u201d He says, \\u201cSixteen years.\\u201d I exclaim, \\u201cSixteen years?!\\u201d and I look at M.M. and say, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize when you said it was a couple of years that it had been that long.\\u201d This is only significant because I haven't realized it\\u2019s been that long since she\\u2019s moved there with a tenant and I have not seen her. We chat for a little bit. He seems like a nice man. I ask him if he will slide the pillow down in between the other pillow and the back of the backpack. He says, \\u201cSure no problem.\\u201d He does that. Then I say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m all packed up. I leave. I have my stuff. I go back out into the drizzling rainy day and start walking back down the avenue and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cMacro-Level Choices\\u201d This dream begins where I am part of this diagram, so I\\u2019m watching what feels like a macro-level perspective of different groups of people\\u2019s food choices. What I see with my eyes is a big bluish grey, but not a chart...it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m inside the chart. I realize I'm looking at patterns of people at an anthropological level from around the world and the choices that they make in food. I\\u2019m watching them like small dots. I\\u2019m wondering what this is. I look at them and study them for long enough. They\\u2019re moving. I see almost like an arc, a pendulum, that swings from the cluster of dots of choices they make, and I\\u2019m not even sure that they\\u2019re all food related - I don\\u2019t think they are. They\\u2019re clustering. Then one of the dots will swing out like a pendulum, then pause. It\\u2019s moved into this other category of things that they\\u2019ve learned. The learning is an evolutionary succession. In the dream, I seem to understand the macro-level implications of this without needing to know the exact words or categories of each choice. My thinking brain is in wonderment at realizing what all these small clusters of activity arrive at - like an aha! Then I move from realizing that some of them are food choices. The dreams shifts from a macro-level to what is happening right now on the earth. Then I arrive in a restaurant. I\\u2019m looking at people\\u2019s food choices. It starts at a table with a woman I haven\\u2019t seen in a long time - Margie is one of my daughter\\u2019s friend\\u2019s mothers. I haven\\u2019t seen her since my daughter was in Grade 8 because the kids ended up going to different high schools. Margie sits down and makes some kind of comment like, \\u201cI thought we were friends, but you never contacted.\\u201d I express surprise at this and say, \\u201cYes, I live over here now and work every evening as well as in the day. I don\\u2019t have time for that kind of thing.\\u201d She seems to feel amenable to that explanation and starts talking to me about her family. As she\\u2019s talking, this other young lad, maybe 17, is hovering around the table and moving things. He\\u2019s getting his backpack and he\\u2019s putting things in it. Then he slides into the role of server and is cleaning some of the plates away. Only Margie\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s plate is left. Now I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s some kind of older step brother and wonder if she has remarried since I knew her. But I look at the young man and he has some features that look like Margie\\u2019s husband. So now I\\u2019m wondering if this young man is maybe a child of the previous marriage of the husband, which means they could still be together and I\\u2019m just seeing this man grown up. Then the scene shifts from the table in a restaurant. I\\u2019m now in the kitchen in their house. People are packing up and clearing away dishes from the table, still. Margie has asked me if I\\u2019ll come over for tea. I agree to do this. My own son has somehow been invited to go back and forth from my house to hers, which is actually something she would do - organize families on this slightly macro-level as dinner is going on because she is an accountant. He\\u2019s now only 7 and he has a scooter. There's the question of how he will get his things from my house to hers on this scooter. I tell him to try it right now: \\u201cPut all the things you have with you in a bag and we\\u2019ll weigh it. Is it too heavy to swing from one handle of the scooter?\\u201d It is. It will pull him off balance a bit. So I say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we roll the bag and I\\u2019ll bungee cord it to the back of the scooter. No one uses that space anyway. Then it will keep the mechanics more balanced.\\u201d Margie says, \\u201cOh yes! That\\u2019s a really good idea!\\u201d My son is now on the road and he gives it a couple tries up and down and says, \\u201cYes, it works.\\u201d Now I'm back in the kitchen - in the thought of the kitchen. The dream is shifting me through thought patterns. The young man is now ready to go and he hasn\\u2019t said anything I ask him if he needs a ride because he seems to be hovering. I ask him how he\\u2019s going to move from Place A to Place B. He declines the ride. Now, the dream pattern shifts and I\\u2019m in a restaurant and serving tables, moving food from underneath the heat lamp where it\\u2019s cooked in the kitchen out to the tables - I\\u2019m coordinating that. It tells you where to go because it has the name of the server on the paper beside the food as well as the table number. So I just do this for a little bit. Then my shift is over and I\\u2019m sitting in the breakroom counting up money and adding that up when one of the cooks comes in from the kitchen and says, \\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\\u201d I realize I\\u2019m not on the schedule for next week and the rest of the staff seem to know this and are questioning why this has happened. Each person, there\\u2019s probably 5 or 6 people who come into contact with me and tell me they\\u2019re surprised by this, and that I was doing a new job, and they are sorry to see me go, and then some questions about how they\\u2019ll keep in touch with me. I\\u2019m wondering, thinking, \\u201cOh so it\\u2019s not just me not knowing why I\\u2019ve been let go.\\u201d I decide after all of this to go into the office to see if I can ask why. I\\u2019m looking for closure. The part of the administration that\\u2019s responsible for scheduling doesn\\u2019t know the answer to that question and evades me when I ask direct questions, but doesn\\u2019t seem hostile. There\\u2019s the energy of feeling that person doesn\\u2019t know why they\\u2019ve been requested to do that either. So, I leave, put everything in my pack, make sure I\\u2019ve left nothing behind, and say final goodbyes. And here\\u2019s this young man again from the other thought pattern - the guy that might possibly be Margie\\u2019s stepson. He\\u2019s leaving at the same time, but now he\\u2019s asking me if I need a ride. I say, \\u201cNo thank you. I\\u2019ve got a car in the parking lot.\\u201d So I walk out with my things and put them in the car. I notice he\\u2019s putting his things in a red car. When he leaves, it\\u2019s really noisy. Then I get in mine. Now there\\u2019s snow on the ground. I\\u2019m testing my brakes. The brakes aren\\u2019t where they should be. So I gear down to navigate my car out of the parking lot because I have to make a right hand turn. Gearing down works and gives me a little extra time to figure out where the brake pedal has been moved to. It\\u2019s weight over on the left in a really odd place, where the clutch would be. But I\\u2019ve got it now. I have to make another right hand turn. Suddenly there\\u2019s a bus. The whole left hand lane is stopped, so I go even further left to go around. It\\u2019s okay even though my tires don\\u2019t really have traction in the snow. Now I'm driving through a city. I start job hunting. I stop at a few restaurants on my way home after applying to three different restaurants. They all say they don\\u2019t need anyone. Now I\\u2019ve driven to the complete opposite end of town and am back in the house where I would meet Margie for tea.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arms Dealer\\u201d This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he\\u2019s not there to buy books. I realize I\\u2019m not in my own body because I see my arm and it\\u2019s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that\\u2019s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can\\u2019t see the other two names, but that\\u2019s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that\\u2019s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That\\u2019s the point I realize they\\u2019ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he\\u2019s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, \\u201cOkay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?\\u201d They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, \\u201cEh, shouldn\\u2019t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren\\u2019t we not supposed to jostle this material or there\\u2019s the danger of it exploding?\\u201d Man consciousness me says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d The part of my own consciousness that\\u2019s trapped in there says, \\u201cYou have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can\\u2019t have any cough. It\\u2019s not supposed to be jostled once.\\u201d I feel frustrated inside this guy\\u2019s consciousness. Then, he has a few things that he\\u2019s gathered and puts his arms around them and carries them. It feels like the way it would feel as though you were carrying two bags of groceries with loaves of bread in them with one tucked under each arm. I compare it to this. Then he walks up the alleyway and into his house. I notice that the house is really overcrowded and has toys and books and stuff everywhere - belonging to someone who never cleans up. Then he goes into the kitchen and the rack they use in restaurants for putting dishes on and then putting them through an autoclave machine - he sets three loaves of bread on the dish rack and puts them in the oven, but doesn\\u2019t turn it on yet. He\\u2019s still got this dry cough, and I think, \\u201cWow, isn\\u2019t this guy going to take care of that?\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t. Then he sits down at the table, ostensibly to wait while these things do whatever they have to do in the oven. Then the part of the man that\\u2019s my consciousness starts to take over and the man consciousness starts to go away. Now I\\u2019m me and I\\u2019m sitting there looking around at this mess and thinking, \\u201cUgh, I have to start cleaning this up.\\u201d Then across from the table, Omar appears. I tell him, \\u201cWhat is wrong with these people? Why is everybody in denial? There's so many other choices that people make. I don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d He nods his head and agrees, then asks me if it\\u2019s okay if he uses my bicycle from the garage. I say, \\u201cYeah, do you know which one it is?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I think so. It\\u2019s the one your ex-husband\\u2019s been using.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?! What are you talking about? Why would either one of you want to use my bicycle?\\u201d It\\u2019s got the two white bars that go down and purple - it looks like a girl\\u2019s bike. He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it looks like now.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat does it look like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, your husband modified it. It\\u2019s got a motorcycle seat on it. And he took out the hump in the middle, so you can sit upright on it.\\u201d I\\u2019m starting to get riled up because he never asked me if he could do that. Then I look back at Omar and say, \\u201cThis is the problem! He never respects my boundaries and he always does these things without asking first. Do you think it\\u2019s unreasonable that it upsets me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo that is a normal thing.\\u201d Then he makes reference to his ex-wife and he says, \\u201cEven in my marriage, we asked each other for permission.\\u201d Then he starts laughing and he takes a piece of paper and shows me - it\\u2019s written the way you would write out a script in a play with the one person\\u2019s name, then the colon and the line then the other person. There\\u2019s 10 lines of just one-liners. First it\\u2019s him and his ex-wife, him and his ex-wife, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, all the way down. Then one of them throws their hands up in exasperation and says: \\u201cOkay fine!\\u201d So he just hands it to me and I read this. Then he\\u2019s laughing and says, \\u201cWell at least it\\u2019s agreement.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m laughing, too, and say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s better than just taking it without asking, then modifying, then just walking away again, leaving it in the modified form so I can\\u2019t use it anymore.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cAlright, well I have to go to work.\\u201d So I follow him down the hallway. As I\\u2019m passing through the kitchen, I look at the store and think, \\u201cWhy is it at 77 degrees Celsius?!\\u201d I look with alarm and think, \\u201cOh yeah, that\\u2019s from the man consciousness body.\\u201d I see the three loaves of bread in there and they are starting to disintegrate with the heat. It\\u2019s vaporizing the plastic bags, and I think, \\u201cOh, isn\\u2019t that going to melt and cause some trouble in there?\\u201d But the temperature is so high that it just vaporizes. Then I realize I have to leave that there because this is the man consciousness\\u2019 house. But when I get in the hallway and go to say goodbye to Omar, I see two jackets. I realize one is the 4 year old boy, one is the 8 year old boy, and I look at Omar in alarm and say, \\u201cWhat are they doing here in this house?! They\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d But the part of me that is also in the man\\u2019s body sees that they belong to his kids. The consciousness that is me suddenly categorizes the overcrowding of stuff and not tidying up and putting away is from his kids. He\\u2019s making this money and also has this dual role of taking care of his family even though he\\u2019s doing it illegally. At that moment, he\\u2019s simultaneously opening the door and there\\u2019s my own two cats. They get out of the house and start to go up the street which is now a different street. It\\u2019s crowded with people and families. Kids are playing in the snow and it\\u2019s wintertime. Everybody has on snowsuits. There are toboggans and some ice and people are skating. I see my one cat has been interested by a bird. There is a group of people that are around my other cat and they\\u2019re putting snow on him and patting him with the snow and he\\u2019s enjoying it. So I get her first - I catch her just before she leaps into the air to take off after the bird. But I know I can\\u2019t carry them both at the same time. So as I\\u2019m walking back to what is now my own house, I see Kathryn, one of my students, and I ask if she can hold my cat for a moment while I get the other one. She says, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019ll just grab this one.\\u201d And she gets the second cat while I still have my first cat and am putting him back in the house. Then she sets him down for a second while she frolics off and does something else. I just think, \\u201cWhat is wrong with people that they just can\\u2019t follow through?\\u201d Then I put my tiny almost brittle cat back (her spine is uncomfortable when you pick her up and she gets squirmy) in the house and pick up my other one - he\\u2019s much heavier. I can feel his fur and his heavy body and his skin. So now they\\u2019re both back in the house. Everybody is safe and it\\u2019s just my house. My dream ends there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Greenhouse\\u201d This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I\\u2019m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He\\u2019s in a van and he comes out of the van. He\\u2019s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there\\u2019s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can\\u2019t because he can\\u2019t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I\\u2019m draggin him up with me so he can get there. Now it\\u2019s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we\\u2019re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I\\u2019m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it\\u2019s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there\\u2019s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They\\u2019re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They\\u2019re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo! Stop, stop!\\u201d The cat goes backwards, but doesn\\u2019t see where it\\u2019s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I\\u2019m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It\\u2019s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I\\u2019m cradling it in my arms and see that it\\u2019s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The other one is still in there. The cat starts to squirm and wants to get down. The ex comes in and says, \\u201cHow did this mud get in here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, Luke must have tracked it in.\\u201d He glares at me and gets really angry and says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you dare say that name out loud.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? He was here. Didn't you see him outside at the top of the hill?\\u201d Now he\\u2019s really mad at me and tells me I\\u2019m a liar and stop saying that. So I say to him, \\u201cYou didn't see him?\\u201d Then he storms out of the house. Then I remember that Luke told me to get vinegar to pour on it. So I go into the kitchen to get vinegar out from underneath the sink. I pour it on top of the mud that has the maggots and stuff in it. They all die. Then as I\\u2019m cleaning up, the dream deconstructs. I\\u2019m suddenly in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house. I\\u2019m in the process of planting a garden. Their house is huge. It\\u2019s like a mansion down by the shore of the lake. The greenhouse has long raised beds in it and really tall domed windows that arc over the top. They\\u2019re really dirty. There\\u2019s an old garden that looks like it hasn\\u2019t been tended for a while. I leave the greenhouse and walk across the grounds into a shed and find some tools. But as I open the shed door - it\\u2019s creaky and there are cobwebs. I find a hoe and some shears. I take them back to the greenhouse. I start to till and aerate the earth with the hoe. I notice that some of the plants that decayed and died have seeds in them. I\\u2019m making sure that I shake the plant - agitate it a little, so some of the seeds go into the earth as I\\u2019m hoeing. Then a man comes up - I assume he is the gardener. He is wearing a uniform and he questions what I\\u2019m doing. I tell him I am restoring the garden. He starts giving me some instructions. I say, \\u201cDid you used to be the gardener here?\\u201d He says yes. I realize that he\\u2019s also dead. He can\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s instructing me to do. So I listen to him. I ask if he knows where there\\u2019s any vinegar. He says, \\u201cYes, there is some here. I will arrange for it to be delivered to you.\\u201d So I start to till up one side - there are two long raised beds, 30 feet long each. As I till the greyed earth on top, I see there\\u2019s rich black earth underneath. I feel inspired by this task. Then I see that some kind of delivery has appeared. I remember that I also asked him for some balck earth. So there\\u2019s a bag of black earth and some vinegar. There\\u2019re also buckets, cloths and a sponge mop. I think, \\u201cGreat, I can wash these windows so the sun can come through.\\u201d I do that. It looks beautiful. Then on the other side, there\\u2019s a child - I don\\u2019t know who it is. I start showing them how to till up the earth so that seeds can be planted in holes, then how you can make the raised be up around the small plants, then you\\u2019ve got a little line between where water can go and people can walk if needed. So this child is helping me, but I still don\\u2019t know who it is. At the end of the day, I end up with some tall seed flowers in the back, some sustainable things we can eat coming up, as well as some herbs. There\\u2019s soup herbs, soup vegetables, fruit, nuts, pollinator flowers and natural insect repellent flowers. I picked red, yellow, orange and purple flowers. So it\\u2019s going to be a beautiful garden. We\\u2019re not all done, but it\\u2019s just too much to do in one day, so we leave. The child disappears. I\\u2019m walking across the grounds which are quite large. It takes a little bit of time to walk. When I get to the other side, I\\u2019m at the road. I walk up the road. I start to go through the outskirts and through old suburbia with 300 year old trees. I come to a house and realize it\\u2019s a rental. There\\u2019s a bottom floor for rent and top floor for rent. Suddenly a real estate agent appears and is describing when the tenants are leaving. The bottom floor is going to be empty today, the top floor tenants aren\\u2019t going to be leaving for a couple weeks. So she asks if I\\u2019m interested in the bottom floor. Since they are in the process of moving, it\\u2019s okay for us to go in. I really like it. I love the treed lot. There\\u2019s lots of natural shade over the sleeping area. The bedrooms are large and I like how the bedrooms are separated from the activity part of the house. So it will be good for sleeping. The kitchen is nice and big - there\\u2019s enough space for eating and a prep area. So I tell her that I\\u2019ll take it, but I\\u2019m also wanting to put a catio outside of the entry to the backyard so I can put my cats in it and they'll have lots of space to climb and run. Now the current tenant is there. Suddenly he has something I can easily use as a catio. He has a strange creature in it. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog, but as I get closer, I realize it\\u2019s some kind of rodent about the size of a small dog. I think it\\u2019s from South America. He\\u2019s a very sullen man - he doesn\\u2019t look like he wants to talk. I do ask him what kind of pet that is. He doesn\\u2019t answer me. He keeps the same expression on his face. We go back into the house and now I realize that I need roommates for this because there are four bedrooms and I can\\u2019t afford it by myself. There's the question of who will be the roommates. The real estate agent is interviewing some people. Two of them I know there is no way I can live with. One is someone I know and have actually lived with before, and I say, \\u201cYes, that will work. Please interview her.\\u201d Suddenly I\\u2019m moved in and I\\u2019ve been living there for a little while. I have two other roommates. I feel like they came with the house. The one roommate\\u2019s bedroom, when I\\u2019m trying to sleep, they\\u2019re sleeping area moves out like an extending wall in a motorhome. When he goes in to sleep, the bed extends over the feet of my bed and I can\\u2019t stretch my legs out when I'm sleeping. So I don\\u2019t like this arrangement. I contact the real estate agent and say, \\u201cOkay, it\\u2019s been a couple weeks. Are the other tenants getting ready to move out?\\u201d She says yes. So I look at their place. It\\u2019s a little smaller, but I will still be able to keep the catio for my cats. So my dream ends where I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cCan we either ask these two other guys to move out, or is it okay that I just transfer my lease to the other side of the house?\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bird Cage\\u201d In this dream, I am in an apartment building and my neighbor has asked me to feed his dog while he\\u2019s away. He\\u2019s not away for very long, just a couple hours. So when I enter the apartment, the door is not locked. In fact, it\\u2019s ajar. The dog is just lying down on the floor. He has birds in a birdcage. The birds are making a really loud noise. As I approach the birdcage, I notice the door is wide open. The cage is rectangular, 2 feet long, a foot high, and a foot deep. So the door is 2 foot by 1 foot and is open. Yet the birds don\\u2019t try to leave. The song is not the song they would normally make and this puzzles me. There\\u2019s a mixture of birds - pigeons, song birds, sparrows. None of them are making their song. It\\u2019s this rapid alarm noise and they\\u2019re all making it despite different species, which also puzzles me. I wonder if they\\u2019re afraid of the dog. But I\\u2019ve been in this apartment before visiting, and I know that the birds and the dog will sit together on the floor, so I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s the reason. So I feed the dog. Then I wonder why he hasn\\u2019t asked me to feed the birds. I look around to see if there\\u2019s any food and there isn\\u2019t. Then I\\u2019m curious about this noise they\\u2019re making again. And I wonder why they don\\u2019t fly out of the cage because they sound afraid to me. As I get closer to the cage, their noise stops. As I back away , it gets louder. I wonder if I should stay to comfort them. Then the dream just ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Swan Costume\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m in Spain, I think. It\\u2019s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I\\u2019m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it\\u2019s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He\\u2019s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that\\u2019s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I\\u2019m in a different country. I'm a different person. I\\u2019m in a kitchen scene where I\\u2019m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there\\u2019s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I\\u2019m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I\\u2019m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I\\u2019m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It\\u2019s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s kind of interesting.\\u201d I look at it. I have the plant in the other hand. I think, \\u201cHmm, now the seeds from the plant are gone.\\u201d I\\u2019m moving the slats on the shudder in a cupboard and it\\u2019s chafed the seeds out and collected them. So I close the cupboard board and put the bare plant on the counter. I turn around and now there are more dishes on the island. My sibling is doing nothing. I speak sharply to him. I refresh the water in the sink and put the plug back in. I notice that there\\u2019s 4 inches of unwashed cutlery in the bottom that he's been pretending to do. I speak sharply to him about that. Then I do some of it myself, but am thinking that if I keep doing this myself, he\\u2019s never going to learn to do it. So I put fresh water in then turn the tap off and tell him he needs to do his work if he\\u2019s ever going to get out of the area. I go back and finish my own. I\\u2019m disgusted in the dream by the sludge in the bottom of the sink and the pile of food bits and organic waste in the plug that I have to pluck out and dump. The dream flips back to the other scene where I\\u2019m in this palazzo in Spain. Now, the day has progressed and it\\u2019s almost nighttime. My father\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t know where he is. I\\u2019m suddenly supposed to be helping these people find costumes for a masquerade. They come in and I\\u2019m at the end of the palazzo. There\\u2019s a really long bar of clothing hanging from it. People are coming in one at a time, saying what they want to look like. I go through the clothes hanging from the bar and I hand them one and they just walk away with it. It\\u2019s not a line up and not a popular thing. I start to look through the clothing. I become absorbed by the feel of the material. The satins are really dark, the black is really inky and they feel smooth under my fingers. Then this woman comes up. She says, \\u201cDo I have something that will make her have a more shapely butt?\\u201d I think, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I start looking through the clothing and I find something. She says, \\u201cHow do I use this?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m wearing black gloves. As I\\u2019m looking through, the knowledge comes to me and I say, \\u201cYou put this part on and it pushes your low back down into your butt, which loosens the skin a bit. Then you put this part on and it pushes from the hamstrings up to fill it.\\u201d Then I warn her that it says on the tag to be very careful because this can be hard or dangerous for your low back. Then there\\u2019s a costumed part that goes around the upper body. It kind of looks like a man\\u2019s lapel from a suit. So she takes it anyway and walks away. Then I\\u2019m concerned about this. I go to try and find the mother - she\\u2019s not my mother, she\\u2019s just another part of the family that works there. I tell her that someone just wanted that costume. She doesn\\u2019t reply to my question. She says, \\u201cI have something I think you would really like. Wait here for a second.\\u201d She goes and gets it. It\\u2019s white. She says, \\u201cHere, feel this.\\u201d I feel it and it\\u2019s got form to it. It\\u2019s white. There\\u2019s a feathery feel, like the way feathers would feel on a white bird if you just ran your hand over the top of its head and down towards the back with the grain of the feathers. It\\u2019s not stretchy material. It has form to it like a ballet dancer\\u2019s costume. She says to go try it on. As I do this, I see her nephew come in. He\\u2019s a man. He sees me holding that in my hand. Then he looks down. I feel there\\u2019s some kind of disapproval and also some attraction in his eyes. I go into the bathroom and put it on. I make sure I go into the small bathroom only made for only one person because I don\\u2019t want anyone else to see me in this, but I do want to see what it looks like. It has a full length mirror in it. So I put it on. I like the way it contrasts with my brown skin. It feels really nice when I put it on. It has a little bit of weight to it. When I turn around and look in the back, first I notice there\\u2019s a bikini line on my body which is at odds with the line of the costume. The back of the costume comes up like a thong and there\\u2019s a big scooped part that goes up over my hips from the leg. Because it\\u2019s got form to it, it doesn\\u2019t sit on my body - it doesn\\u2019t cling to it. It moves a little bit when I move. I\\u2019m slightly concerned about this because it\\u2019s a bit big for me. But I turn around and it\\u2019s also got these four other pieces that are about maybe 8 inches long, curved gently like an \\u201cS\\u201d the way the downstruck in treble clef goes. They\\u2019re also white and they\\u2019ve got downy feathers around the top. I realize they\\u2019re to frame my eyes. They tuck in with little straps at the top of the costume quite nicely and stay there. So the one curved in sits on the top of the shoulder and it goes up the side of my neck and then curves again gently underneath my eyes towards the inside of my nose. There are two on each side - one goes to the inside of the eye, one goes to the outside of the eye. I actually really like these and I spend a few moments admiring the craftsmanship , the velvety feel of them and the way they fit over the top of the shoulders. I like how they feel around the outside of my eyes. They kind of hide the eyes, too, because it\\u2019s like a masquerade. Then I turn around because I\\u2019m concerned that the costume moves a little bit of its own accord when I\\u2019m walking. Now I notice I\\u2019ve got these really high white heels on. I\\u2019m wishing there was some carpeting on the floor because they\\u2019re quite slippery against the painted stucco and that makes me feel a little nervous. But as I turn around and check out the back again, I bend over a little and think I can't bend over in this and have anyone see me because you can see more of my anatomy than I want roving eyes to be looking at. But as I do this, I feel myself turned on. I feel that move from my body as I look back at the front view in the mirror, I feel heat between my legs and a warmth in my yoni that\\u2019s spreading outwards. I can feel the beginnings of an orgasm and this wakes me up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Ex\\u2019s Whiskey Bottles\\u201d I\\u2019m in an apartment. I\\u2019ve just moved there. I'm surrounded by all these things, almost three-quarters of them are my ex-husband\\u2019s. I don\\u2019t notice this until I\\u2019ve hired two people to come help me clean because I can\\u2019t get it all done. One woman makes a comment that she can\\u2019t clean around all this stuff. She asks me if I can move it. I apologize and say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m trying to go through all this.\\u201d Then I ask her what stuff she\\u2019s talking about. I look at it and the stuff she\\u2019s talking about is gold whiskey decanters. They\\u2019re all different kinds and shapes and they\\u2019re valuable and they\\u2019re all empty. People have given them to us. I never filled them because I don\\u2019t drink whiskey. I didn't throw them away because they were gifts. Some of them I haven\\u2019t even looked in. So she\\u2019s indicating them. I pick them up. These ones are squares - six squares made of gold with rings on the top that you pull on and the decanter slides up out of the square gold carrying case. That\\u2019s when I notice they\\u2019re empty. Then I realize that he\\u2019s taken some of them, but only the ones that had whiskey in them. So I think, \\u201dWhat am I going to do with all these?\\u201d Then I open the door and in the hallway, some sales rep from a whiskey company has set up a display of different kinds of whiskey. I think, \\u201cHmmm, I wonder if I can just set all the decanters up there when they\\u2019re not looking and they'll just think it\\u2019s part of the display.\\u201d So, now I\\u2019m busy with that. I\\u2019m opening the door, peeking out into the hallway, and waiting for all the people to leave so I can do this.\"],[\"\\u201cGetting Ready to Cast Off\\u201d I\\u2019m on my friend Lynn\\u2019s sailboat. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We\\u2019re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I\\u2019ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I\\u2019m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we\\u2019re waiting because the wind has died down. We\\u2019re waiting for the wind to pick up. There\\u2019s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It\\u2019s really silly. I\\u2019m on this dinghy and it\\u2019s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I\\u2019m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I\\u2019m hanging on to the mast and sail. It\\u2019s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I\\u2019m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, \\u201cHmm, I could actually fall asleep here.\\u201d I\\u2019m in danger of doing so. I think, \\u201cWell, I better not fall asleep.\\u201d So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, \\u201cWell, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.\\u201d I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I\\u2019m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I\\u2019m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it\\u2019s not in the dreamscape anymore. I\\u2019m swinging around on this rope. I\\u2019m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I\\u2019m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I\\u2019m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I\\u2019ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn\\u2019t get tangled on anything. Now I\\u2019m wondering what else I\\u2019m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they\\u2019ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, \\u201cOh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I\\u2019ll paint rocks.\\u201d So all of a sudden, there\\u2019s another person who I actually work with, though I\\u2019ve never sailed with her - I don\\u2019t think she sails. She\\u2019s been invited to go on the boat. I\\u2019m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she\\u2019s doing to pass the time and she\\u2019s painting rocks. I think, \\u201cWell this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she\\u2019s used.\\u201d I kind of go up tentatively because I don\\u2019t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, \\u201cWhat kind of paint are you using for that?\\u201d She tells me that it\\u2019s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, \\u201cNo, I just came back from Michael\\u2019s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they\\u2019re doing something that\\u2019s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.\\u201d So I ask her where it is and she says, \\u201cHere, it\\u2019s on this map and it\\u2019s marked with an X so that we don\\u2019t go there.\\u201d I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don\\u2019t want Lynn to know I\\u2019ve gone to Michael\\u2019s as well because she\\u2019ll be upset. So I think, \\u201cI\\u2019ll just go to the Dollar Store.\\u201d As I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store, I don\\u2019t have any shoes. I\\u2019m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they\\u2019re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I\\u2019ve got a bag. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I\\u2019ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It\\u2019s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we\\u2019re going to cat off. But we don\\u2019t! It\\u2019s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she\\u2019s been sewing something. She asks me if I\\u2019d like to make something. I say, \\u201cWell, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you\\u2019re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it\\u2019s very cooling. So I\\u2019ll make one of those.\\u201d So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That\\u2019s the end of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cSpirit People\\u201d I\\u2019m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they\\u2019re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We\\u2019re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don\\u2019t say anything. I\\u2019m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it\\u2019s on the top floor. She says, \\u201cThis is where we\\u2019re supposed to go - my contact is up here.\\u201d We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we\\u2019re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we\\u2019re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I\\u2019m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, \\u201cWait here. I\\u2019ll be back in a moment.\\u201d So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.\\u201d The first yoga class is all the bride\\u2019s family. They\\u2019re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that\\u2019s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I\\u2019m figuring there\\u2019s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they\\u2019re serving food. They\\u2019re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren\\u2019t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I\\u2019m suggesting we leave. But they\\u2019re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they\\u2019re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person\\u2019s hair. I look and it\\u2019s someone I recognize. I didn\\u2019t know her very well, though, and I hadn\\u2019t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I\\u2019d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I\\u2019m hugging her and saying, \\u201cWow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so very long,\\u201d I realize in my dream mind that she\\u2019s dead. We don\\u2019t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I\\u2019m seeing more people that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there\\u2019s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don\\u2019t know her - we don\\u2019t have any close conversations. She\\u2019s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, \\u201cOh, that can\\u2019t be good and why don\\u2019t you say something...you\\u2019re passive to this?\\u201d Then her son comes up. I just know it\\u2019s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: \\u201cI can tell whose son this is!\\u201d I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, \\u201cAlright, it\\u2019s time to go. We don\\u2019t have anything to do here.\\u201d So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re just gone. I look down and I\\u2019ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they\\u2019re attached. I think, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t mine.\\u201d I know where it\\u2019s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, \\u201cHey, I think this is yours.\\u201d He looks at it and says, \\u201cOh, I haven\\u2019t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.\\u201d I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I\\u2019m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can\\u2019t accept it until I\\u2019ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I\\u2019m waiting and it looks like he\\u2019s going to disappear back into the store and I\\u2019ve still got this pot I\\u2019m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it\\u2019s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I\\u2019m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I\\u2019m walking into Mandy\\u2019s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it\\u2019s been there for ages. There\\u2019s another pair over by the sink. There\\u2019s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I\\u2019m just hearing the voice and deduce that it\\u2019s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It\\u2019s covered with seran wrap. It\\u2019s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, \\u201cOh, she\\u2019s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!\\u201d So, I ask her if she\\u2019d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there\\u2019s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it\\u2019s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He\\u2019s got hair like Mo from the \\u201cThree Stooges\\u201d but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it\\u2019s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he\\u2019s dead and she\\u2019s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I\\u2019m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there\\u2019s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I\\u2019m wearing my own wedding dress. He\\u2019s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He\\u2019s talking to me about something and I don\\u2019t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we\\u2019re in our bedroom and making love.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Feast\\u201d The dream is strange and hard to articulate. There are moments when I\\u2019m in the dream and moments where I\\u2019m looking down and observing the events of the dream. So it starts with being in a carpool parking lot where you're waiting for others to arrive and you leave your car there, then gather in one car. I\\u2019m standing in the parking lot waiting. The car with two people in it that I\\u2019m supposed to join arrives. I leave my car there and I don\\u2019t see it for the rest of the dream. I know one of the people in the car - my friend, Janice. She\\u2019s a paraplegic. The car has hand controls on the steering wheel. Her chair is behind me in the passenger seat. This car will only fit one other person. The other person is supposed to meet us there. We wait for a little bit and she doesn\\u2019t show up. It\\u2019s Lisa, a person I know but am no longer friends with. After we wait a little bit and decide she must not be coming and just didn't tell us, we leave and we drive down the expansive highway to where we\\u2019re supposed to be going - a wedding reception. At this point, I\\u2019m suddenly elevated above the car and watching it move along the highway. I\\u2019m not so far up that it looks like a dot on the map. Maybe it\\u2019s a birds eye view. I can see the trees. I can see the ground. I can see the roofs of houses - they aren\\u2019t that far down from my vision. So I see the car arrive in the parking lot of where the reception is supposed to be held. Then, I help get the chair out for Janice and she gets in it and we both enter into the wedding reception area. She\\u2019s sitting with different people than I am, so we part at the door. I find my seat. I\\u2019m sitting with this man. His name is James and he is the estranged brother of one of my closest friends, Maggie. He is an intolerant angry negative person. I wonder what he\\u2019s going to do next. There\\u2019s a series of platters of bread that the servers bring out from the kitchen. As they set them on the table, people start passing them to the right. Nobody is eating anything. We\\u2019re just passing these plates. At some point they stop being passed and are set down on the table. I look and the differences between the plates of bread are miniscule. Most of the plates are full of square pieces of bread - square buns. Some are plain. Some are glazed. Some have powdery substance. I wonder why no one is eating them. I take one off the plate. I ask James if he\\u2019s going to eat it and wait for his snarky reply. But he doesn\\u2019t say anything and he just takes one of them, takes a bite and sets it down on his plate. I do the same. I wonder who\\u2019s wedding this is. I look around for signs of who\\u2019s the bride and who\\u2019s the groom. I don\\u2019t like the bread. It tastes like sawdust and I only took a tiny tiny bite and set the rest of it down on my plate. I get up and start to wander around the table. It\\u2019s one long table full of people and there\\u2019s the sense that there\\u2019s other tables around me, but my peripheral vision is clouded. I can\\u2019t tell who\\u2019s sitting where. Then, I rise upwards again. I\\u2019m looking at this whole area from the birds eye view. I\\u2019m not quite clear what I\\u2019m looking for, but am just seeing cars coming and going on the highway. It\\u2019s the same thing every time. After a dream moment of doing that, I drop back down to the table again. This time I\\u2019m standing between Janice and somebody else at their end of the table. I\\u2019m aware that they\\u2019re talking, but I\\u2019m not involved in their conversation.I stand there for a few moments, then walk back to my empty seat at the other end of the table. Now there\\u2019s food on myplate. It\\u2019s an uninteresting selection of meat with gravy and mashed potatoes and carrots. I don\\u2019t eat any of it. I just look at it. I\\u2019m disengaged now from the feast and the people and the festivities. I see one other person I know enter into the reception hall. It\\u2019s a friend I\\u2019ve known for years, his name is Joshua. I go over to talk with him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Praying Mantis\\u201d My friend, Randy, asks me if I want to be part of a housing project that is on an island in the Carribean. I agree. We arrive on the island and he tells me that the house that we are going to build first, the one we can stay in and it\\u2019s not going to be on the land, it will be situated on rocks where the water flows, just off of the land. So we get off the airplane and get into a jeep. We\\u2019re riding in the jeep. One of the people that lives on the island is with us. The scenery is flat and wide and it\\u2019s hot and dusty, arid and dry. We arrive down to where the housing project will begin. True enough, as we get out of the jeep, there\\u2019s land and it\\u2019s slightly marshy and there\\u2019s a dividing line with rocks coming out from underneath the crust of land. There\\u2019s a little bit of water and it flows out from the crust like a very small stream, about 6 inches deep overtop some flat rocks. He says this is where the house will begin. There\\u2019s a number of people that live on the island that are already aware of this project. They are present. So we start to construct the house out of cement. The cement needs to be mixed. It\\u2019s poured and then it hardens. The walls are erected with these 2x4\\u2019s. The men are doing this part and Randy has already asked me previous to landing to design a garden. This is something he doesn\\u2019t know how to do himself, but I\\u2019m good at it. I\\u2019ve agreed. So while the men are doing that part, I\\u2019ve got some large pieces of paper, colored pens, and a geometry or drafting set. I start to sketch out the garden, being careful to also sketch out the house first that is not on the land at all and is not supposed to be touching the land, but is supported by the rocks. The house gets to the point where I can now help with some of the internal construction. I notice I\\u2019m wearing work boots, socks, a pair of cargo shorts, a cotton top and a cotton cap that I\\u2019ve made myself. I\\u2019m doing small construction jobs and am working the saw. We\\u2019re beginning the internal part of the house - a covered kitchen and closets in the rooms. Now there are more people helping. I\\u2019ve finished my garden drawing, colored it in and added some vegetation. At this point, one of the women involved in the project has commented on what I\\u2019m wearing. I\\u2019ve promised to make her a cotton top and cap, and also show her how to work a sewing machine. This is going to be on a next trip because I don\\u2019t have any of these things with me. The sun begins to set. People are passing around some oranges as well as something that looks like beer. I accept some of the food and drink and sit in the lawn chair. Randy has indicated that he wants me to sit in between him and one of the other people that live there. So I do. He starts asking me to share my knowledge of the garden and what I know of finishing houses like this on the inside. As I\\u2019m describing this, I realize that this kind of house and this project is a house that has not been built in this way before. Part of it is that the house is not supposed to be able to be swept away by the water. Also, the water has started to flow over the area around the house - it\\u2019s like a dock, but it\\u2019s not. Although, I\\u2019m also starting to see that there will be small boats that can go up and down using the current of the water. They don\\u2019t have keels. They will be tied up to posts that look like angle irons that have been pounded down around the house and this little bit of deck. The house is really small - it looks like the size of a shipping container. You\\u2019ll get your feet wet when you walk into the house. I wonder how practical this will be for spreading things that are on your feet from the land, onto the deck, into the house. But I see that your feet are clean - they are washed by the water by the time you get into the house. So now the sun has started to set and I\\u2019m getting a little bit cold sitting on the lawn chair. I move to go inside the house. Now I see that Randy has stocked some things to the living room, which is finished to the point that the walls and roof are there. There's a rudimentary shell of a kitchen. He also has a stereo. There is electricity now, which wasn\\u2019t in the original plan. He\\u2019s plugged something in and is playing music. He gets out an album and I notice that it's Led Zeppelin, but it\\u2019s one I\\u2019ve never heard before. I think this is weird because I know all their music. He puts it on and I listen to one side and comment to him, \\u201cOh this song is why you played this side of the album, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d He says, yes. It\\u2019s the only thing I can recognize that sounds like Led Zeppelin - a little bit of the guitar. It sounds like Jimmy Page is playing something, somewhat in his own style, but an instrument I don\\u2019t recognize - guitar like, but not actually guitar. Now it\\u2019s nighttime, our flight is due to go back, the day is over and any work we have left will be completed when we come back next time. So we pack things up and get into the jeep to go back. When I get in the jeep, suddenly Omar is there and he\\u2019s sitting beside me in the jeep. He\\u2019s asking me about what we\\u2019ve done there. I realize that Randy can see him. Randy is acting strange, almost like he\\u2019s somewhat possessive or jealous of me and the relationship that Omar and I have. I think this is odd because we\\u2019re just friends. However, we arrive at the airport and Omar doesn\\u2019t get in the plane. Randy and I do, and we have a conversation on the plane. First he looks at my drawings of the garden. He has some markers - there\\u2019s a bright orange, deep red and brilliant blue. He starts marking up the areas on the drawing. He\\u2019s asking, \\u201cWhat can I grow here?\\u201d I tell him. He uses the red marker for that. Then he asks, \\u201cWhat are some things that will grow in this area?\\u201d I describe the kind of food. He marks those and draws in some things with the orange. Same things with the other area and he draws in those with the brilliant blue. Then he puts the drawing away and. Then he asks me about the conversation I had with the woman. I say, \\u201cYes, I think there\\u2019s potential. I can teach her how to make all this clothing with the sewing machine, but I\\u2019m going to have to buy one to bring down there next time.\\u201d He asks, \\u201cHow are you going to get down there?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, isn\\u2019t that included in my work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re going to have to pay for your own flight to come back.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s not what we agreed on when I said I\\u2019d be part of this project.\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s acting jealous because of what I noticed in the jeep with Omar. That\\u2019s when I ask him about his behavior with Omar. He doesn\\u2019t reply to me directly. He doesn\\u2019t answer my questions. Now there\\u2019s this strange energy between us and I remain silent. When we get off the plane, there\\u2019s a gap in the dream. Instantly from the airport, I am now suddenly at Omar\\u2019s mother\\u2019s place and there's a summer gathering. It\\u2019s a potluck and a beautiful day out. It\\u2019s lovely to be in the family again. But I know they aren\\u2019t real and I just enjoy the day where it is. Then it disintegrates. I\\u2019m back in the project with Randy. I don't have enough money for the plane ticket and I don\\u2019t feel like I belong in that group anymore. There\\u2019s energy that is not what I thought it was going to be at the beginning. I\\u2019m reflecting on the day. I look down at my hands and I notice that they\\u2019re curled. The fingers are curled towards my wrists and they don\\u2019t look like my hands. Then I see that the relationships I had with the people don\\u2019t seem as authentic as I thought they were. Then I look at my shoulders and my shoulders look narrow and rounded. I think there\\u2019s something about me that looks insectoid. But it shifts and I\\u2019m thinking if I want to go back and finish this project. I\\u2019m torn between the promises I made to the woman who felt genuine to me and the now soured energy that I feel in my relationship with Randy and the project. But I look down at myself and I realize that my body doesn\\u2019t look like mine at all. I look like a praying mantis and I hate myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Dolphin\\u201d This was more of a visitation than a dream, where a dolphin or the frequency of dolphin kept engaging with my psyche as I was dreaming. I felt like it was trying to comfort me in some way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Language\\u201d This dream is a little complicated to explain. The best way I can lay out the architecture is that it\\u2019s kind of like a spiral. The first layer, when I go through it, I\\u2019m not quite in it, then each layer I'm a little deeper in. There\\u2019s also a vehicle for getting there and I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It doesn't move on the land. It\\u2019s not an airplane. It doesn\\u2019t go way high up in the sky. It hovers a little above the rooftops - perhaps the layer where birds are normally in, though I don\\u2019t see any birds in the dream. It moves really quickly. It moves through time, as well. So the dream begins. I\\u2019m exiting out of this vehicle into a town. I\\u2019m walking around the town looking for where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I don\\u2019t understand any of the language being spoken. So, I can\\u2019t ask anyone where to go. I\\u2019m just trying to feel my way around. I\\u2019m looking for a mental map of the things I need. For example, I\\u2019m looking for a place to eat, a place to study, a place to sleep. So the first time I go through here, I\\u2019m feeling ungrounded. I\\u2019m alienated because I don\\u2019t speak the language. But I\\u2019m starting to feel familiar with the urban landscape. There's a certain time I have to leave. I need to be back at that vehicle. So I\\u2019m rushing to get there. I get back in it and I leave. Then I re-enter that same town, exiting the vehicle. This time I\\u2019m looking for parks and recreational places. I\\u2019m looking for a place to swim and rest outside - not necessarily a beach, but a place I can rest after swimming. This time I have my son with me. We have found a place to rent bicycles and have rented a tandem bicycle. So I place my son on the back and I\\u2019m on the front. We both have little backpacks with what we need for the day. We are just leisurely riding around. We go to the place for swimming, not an ocean, I have a feeling it might be man made because it\\u2019s too small to be a lake. It\\u2019s quite beautiful. The water is clean and fresh, and there\\u2019s a groomed grassy area, as you would find in a park. We lay down some big towels that we\\u2019ve taken from our backpacks and we\\u2019re just lying there resting. It\\u2019s a nice day. After a little while we get hungry. I\\u2019ve already scouted a place where we can eat. So we get back on the bicycles and take our towels and everything with us. But our towels are wet and I notice that they\\u2019re wet when I put them in the packs. I\\u2019m thinking that we\\u2019ll need a place to spread them out so they don\\u2019t get moldy. So I take my son on the bicycle. We go to the place to eat. The food is good and tasty. I\\u2019m trying to decipher the language that the people speak. As I taste the food, I\\u2019m trying to taste the language. I\\u2019m trying to decipher it by noticing the flavors. When we\\u2019re both finished, instead of getting back on the bicycle, we walk through the urban area where we\\u2019ve eaten. I think, \\u201cWow, it would be really nice to have some kind of memento from the day.\\u201d So we enter one of the shops. It\\u2019s quite dingy. There are tables set out in garage sale type style. To enter the shop, you go through the door and downstairs to the basement, which is probably why it feels so dingy and dark. But the items on the table are quite expensive and big. A lot of them are made of big chunks of led crystal. I don\\u2019t want to carry something around like this - it\\u2019s not really my thing, anyway. They\\u2019re really rather formal. But we see this little spoon. It\\u2019s like a baby spoon, made of silver - it\\u2019s good metal. I look at the top of the spoon and it\\u2019s actually carved into - a rough rendition of Pikachu. I call my son over and say, \\u201cLook! Who\\u2019s that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cPikachu.\\u201d I say, yes. Pikachu is wearing a little hat with a small tiny delicate chain from the center of the hat down and there\\u2019s a hook on the end of it. There\\u2019s a hole drilled into the spoon and the hook sits there nicely, so it doesn\\u2019t dangle and it\\u2019s actually part of Pikachu\\u2019s hat. So I purchase the spoon and we put it in our backpack. Now I\\u2019m thinking we have to spread these towels. Now I\\u2019m wondering if we\\u2019re staying here and I\\u2019m starting to get a little bit nervous because it is getting dark. We don\\u2019t appear to be leaving in the vehicle and I haven\\u2019t arranged for us anywhere to sleep. So we\\u2019re back up on street level and I\\u2019m walking to where we entered this level. But then I see that more people are walking that way and I see the vehicle. We get in the vehicle and sleep on it. Nice passes really quickly, then we exit back out at daytime. This time I have both my son and daughter. My daughter is older than my son. I\\u2019m bringing them with me to a house that I\\u2019ve prearranged to meet someone in - someone I had forgotten that I met on the first voyage there. So we do this. We\\u2019re not on the bicycle this time, we\\u2019re just walking. We get to the house and there\\u2019s a library upstairs. So I take my kids up to the third floor and they\\u2019re in the library. Then I walk back to the first floor to meet the person I\\u2019m supposed to be studying the language with. It\\u2019s someone I feel I\\u2019ve met before - there\\u2019s some familiarity about the man. We sit at a table and he\\u2019s teaching me a word and I\\u2019m repeating it - that\\u2019s how I\\u2019m learning, back and forth rote memory style. Then I ask him, \\u201cIs there a washing machine here? I still have these things from the picnic and I need to wash and dry them. They are muddy and wet.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, there\\u2019s one in the basement. Help yourself.\\u201d So I take everything down, load the washing machine, put soap in it, and come back upstairs. Then I realize I\\u2019ve put my muddy pants in there and I\\u2019m just wearing my underwear and the shirt I had on underneath. I ask him if there\\u2019s anything I can borrow. He says, yes. He hands me a pair of pajama bottoms. So I wear those and we continue the language lesson. We continue for a bit longer, then I go back downstairs to switch the laundry and put things in the dryer. I come back up the stairs. This time, there\\u2019s a second person in there for a language lesson. I also recognize him - he\\u2019s a colleague. So now the first man I was learning from is tutoring someone else and I\\u2019m practicing the language with my colleague, Keith. We both have a test coming up and we\\u2019re studying together practicing this language. The first man who is the tutor comes back into the room with Keith and me. He says the time is up. Keith leaves. I go back and get our laundry and put in our packs. I thank the man for his time. My kids have come downstairs from the library and we get our packs. I never take the test. We just get back in the vehicle and leave. There\\u2019s one more layer where I come back. I exit the same vehicle into a landscape with the same kind of architecture. This time I don\\u2019t have my kids. I walk to the place where I had picnicked with my son. I\\u2019m taking my time. It\\u2019s a nice day. The weather is temperate - not too hot, not too cold. I\\u2019m not swimming. I\\u2019m just lying on the grass in meditation, looking at the clear blue sky. I rest there for some time. It feels really good. The day is only half gone and the vehicle isn\\u2019t coming back until the end of the day. So I still have half a day to spend. I don\\u2019t want to stay by the beach anymore. So I walk back through the small town. I\\u2019m not feeling particularly hungry. I end up at the house where I had studied before. Before I go in, I see the same man that had tutored me. There\\u2019s still a nagging question in my mind about where I had seen him before. He waves over to me and indicates that I should come in even though I don\\u2019t have an appointment. We go back into the room where I had the tutoring session before. He indicates with his hand that I should sit down. So I do. Only this time he has a plate of food. He divides it into two and pushes one plate over to me and keeps the other plate for himself. I\\u2019m eating this really, really slowly, trying to figure out the flavors. I don't even know what the food pieces are. So I\\u2019m eating slowly and thinking about it. He hands me this other thing. It is the size of a potato, but not as hard as a raw potato. It feels like a thick, doughy thing. I wonder what it is. He indicates that I should dip it into the food, then take a bite. So I do. It tastes somewhat bread like, but doughier. I still don\\u2019t understand the spices. Actually I don\\u2019t like the texture of it. After the first bite, I set it back down and continue to eat the food with my fingers. Then I wish I had the spoon I bought last time and gave to my son. Then he gets up and indicates for me to look at my legs. I see that my pants are all muddy again. He asks me in the language if I want to use the washing machine. I say yes. Then I stand there for a second. He takes that same soft pajama-like thing out of the door and hands it to me. So I go back downstairs to where the laundry is and I take the rest of the things from my pack because they aren\\u2019t clean either. I put everything into the washing machine and come back up with the soft clothing on. Now he\\u2019s sitting down on the floor. There\\u2019s something on the television, which I hadn\\u2019t noticed was there. I sit down on the floor beside him. I don\\u2019t understand the language that the people on the tv are using. So I kind of drift off and am daydreaming. I am just waiting for the laundry to finish. He comes over a little closer to me and I feel that there\\u2019s some kind of sexual energy between us. Then I suddenly remember who he is. He\\u2019s someone I had tea with on a meetup - I was just meeting him, but we never went on a date. But there\\u2019s energy there. He just brushes down my arm, down the side of my leg with his hand, like he is testing to see where this is going to go. I do feel my body respond - it\\u2019s warm. But I don\\u2019t really want to engage with him that way. I still acknowledge that it felt nice, though. He backs away, but doesn't go too far. He seems content with just acknowledging that the energy is there but not taking it any further. Then we move closer to each other again and just stay there, touching, until I think my laundry is done. Then I go to the basement, get the laundry, change and give him back the pajamas he lent me and go out the door to the vehicle to fly off somewhere.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Photo Chest\\u201d I\\u2019m walking across a really long bridge. It feels a little bit cold and windy and as though I\\u2019m walking against the wind and uphill. The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that\\u2019s been empty for a few years. It\\u2019s where my daughter\\u2019s grandparents used to live. They\\u2019ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter\\u2019s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It\\u2019s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It\\u2019s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There\\u2019s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There\\u2019s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It\\u2019s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There\\u2019s one point where I\\u2019m a little bit surprised at Roberta\\u2019s description. They aren\\u2019t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter\\u2019s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There\\u2019s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it\\u2019s her because her face doesn\\u2019t really change. She\\u2019s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I\\u2019d never heard of this woman before. I\\u2019m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn\\u2019t aware of. We just pass the day looking through all these generations of mostly women in the photographs. It was lovely.\"],[\"\\u201cPieces of I.D.\\u201d I\\u2019m in something that feels like the shape of an orchestra pit. It\\u2019s quite crowded with people. A few of the people are sitting in front of drafting boards. The drafting boards take up a lot of room - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019re almost side to side. There are more people than drafting boards, so the excess people make it feel really packed. I feel like I have some kind of amnesia as I sit in front of my drafting board. I don\\u2019t know what I'm supposed to be drawing. So I start to circulate amongst the people. It\\u2019s all hazy. I don\\u2019t know anyone, I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to draw. I\\u2019m approaching some of the people. I\\u2019m climbing over other people that are just sitting there. It\\u2019s literally packed with people. I\\u2019m hearing rather than seeing that some people are involved in a conversation with their drafting board. I realize that even though you can\\u2019t really see what they\\u2019ve drawn, the conversation they are having with it is they are telling it their life story, but there are too many details to draw. So there\\u2019s another kind of media that produces an imprint on the drafting board, the person who is the architect of their life. Then I have some kind of idea of what is supposed to be on mine and I make my way back to it, but then I can\\u2019t remember what I\\u2019m supposed to put on it. I know there\\u2019s a conversation, but I don\\u2019t have enough of an idea of what mine is in order to begin the conversation that will imprint upon my drafting board. So in an effort to discover more detail, I leave the orchestra pit adn I start to walk towards a building. I realize the building is a hospital. I enter in the front door. I decide to get on the elevator and go up. I don\\u2019t press any buttons; the elevator moves on its own accord. It stops at a floor and I get off. It\\u2019s some kind of surgery and recovery floor. I wander around for a bit. There are some nurses and other staff around but I don\\u2019t engage with them. Then I get back on the elevator. This time it goes down. I get off. I didn't find anything that gave me any inspiration either to remember or tell my story. So I wander out the front door. Instead of going back to the pit, I walk through the street. I look to see if there\\u2019s anything that sparks any memory. It\\u2019s an urban street with all kinds of people. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are vendors and street artists drawing. At one point I get tired of walking and so I sit down on a bench. The bench is not parallel to the street. It\\u2019s perpendicular to the street, around the side of the building. I sit there just resting. A man was sitting there the whole time, but I didn\\u2019t see him. Now that my eyes have adjusted, I start to see him. I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll just stay there and be quiet. But he doesn\\u2019t. He starts trying to engage with me and talk with me. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. In fact he seems kind of abrasive and now he\\u2019s in my space. Instead of sitting on his own bench, he\\u2019s now come up beside me. I feel slightly threatened by his presence. I reach into my pockets, make two fists and shove them into my pockets. I feel something in my right hand and it\\u2019s three cards - they feel plastic, like credit cards. I pull them out and I look at them. It\\u2019s my identification. One is a driver's license. One is a bank card. The other one I think is a social insurance card. They have my name on them. My driver\\u2019s license even has a picture of me. I suddenly remember who I am. I\\u2019m afraid the man is going to steal them even though they aren't worth any money. I think he might take my ID. So, I put them back in my pocket. It looks like he hasn\\u2019t seen them, so I\\u2019m thinking this is good. I stand up slowly and walk away. I turn right, trying to remember where I live. I walk up the street. I see with some dismay, my ex-husband. My first instinct is to turn around and go the other way. But I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, he probably knows where I live.\\u201d I decide to tackle this anyway. As I walk through the crowd of people, he recognizes me and looks up. I stop in front of him. But I don\\u2019t want him to know that I can\\u2019t remember where I live. So as I approach and slow my pace, I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll say something to me first. He does. He asks me where I\\u2019m going. I say I\\u2019m heading home. He says, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I wait, hoping he\\u2019ll give me some clue where that is. He doesn\\u2019t say anything. Then he says, \\u201cJust a second. I\\u2019m trying to load up these bags.\\u201d I look down and he\\u2019s got shopping bags. He has a lot of stuff that he\\u2019s trying to put inside of them. It looks to me like he doesn\\u2019t have enough bags. He keeps putting things in, then taking them out, trying to reorganize them in an effort to fit everything. Then he hands me the bags and says, \\u201cCan you do this?\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer, but I just start to organize. Then he wanders off. I'm just organizing his stuff in the bags and I\\u2019m actually making it all fit. It reminds me of packing to go places when we were married and how he would say things didn\\u2019t fit in the car, and I would go and fit it in. It reminded me that I always had to do stuff for him. I\\u2019m slightly irritated that here I am back on the street and trying to find my way home, and here I am waylaid by trying to put his stuff in his bags. Then I focus again on the task. A woman comes up and asks if any of this is for sale. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not mine.\\u201d But as I look at the bags, I see one has some of my stuff in it and am wondering what it is. It\\u2019s CD\\u2019s. So I look at them and wonder why he has all my CD\\u2019s. As I\\u2019m wondering this he arrives and says, \\u201cOh, I see you\\u2019re finished. It all fit. This is good. Let\\u2019s go now. Why don\\u2019t you take that bag? I\\u2019ll take the rest.\\u201d It\\u2019s the one with my own CD\\u2019s in it. I decide to ask him, \\u201cDo you know where these belong?\\u201d and I indicate the bag of CD\\u2019s. He says, yes. I say, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust up the street a couple blocks.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh, good. He knows where I live.\\u201d So I decide that\\u2019s good. Then I ask, \\u201cDo you know where the rest of my purse is? I\\u2019ve only got these three pieces of ID.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s in one of those bags.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Barge\\u201d A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It\\u2019s quite intricate and detailed. I\\u2019m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don\\u2019t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we\\u2019re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I\\u2019ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I\\u2019m just standing there. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m at a really large lake or an ocean. I\\u2019m just watching. I\\u2019m looking at the water. You can\\u2019t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It\\u2019s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It\\u2019s also very balmy and a bit windy. I\\u2019m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It\\u2019s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They\\u2019re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I\\u2019m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I\\u2019m being told that it\\u2019s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it\\u2019s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we\\u2019re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I\\u2019m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I\\u2019m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don\\u2019t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I\\u2019ve been with before. I don\\u2019t try to join them because they\\u2019re in a family grouping. There\\u2019s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don\\u2019t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I\\u2019ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what\\u2019s there. There are muffins. But I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re gluten-free and I know I can\\u2019t eat wheat, so I don\\u2019t get them. There\\u2019s something else on the table. I\\u2019m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she\\u2019s too short and can\\u2019t reach it. I\\u2019m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, \\u201cMy mom said I can have one.\\u201d So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, \\u201cJust a minute, let\\u2019s find your parents.\\u201d She points further up the pier and says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re over there.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t see anybody. She\\u2019s fairly determined and tugging me. We\\u2019re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It\\u2019s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, \\u201cOh look! It\\u2019s garbage day.\\u201d So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It\\u2019s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I\\u2019m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there\\u2019s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it\\u2019s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that\\u2019s on the pier. I think. \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d The post is still standing. I think that\\u2019s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, \\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they\\u2019re supposed to be here. He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see anyone.\\u201d I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there\\u2019s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they\\u2019ve all been in this trauma but she\\u2019s not going to go because she\\u2019s not ready. Now I\\u2019m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I\\u2019m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I\\u2019ve got my laptop with me and I don\\u2019t want to take it. I say to her, \\u201cIs it okay if I leave this in your room?\\u201d She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I\\u2019m getting into a Jeep. It\\u2019s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they\\u2019re all cut out for open air. So I\\u2019m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it\\u2019s cleared out and doesn\\u2019t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There\\u2019s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they\\u2019re with. I don\\u2019t have a \\u201cwhoever I\\u2019m with\\u201d so I don\\u2019t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. You can\\u2019t see the sun overhead, though. There\\u2019s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It\\u2019s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don\\u2019t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven\\u2019t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don\\u2019t know what time we\\u2019re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don\\u2019t see any. At one point the day feels like it\\u2019s gone on. I am hungry but I don\\u2019t have any food. I\\u2019m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren\\u2019t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I\\u2019m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I\\u2019m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they\\u2019re having together and they don\\u2019t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I\\u2019m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I\\u2019m looking for staff to help me. I\\u2019m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I\\u2019m going to miss supper as well. I\\u2019ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Reunion\\u201d I\\u2019m invited to some kind of gathering, I don\\u2019t know what the purpose is, except that I feel I should go. I have a little hesitancy about this because it\\u2019s enough of a drive for me that I\\u2019m thinking that by the time I get there, I\\u2019m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I\\u2019m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there\\u2019s a bottle of wine - there\\u2019s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I\\u2019ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I\\u2019ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don\\u2019t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there\\u2019s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar\\u2019s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He\\u2019s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, \\u201cit\\u2019s been a long time.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes it has.\\u201d We sit down next to each other and we\\u2019re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we\\u2019re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I\\u2019m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don\\u2019t know. So I\\u2019m not very happy about this. She\\u2019s apparently acting as though she\\u2019s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She\\u2019s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there\\u2019s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven\\u2019t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself from the table and go find my bags and give them to the hostess. When I get back from doing that though, more people have left their seats. I\\u2019m kind of relieved. I didn\\u2019t eat very much, but at least I\\u2019m not stranded in this awkward and ingenuous conversation with the woman. I realize that there\\u2019s been a gift for each of the people at their seats. They didn\\u2019t even notice it. The hostess is a little bit distressed about this - the fact that no one brought anything with them and that no one has noticed that there\\u2019s gifts at the table for each of them, and furthermore that people came and brought their toddlers and kids and left them unsupervised running all over the house. Basically what\\u2019s happened is the guests have been quite oblivious as guests and taken way more latitude than was offered and the house is trashed. Everything is everywhere. The guests have all left. They haven\\u2019t even taken their plates from the table. It\\u2019s just a mess. So I just start cleaning up. I\\u2019m helping by clearing the table and doing dishes. I make a point of thanking the hostess for my gift, which is a pair of silver candleholders that are like the Kokopeli character and they look like they were fashioned in Mexico. I thank her for her thoughtfulness. There\\u2019s also a gingerbread kit where the pieces of gingerbread are wrapped up in saran wrap. You would make your own icing and put them together. It\\u2019s a little mini house. As I\\u2019m thanking her, she\\u2019s enough upset that no one else did, that my words kind of fall around her like they\\u2019re unprocessed by her. She goes down into the basement. I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing down there. I am still cleaning upstairs. I continue helping with the dishes. There are a couple other of her family members - her two kids are helping. The dishes basically get done, but it takes a little while. I go into another room where the toddlers have trashed it. Omar is there. We gaze at each other. I feel his eyes. He beckons to me. He wants me to lie down with him. I say, \\u201cNo, I can\\u2019t do that. There are people and toddlers and stuff here.\\u201d We go upstairs. He\\u2019s cleaning, too, that\\u2019s what he was doing in the other room. We go upstairs and these kids have taken all the clothes out of the dresser. As I\\u2019m picking and folding clothes up, there\\u2019s a dirty diaper on the floor. We are tidying all of this up and trying to make their house right.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Drew\\u2019s\\u201d I am staying with a large family and they live in a house with many rooms. The backyard has a pool. The property extends back beyond a cedar hedge, which is as tall as the house, into another property behind it that has an old cottage on it. There's another old cottage behind that one. I have a room up on the second floor. It\\u2019s a bedroom. On this particular day, we are gathering in the pool. It\\u2019s a warm pool and the waters have some kind of healing property to them. The patriarch of the family is getting old and he has arthritis in his hips. He has trouble getting down the stairs, through the house, and then lowering himself into the pool. He\\u2019s also quite overweight and it makes the arthritis in the hips even worse. However, he does manage to get into the pool and he\\u2019s just soaking in it. There\\u2019s a conversation that begins to occur about whether or not everybody should stay in that house because the mobility issues. Alos, there are several people, including me, that are staying there. One person is helping clean. She\\u2019s sleeping on a bench with a cushion on it in the kitchen. She doesn\\u2019t have a room of her own. There are two other people aside from her that also don\\u2019t have actual rooms. While this discussion is occuring in the spa pool. I\\u2019m thinking that if we just rearrange the rooms a little bit with who\\u2019s sleeping where, there would be room for everyone and everyone would have a bed. It might be better not to move because moves are disruptive and the next house is going to have similar problems as this one, unless it\\u2019s possible to find a low ranch style home. So I voice my suggestion. So some people move downstairs and other people from the kitchen move up to the top floor. The patriarch doesn\\u2019t have to climb any stairs. This way when we do the shuffle, there is room for everyone, including the people sleeping in the kitchen. The family agrees this is a good idea. After the pool, we go into the house to tell the girl that\\u2019s been sleeping in the kitchen. At that point, it comes out that the matriarch is the owner of the cottage at the back of the property. She\\u2019s been wanting to use her own cottage anyway. So she takes this shuffle as an opportunity to occupy her own cottage, which she\\u2019s happy about. Some of the family members are a little bit surprised that she\\u2019s already been sleeping in it, but they agree. I\\u2019m now down on the main floor, too. I put some things together in a bag because we have to go out to do laundry. I leave the house and go to my friend\\u2019s apartment building. There\\u2019s a line for the washing machine and the dryer. I wait. I go back up to his apartment, spend some time with his daughter, then go back down to check. This time I can put my laundry in. So I empty it out of the garbage bag. On the way back up to the apartment, there\\u2019s a strange man I find in the hallway. He asks me if I want some carrots. I don\\u2019t really know where I\\u2019m going to put them. I tell him I don\\u2019t have room for them right now. He says, \\u201cOkay, well I\\u2019ll find you later.\\u201d I go into the apartment. My friend\\u2019s daughter is still alone. So I\\u2019m playing a game with her and there\\u2019s a knock on the door. I open the door and it\\u2019s my friend. He kind of falls into the apartment. I wonder why he is knocking and not using his own key. I excuse myself and go back down to switch the laundry around. While I\\u2019m doing this, there\\u2019s a little bit of a fight in the laundry room and there are a couple of women that have been there since the beginning. They only want to use the dyers that they think they can use. They aren't letting other people use them. But I climb up on the table and put my stuff in the empty one later. They kind of give me a dirty look and huff off. While my laundry is in the dryer, the man comes in and gives me two carrots from the garden. He wants me to come out and look at the garden. It\\u2019s a community garden. I do, but I tell him I can only stay for a minute because I need to get my stuff out of the dryer as soon as it\\u2019s dry because there are two women in there who are going to probably pull it out and do something with it. While I\\u2019m outside and looking at the community garden, my phone rings. It\\u2019s my friend and he\\u2019s upstairs in the apartment. He tells me that I need to get back up there right away because there\\u2019s some kind of plot to oust him from the apartment. It\\u2019s something he hasn't done, but it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s fault - his name is Craig. He wants me to position myself on Craig\\u2019s floor and light a match because the draft that comes underneath his door will put the match out just at the right time and then the building supervisor will know it\\u2019s Craig\\u2019s fault and not my friend\\u2019s. I tell him I have to get the laundry first. So I run back into the laundry room. The two angry women are there and involved in some kind of fight with some other women. I get my laundry out and I rescue my suitcase from underneath the door to the laundry room and I put everything in it. I rush back upstairs onto the hallway where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I see my friend is coming out of the upper floor as I\\u2019m rushing in. I say, \\u201cOh, I was just putting myself in position there.\\u201d He says, \\u201cAh, it\\u2019s okay. I got somebody else to do it.\\u201d I just take my stuff up and put it in his apartment and wait there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Seven Centres\\u201d This dream starts at a wedding reception. I\\u2019m there with my daughter and my daughter's boyfriend. The reception probably holds about 50-60 people. The hall is big enough that it doesn\\u2019t feel crowded. There\\u2019s a certain amount of space between people. In fact, we are sitting at our own table. The table is bigger. There are lots of empty chairs. No one else is supposed to be sitting there. There are only three place settings - mine, my daughter\\u2019s and her guest. I\\u2019ve taken some time to do my hair before I go out. I\\u2019m wearing a silver tiara. It\\u2019s not fancy, it just wraps like a headband made of malleable silver wire. I\\u2019m using it to keep the hair from falling in front of my eyes if I tilt my head forward. I also have a multi-strand silver bracelet on my left wrist with tiny stones in it - they are opalesce in appearance. I\\u2019m wearing a light blue dress and it feels really good on my body. We\\u2019re having a conversation at the table. I excuse myself for a moment to use the restroom. On my way to the hall, this man comes up behind me. He\\u2019s fairly boisterous. I don't turn around to look at him. He\\u2019s trying to exert himself into my consciousness. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. After I come out of the restroom, I see him again. He\\u2019s sitting at a table with some other people. Again, he\\u2019s boisterous and loud, so he\\u2019s distracting. When i return to the table with my daughter and her boyfriend, he comes to sit with us. He\\u2019s trying to sell all of us on this idea that he makes some kind of chart that explores people\\u2019s personalities and lends them insights into themselves. I listen to him for a few minutes then decline his services. However, he leaves his business card. I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s located in Lindsay, a town I\\u2019m familiar with and know that I\\u2019m going to be visiting some time in the future. We finish our meal, the plates are taken away, and we are encouraged to stand up as the staff moves the table away to allow for dancing. We\\u2019re dancing as the same units as the table seating was arranged in. at one point, that same man comes up and just begins dancing. He\\u2019s fairly physical - really getting in my space and standing behind me and pressing his body up against mine and dancing with me. Then he leaves. There\\u2019s a point where the dance just goes on and on. It\\u2019s a lot of shaking, like ecstatic dance. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember the dance ending and us ending up at home in our beds. So when I wake up in the dream, I think, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really strange that we danced ourselves into this non-remembering place. I wonder how we got home?\\u201d We are home. Then I notice that the bracelet I had around my wrist is now in my hair. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a good idea, using it to tie the rest of my hair back so I can dance.\\u201d I go and look at it in the mirror and think, \\u201cOh, it even looks good. I like the way it looks.\\u201d When I leave the bathroom, I walk down the hall and notice that I am in the physical house of my step grandmother. I remember that there\\u2019s something I\\u2019m supposed to do when I\\u2019m here. I need to meet some of the people that were at the wedding reception the previous night. So, I organize myself. I get some breakfast. I have a shower and change my clothes. My daughter and her boyfriend don\\u2019t have to do these errands, so they\\u2019re staying in the living room. They\\u2019re occupied with some other activities. When I leave to go out the front door - it is winter time in the dream - I lock myself out. In order for my step-grandma to know I\\u2019m there and we\\u2019re in the house, I move one of the bricks from the garden and put it at the front door. Then I walk across the street to the neighbor\\u2019s house who is usually always home. They know each other. I knock on the door, she comes out and I tell her what I\\u2019ve done. She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I actually have a key. I\\u2019ll just let you in.\\u201d She walks back across the street with me, we open the door, I make sure it\\u2019s not locked this time, and say goodbye to her. She returns to her own house. I walk up the street. I turn right and I go to visit someone who still lives there. There are a number of family members standing in the driveway, having a conversation. I speak to the matriarch of the family and give her a hug. We have a conversation about what everyone is doing. After this conversation is over, I continue back up the street. There\\u2019s a little girl heading towards me. She\\u2019s only about two. I\\u2019m thinking she should not be out in the winter, she doesn\\u2019t even have a winter coat on. But I turn around and one of the people from the driveway exclaims, \\u201cOh, what are you doing? You\\u2019re supposed to still be in the house!\\u201d I realize it\\u2019s her own daughter. She goes up the street, picks up the little girl and is holding her. She says, \\u201cOh, I remember you. The last time I saw you, I was only 9 and you were with Daren\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh yes, I remember you.\\u201d I call her by name. She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s right. Why don\\u2019t you come in for a visit?\\u201d I agree to do that and tell her that I can only stay for a few minutes. We go into her house. It\\u2019s the house she grew up in and now it belongs to just her. She sets the little girl down, brushes her off and does the mom fingers through her hair thing. The little girl goes off to play. We sit down for a few minutes and she tells me what she\\u2019s doing. As we start to finish this conversation, another woman comes into the house whom I recognize, but I know she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. She\\u2019s lost a lot of weight and her face really looks different. I call her by name and she looks at me puzzled. I tell her who I am. She\\u2019s Daren\\u2019s youngest sister. She says, \\u201cOh, I really don't remember you, but I remember everybody else talking about you.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a bad thing. She just knows me from conversations but doesn\\u2019t remember me visually. We have a conversation. Then I tell her I have to get going and I have these errands to run. She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll walk with you. I\\u2019m going the same direction.\\u201d She tells me where she\\u2019s going and it\\u2019s the same man\\u2019s place with the business card. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, really? I\\u2019m surprised that anyone is interested in this.\\u201d She describes it as being very popular and he\\u2019s well-respected in this area where they all live. I think, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s on the way, maybe I\\u2019ll stop and see where his office is.\\u201d So, we do this. It\\u2019s snowing out. It\\u2019s really nice. I can feel the flakes landing on my face. It\\u2019s so cooling. Everything is just covered with this white magical veil. It\\u2019s just gorgeous. We walk to the end of the street and into this man\\u2019s office. It\\u2019s painted on the door. It looks like one of those 1940 detective show movies with the door with glass on top and name painted on the top like an arc and it has the \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d underneath. So, his name is painted in the shape of a rainbow. \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d is written vertically down and he\\u2019s got a picture of himself there. I\\u2019m laughing to myself because he\\u2019s wearing a turban and looks like a fake fortune teller. But there are other people waiting in line to see him and I\\u2019m astonished that people think this guy knows the future and all these deep secrets about them. I just can\\u2019t believe it. I also note that it\\u2019s progressed from the guy at the wedding reception handing out business cards, jollying it up with everyone, to now wearing a turban. His hair was short and grey. So the idea that he even needs a turban is ludicrous. So now I know where his office is and say goodbye to Daren\\u2019s sister. I carry on for my own errands. I go into a few shops. I\\u2019m just picking up small supplies. I go into a cheese shop and get a little tiny bit of cheese. I go into a meat shop and get a little bit of meat. Then I stop and get a few vegetables and fruit at the market. So I've got two bags in my arms and am walking back through the snow lined streets. There are no cars and nobody else walking. I can hear my feet crunching against the snow. I arrive back at my step-grandmother\\u2019s house. My daughter and her boyfriend are still in the living room. He\\u2019s doing something on a laptop and she\\u2019s doing something on a handheld device. I tell them that they need to come in and help prepare the food. I set it down and notice on the clock that there\\u2019s still two hours before we need to eat. I feel like I want to do something to keep occupied, but I don\\u2019t have anything else with me and it\\u2019s not my house. So, I go into the living room and sit down even though I know they\\u2019re both absorbed by their activities and me sitting there talking with them is not going to be welcomed. However, my daughter says to me, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you tell Joe what your dreams have been and he\\u2019ll record them on his laptop?\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cwhy would I do this? I already have my own dream journal at home?\\u201d But she\\u2019s looking at me the way you try to silently tell someone with your eyes: go, go, do it! So, I\\u2019m like okay, I guess this is meaningful, I\\u2019ll do it. So I say, \\u201cHey, do you want to record one of my dreams?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, sure.\\u201d I tell him this particular dream and I know it's\\u2019 got a number of parts to it. I peak over to see what he\\u2019s writing. He\\u2019s written two paragraphs and they\\u2019re not as detailed as I\\u2019m telling him. What\\u2019s fascinating is there\\u2019s a part on the screen where the words are turning into characters. So, for example, one of the words describing the wedding with the people seated around, but not saying anything are now flying but don\\u2019t have mouths. Some of the words are different colors. I look and I say, \\u201cOh my goodness! This is dream software. It\\u2019s animating my dream story!\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, isn\\u2019t it cool?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, this really is!\\u201d I ask him what it\\u2019s called and he tells me, but I don\\u2019t remember when I woke up. Then, he stops writing and he\\u2019s distracted and patting the cat\\u2019s head. He\\u2019s just recording this a lot more slowly than I can possibly speak. I feel myself getting a little frustrated that I want to get up and move, even though I\\u2019m fascinated by this software, I want to do something else while he\\u2019s not typing. So I get up and go into the kitchen. My daughter says, \\u201cDo you want him to finish or not?\\u201d I feel there\\u2019s an internal cognitive dissonance between wanting to finish and not wanting to sit there for the length of time it takes to do this. While I\\u2019m experiencing this cognitive dissonance, he gets tired of waiting for me to reply, leaves his chair and goes upstairs. Now I\\u2019m in the kitchen and thinking I might as well start prepping the vegetables. While I\\u2019m doing this, the doorbell rings and it\\u2019s this same man though he\\u2019s wearing a turban this time! He comes into the house and sits down in the living room. To my dismay, I see he\\u2019s already got my daughter sucked into his diagram of what he knows about her psyche and what he can predict from it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUgh!\\u201d So I think I should sit down and make sure I hear what he\\u2019s telling her so I can protect her from his lies. As I\\u2019m listening to him, I realize he\\u2019s using some points that have some validation in the world of psychology. I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s what he uses as a hook to get people to believe his ludicrous claims. And then he\\u2019s also using the same colors of the chakras from yoga and saying these are the 7 energetic centres that he works with. So he\\u2019s taken something from academic psychology and some hokey stuff and woven it through the chakras, but made himself the carrier of this information, so people have to pay him and go to his centre in order to receive his wisdom that actually isn\\u2019t even his, but something he\\u2019s whipped up from other people\\u2019s work.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Chandelier\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of building. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m teaching a teacher training, but it\\u2019s really different. The training is to help people connect to and expand their senses so that they have an expanded experience in their daily lives. I\\u2019m really enjoying using plants, food and light in the training. I\\u2019m fascinated by the process, actually. I teach every other weekend. On this particular weekend in May, May 23, I\\u2019m not supposed to be teaching. However, I have been borrowing things to use as equipment and examples - just gathering and borrowing rather than buying things to use in the teaching. This one friend of mine, Thomas has contributed something I can use in the training. He\\u2019s dropping it off athte facility where I teach as opposed to bringing it to my house. So I have to go in on my day off to meet him there. I am surprised that the doors are open and there seems to be another school going on. I\\u2019m just a little surprised because I was expecting it to be empty. But there\\u2019s another training of some sort involving children in one room and this is the room where I normally do my training. So I wait until there\\u2019s a little bit of a break and I wave to the person who is facilitating. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I just go over here and leave some stuff in the cupboard?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s no problem. You can join in if you want to.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you. It\\u2019s my day off. I just want to quickly drop this off and then I\\u2019ll be on my way.\\u201d But Thomas is not there yet. So I end up sitting off to the side and watch what she\\u2019s teaching. I think, \\u201cWow, that's a really different approach. I love the outside the box way she\\u2019s teaching the same old thing to these students.\\u201d I feel this curiosity for and respect for her teaching method. My friend arrives. He\\u2019s got a big cardboard box in his arms and says, \\u201cI need to assemble this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, well, let\\u2019s go into one of the empty rooms so we\\u2019re not bothering anyone else.\\u201d We exit out the backdoor of the first classroom. The next room, which I also expected to be empty wasn\\u2019t. Someone is in there setting up food. It\\u2019s a break room. He sets the cardboard box on the counter that has a sink at it. I say I\\u2019ll be back in a second. I go into the first room that I left because I\\u2019ve left some bags in there. As I'm collecting them, I look out the windows and see that some of the plants I normally use have been crushed. Something has stepped on them. I\\u2019m wanting to preserve them, so I need a bucket or something I can use to dig them up and put them in so I can wash off the roots and put them in fresh soil. I ask the first teacher if she has anything. She says, \\u201cNo, but there might be something in the kitchen.\\u201d So now I\\u2019ve got the plants in my hands. I\\u2019m holding onto them and I can feel how delicate the roots are when they\\u2019re not supported with the soil. There\\u2019s a little bit of urgency for me needing to find a container for them. I go back into the break room. The woman who was setting up has got a really, really big heavy urn, like 3 feet by 2 feet. It\\u2019s some kind of elaborate tea and coffee maker. My friend is helping her set them up instead of assembling what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. She looks like she\\u2019s finished now. Everything is stacked up. I ask her if I can use one of the plastic cups for my plants and I show her that they need some support and I need to put them in soil or they\\u2019re going to die. She says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t give you one of these. They\\u2019re all counted for. If I give you one of these, then someone will have to go without a cup of tea.\\u201d She says that maybe there is something in one of the cupboards. I\\u2019m looking through the cupboards and can\\u2019t find anything yet. I\\u2019m starting to feel like my whole day off is becoming consumed by this task. I ask Thomas if he can expedite putting together what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. He seems to be getting distracted by all the other activities and people. He says, \\u201cOkay, yes. I\\u2019ll assemble it now.\\u201d I go back into the first room and show the facilitator. She is sitting and leaning against the wall while the rest of her students are busy with activities. I show her the plants and ask her if she has a container I can put them in. She reaches underneath, opens one of the cupboard doors and gets a container and gives it to me. Now I\\u2019ve got them in a container, so their leaves won\\u2019t get crushed. But I still don\\u2019t have any soil. At this point, Thomas comes out of the back door and he\\u2019s assembled what he brought. It is 5 feet wide. He\\u2019s holding it at the top kind of like someone would hold a mobile. But it\\u2019s not a mobile. It\\u2019s a light. The light is made of tiny copper wires - they\\u2019re really quite delicate and it\\u2019s beautiful. They expand outwards and then downwards. The downward links of wire are all different lengths. Every 4 or 5 inches there\\u2019s a tiny light. So it\\u2019s a very beautiful, wide light. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to get this home now that it's assembled?\\u201d He\\u2019s carrying it. Then, he asks me what it\\u2019s for. I start explaining to him. I\\u2019m feeling obligated to teach a little of what I\\u2019m using this network of light for in the training. I start telling him. One of my own students who looks like she\\u2019s just woken up from a nap comes out of another room and says, \\u201cOh, did we have school today?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, no, we don\\u2019t.\\u201d Then I see another one coming and she\\u2019s asking if she\\u2019s missed out on any content. I say, \\u201cNo I was just telling Thomas this.\\u201d Then I realize I need to stop. Now it\\u2019s turning into a day\\u2019s teaching and it\\u2019s supposed to be my day off. So I tell them, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019ll cover this next Sunday. Don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d They go back their own way. I tell Thomas, \\u201cI really need to get this home. It\\u2019s almost 3 o\\u2019clock and I want to have some time to myself.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m carrying the little plant in the container. He\\u2019s gingerly carrying the really wide delicate light chandelier. We exit the building and go into the parking lot. He\\u2019s got a motorcycle and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this safely on a motorcycle? I didn\\u2019t realize that was his mode of transportation.\\u201d I say out loud, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this light on the motorcycle?\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, it will be fine.\\u201d He puts it along the inside of the passenger seat, which has a curved arm and back. He says, \\u201cYou can just lean against it there.\\u201d I do. I swing my leg over and sit on the passenger seat. Now I\\u2019ve got the plant in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to protect it with my body. I\\u2019m trying not to crush the light. He gets on the motorcycle, starts it up and begins to drive really fast. I\\u2019m having a hard time hanging onto the plant. Now i look down and one of my cats is in my arms. He\\u2019s all tense and he\\u2019s trying to jump off. I\\u2019m terrified that he will because he\\u2019s really wiry and he\\u2019s big and I\\u2019ve got this plant in one hand. I\\u2019m afraid he\\u2019s going to get crushed on the highway. So, Thomas takes one of his hands off the handle of the bike and is also holding onto the cat. I can see the cat\\u2019s claw is cutting into his arm and he\\u2019s bleeding. I ask him, \\u201cCan we please pull over and arrange this so that the cat is being held firmly by someone and everything else is protected?\\u201d He does. I get a better grip of the cat and have the plant under the other arm. He starts the bike up again. I think, \\u201cWow, I hope I can hang onto this and everyone is okay until we get home.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cStep-Motherhood\\u201d This dream I seem to be a step-mother to two different families. It starts off and I\\u2019m actually unclear on whether I am the first group of kids\\u2019 actual mother or if I\\u2019m their stepmom, but I\\u2019ve been with them for some time. There\\u2019s three boys and a girl. We do live alone. There\\u2019s no man in the house. The boys are all teenagers and they\\u2019re very close in age, like 17, 16 and 15. The girl is a little bit younger, but also a teenager, perhaps 12 or 13. They\\u2019re all in various stages of self-sufficiency and they are aware that we need to be moving soon as I am. Then the scene switches a little bit and I\\u2019m at another house. The house is actually quite spectacular. It\\u2019s a farmhouse style that has had a lot of work done to modernize it and continue to hold its beauty. It\\u2019s not in a town, but there are a few other houses around. It feels like some other people have also chosen not to live in an urban setting and are perhaps because of their own independence, wanting to live off the land and make similar choices, they may be in the early stages of a rural community. But I don\\u2019t feel that it\\u2019s happened quite yet. You can just see that there are other landowners around. The house has a big wide decking around it so you can stand on it before entering. It also feels like it adds to the safety and the way the house is heated and cooled by night and day through this deck and the roof. It\\u2019s like a wide, deep and covered porch. The roof is tiled. The kitchen is interesting, too. There\\u2019s a fireplace in the very center. There\\u2019s a big big wide beam that splits the kitchen in half at the ceiling. The table is built to hug the fireplace and wrap around it in a C-shape. I also notice the water tank attached to the fireplace. I haven\\u2019t quite figured out how it heats the water in the kitchen, but it does. The dream begins with me. I\\u2019m at the table. There are four girls and one boy. The boy is the oldest, probably 11 or 12. The youngest girl is still a baby, maybe 1, possibly 10 or 11 months old. The mom isn\\u2019t there. I\\u2019m not clear if she died or if she left, but she\\u2019s just not there. But she must have been there recently because the youngest is really young. I\\u2019m supposed to be getting to know these kids. I\\u2019m having a hard time keeping their names straight because there are so many of them and they never sit still for very long. The dad is there at the moment. He\\u2019s asked me to bathe them. There\\u2019s a system set up with a pipe that runs up from the fireplace, across the ceiling, down into the room that\\u2019s the bathroom and into the bathtub faucet. I open up the spigot that releases some of that water and am carefully mixing the cool water with the hot water, putting my hand in there and I only fill it about 3 or 4 inches because the little girl is very young. Then I pick her up from the dinner table and take her into the bathroom. At this point, I really get to see her face. She\\u2019s this bundle of joy. She\\u2019s innocent. She\\u2019s happy - you can feel the bubbles of happiness radiating out from her body and she\\u2019s completely trusting of me. Now I can remember her name because I can feel her energy and see her face. So I take her clothes off and I set her gently in the tub and am starting to wash her. The dad comes in and checks on us. He says something to me, but I don\\u2019t know what it is, then he leaves the room. I take the little one out of the bathtub and dry her off. I wrap her in the towel and go back into the kitchen. The dad is there. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s not clearly outlined. I see that he\\u2019s at the sink washing dishes. The kids are rowdy as they sit around the table because no one is really with them and they\\u2019re finished eating. Food is still on the table. I get the next oldest daughter who is a little over 2. I take her by the hand and bring her into the bathroom. Then I put the little one back in. she\\u2019s sitting safely in the bathtub. Then I tell the next youngest one: \\u201cWe might as well get you ready so that you can have the next bath.\\u201d I see her face and she looks different from the first child. She\\u2019s quite a bit darker and has a different character. I can feel how energetically different this child is from the first one. She\\u2019s not as trusting. She\\u2019s a lot more independent. We get her sweater off and her top and her shirt and her shoes and socks. Then I think this is going to be a challenge. The bath water from the first one is still quite clear. The other one didn\\u2019t have anything on her - there were no food bits or dirt. So the bath water is still clean and I think I\\u2019ll just warm it up a little bit and add some bubbles, then put the next daughter in. I do this. Now I\\u2019ve got both of them in the bath at the same time. I\\u2019m washing the second one. The second one has hair so I\\u2019m rinsing it with clear water from the tap. I realize that now the water is going to get too deep for the baby. I take her out and wrap her in her towel again and put her on the floor beside me. I think, \\u201cOkay, how am I going to do this? There are still three more kids to have baths. Who\\u2019s going to look after the first two?\\u201d Then the dad comes in and I\\u2019m relieved. I tell him that the youngest one is finished. He takes her with him. I finish bathing the second daughter. He brings in the third one and leaves her at the door. I coax her in. She\\u2019s a little more standoffish and it\\u2019s taking some time for me to talk to her. Then the scene changes from the bathroom. I\\u2019m outside with them. I\\u2019m showing them a raised garden bed that belongs to me. So I know what\\u2019s in there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, this starts as a seed. See how it hasn\\u2019t grown up yet? It will soon if we water it and give it some sunlight.\\u201d I hand them a watering can and they pour some water on it. Then I say, \\u201cLook, this one is already grown! It already has some fronds on it.\\u201d I clip off two fronds and say, \\u201cHere, rub the leaves a little bit and then smell it.\\u201d They do. It\\u2019s lavender. They really like this and both of them are smiling now. They\\u2019re happy and engaged with the garden. I ask them if they want to bring in this and put it in the bath water. They say yes. Now they\\u2019re both excited. So we go back into the house and back into the bathroom. Now those two are bathed. I changed the water when we got back in. They\\u2019re playing happily in the bathroom with me. It\\u2019s fine. They don\\u2019t need the kind of support the 1-year-old did where you had to hold her and do everything else with one hand. They\\u2019re playing together on the bathroom floor. I change the bath water and put in fresh bubbles. I put them both in the bathtub at the same time and wash their hair. I take them out and dry them off. I\\u2019m wondering where the dad is. I go out to the kitchen. The older girl and the boy are not at the table, but the dishes have all been taken away and the table is clean. So i\\u2019m wondering where to go next with them. I go the opposite way of the bathroom. There\\u2019s a large living room with a fireplace. It\\u2019s sunken a little bit and there are bedrooms off to the side. The girls just run into their own room. I think, \\u201cOh, this is where they sleep.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m a nanny or what. I\\u2019m starting to feel more like a nanny, like a governess. So I help them put their pajamas on, put them into bed, read them a story, and say goodnight. Then I come out and the dad has put the baby to bed. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019ve got a little bit of a breather here. The older kids can bathe themselves. Then just make sure they go to bed.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, got it.\\u201d Then I go back into the bathroom because I still have to clean up from the older twos\\u2019 bathing. I pull the plug. The dad comes up behind me and gives me a big hug from the back. I can feel his heart rate and his breath. There\\u2019s heat between us. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s what this is? Am I stepmom?\\u201d I feel a little confused. The heat is really good and I can feel my body responding. I soften into him and allow this. It lasts for a moment, then he releases me and leaves the room. Then he\\u2019s gone from the house and I get the idea that he works nights. I let the older two know that the bathroom is clean and they come in and do their own thing. I\\u2019m not witness to this. Then they\\u2019re in their pajamas and are sitting in the living room. Now we\\u2019re having a conversation with my own kids from the previous family where I was mother or step-mother or nanny. They are all sitting around. My kids from the first group are older. The kids are deciding whose room is going to be whose and who has to double up. They\\u2019re having this independent conversation. It seems to be working out. Now there\\u2019s a top floor to this house overtop the living room. That\\u2019s where the rest of the bedrooms are. So they work it out. All of them go to bed up there. Now the dream speeds up in time. I am looking after all of these kids by myself. I\\u2019m making their meals, we\\u2019re doing some kind of life skills activities during the day involving the garden and teaching them how to cook. There\\u2019s water that needs to be filled up in this complex system of rainwater catchment that\\u2019s heated by the fireplace and dispersed. Some of the girls are filtering the water and putting it in quart-sized containers for drinking water. It feels as though I have done this for about 10 days, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, how long is the dad\\u2019s night shifts?\\u201d I see him one morning. The kids are all happy to see him. Now there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference between the first group of kids and the ones that were clearly his. I say to him, \\u201cHow many more night shifts do you have?\\u201d He says, two. I say, \\u201cOh good. I was really hoping for some help here.\\u201d He has a bag of photography equipment in his hand and he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s picture day.\\u201d At this point I realize we need a backdrop. I\\u2019m tasked with going to the hardware store to get one. There\\u2019s a truck and I drive to the hardware store and get out. There\\u2019s this great big huge rack of backdrops. It\\u2019s like 8 feet long and 5 feet high. I choose one and am wondering how to get it out to the door without bending it. The employee appears to help me. She says she\\u2019s already rang it through. It doesn\\u2019t seem possible, but I take it out of the rack and it goes through the door and into the truck. It just fits. I get back to the farmhouse and take it out. Now I\\u2019m tacking it to the side of the house. Now there\\u2019s a piece of stucco ceiling. We\\u2019re outside. We\\u2019re getting ready to take pictures of the kids. He thinks the younger ones are going to be difficult, but they just come up and they\\u2019re happy. He says, \\u201cHow did you get them to do that together?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well we have this garden. I\\u2019ve got a garden in the back and we\\u2019ve been growing things. They really like it.\\u201d So the kids automatically go and get the herbs I showed them. They pick their favorites and bring them over. Then, click, click, click, the pictures are all taken and it\\u2019s really easy. Then the dad is finally next. It\\u2019s his turn. He\\u2019s lying on his back with his knees bent. I say, \\u201cOh just a second. I\\u2019ve got a kit for that in my car.\\u201d I go out and get it. They are small pieces of carpet I\\u2019ve cut out especially to cushion heads and sacrums. There are just two. I tell him to lift up his head and I put one under there. Then I tell him to lift his sacrum and I put one under there. Then I\\u2019ve got something different for the background. It\\u2019s made of some kind of fabric. I\\u2019ve got a tin of thumbtacks. I\\u2019m trying to push the thumbtacks into the wall. But just as I get to the end, the first one falls out. So he gets up and tacks it, only he uses the ceiling instead of the wall. I say, \\u201cOh, how did you do that?\\u201d He shows me the end of the tack. I see that it\\u2019s one of those things to replace Christmas ornaments - they come off and you can buy a package of separate ones. He has these in the tack instead and they fit into the ceiling. So I put one on mine and it goes into the ceiling like butter. I\\u2019m surprised. It works. Just as I\\u2019m about to turn around and go back to the camera, there he is behind me and there\\u2019s all this heat. I\\u2019m not going to go into detail, but we make beautiful love. Then all these other images go through my mind. It feels like in this whole dream sequence that he\\u2019s wanted me to fit in and I do, and now there\\u2019s all this sexual energy and love released from him and between us.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Time Machine\\u201d This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There\\u2019s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house\\u2019s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it\\u2019s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I\\u2019m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it\\u2019s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, \\u201cI have to take this.\\u201d He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he\\u2019s in the kitchen, although I haven\\u2019t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He\\u2019s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, \\u201cHe left you a gift.\\u201d I feel sad. I also feel like I don\\u2019t want to be alone with her. I\\u2019m starting to wonder how I\\u2019m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I\\u2019m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I\\u2019m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there\\u2019s a really strong emotion. It\\u2019s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that\\u2019s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn\\u2019t appear and I knew it wouldn\\u2019t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I\\u2019m an adult now. I\\u2019m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it\\u2019s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don\\u2019t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I\\u2019m hoping they\\u2019ll still be there when I leave. I\\u2019m glad he still hasn\\u2019t returned to England and I\\u2019ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I\\u2019m confused because I can\\u2019t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it\\u2019s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they\\u2019re in charge: \\u201cDo you know what happened to the classrooms?\\u201d She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, \\u201cDo you know this one is out of date?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, no I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, you\\u2019ll need to go down to the office.\\u201d She tells me the number of the office and says, \\u201cYou need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They\\u2019re just saying hello and stuff and I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren\\u2019s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on asphalt in a really old town. I\\u2019m part of a play. It\\u2019s like a movie set, but it\\u2019s not a movie set, it\\u2019s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I\\u2019ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It\\u2019s white and about 12 inches square - it\\u2019s a cube. They put this in between each word. It\\u2019s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that\\u2019s describing this tells me, \\u201cYes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they\\u2019ve been forgotten.\\u201d He told me the one we\\u2019re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there\\u2019s a picnic table. We\\u2019re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we\\u2019re waiting. It\\u2019s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it\\u2019s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They\\u2019re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn\\u2019t have food, though. He has sewing. I\\u2019m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don\\u2019t even know what it is - I choose that one. I\\u2019m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it\\u2019s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we\\u2019re entering this vehicle. It\\u2019s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but I think it\\u2019s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it\\u2019s got some kind of engine - it\\u2019s not very loud; it\\u2019s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we\\u2019re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,\\u201dWe\\u2019re going out this way.\\u201d I watch them and am thinking, \\u201cOh my god! They\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d They\\u2019re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fun House\\u201d We are at a carnival. It\\u2019s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I\\u2019m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don\\u2019t really want to because I know they aren\\u2019t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they\\u2019re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she\\u2019s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that\\u2019s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I\\u2019ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They\\u2019re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She\\u2019s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it\\u2019s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We\\u2019re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there\\u2019s a door. It brings us into something we\\u2019re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We\\u2019re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don\\u2019t have the shoes on because I\\u2019m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they\\u2019re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn\\u2019t make me put the shoes on. I\\u2019m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she\\u2019s glaring at me, I also retort, \\u201cWould I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.\\u201d I think I said Christian, but I can\\u2019t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she\\u2019s moved back and I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good. Maybe she won\\u2019t bother me anymore.\\u201d On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a window, but it\\u2019s close to the ground - it\\u2019s a crawlspace. She\\u2019s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She\\u2019s looking at something on the other side. I don\\u2019t feel like crawling there. I can see that she\\u2019s jumping up and down. She\\u2019s excited about what she sees, so I\\u2019m content to sit on the other side and wait until she\\u2019s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it\\u2019s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she\\u2019s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It\\u2019s dark. We don\\u2019t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it\\u2019s dissonant. It\\u2019s really unpleasant. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.\\u201d So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it\\u2019s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he\\u2019s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She\\u2019s a naturopath. She\\u2019s there with Trisha. i wonder what they\\u2019re doing because the carnival doesn\\u2019t seem like their thing. I\\u2019m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d Instead of staying on the ground, we\\u2019re suddenly transported upwards a little. I\\u2019d say we\\u2019re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They\\u2019re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they\\u2019re ants and they\\u2019re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He\\u2019s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he\\u2019s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn\\u2019t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Airport\\u201d We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I\\u2019m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I\\u2019ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian\\u2019s house and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we\\u2019ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it\\u2019s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She\\u2019s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn\\u2019t hungry and it\\u2019s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she\\u2019s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she\\u2019s done this in a bowl before she\\u2019s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband\\u2019sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it\\u2019s like glue. Some of it\\u2019s hard and some is still soft. It\\u2019s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don\\u2019t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, \\u201ceww,\\u201d when I\\u2019m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She\\u2019s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, \\u201cWhat time did the tickets say we\\u2019re supposed to be there?\\u201d She says, \\u201c5 o\\u2019clock in the morning.\\u201d But she says it in metric first, but we don\\u2019t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, \\u201cAre you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o\\u2019clock.\\u201d So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o\\u2019clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it\\u2019s almost that time. He\\u2019s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he\\u2019s getting his clothes on and I\\u2019m putting things into the suitcase. We\\u2019re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, \\u201cNope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.\\u201d Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, \\u201cOh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I\\u2019ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We\\u2019ll still be there in lots of time.\\u201d Her husband says no, I don\\u2019t want you to do that. Besides, we\\u2019re just going into the US and you don\\u2019t need passports anymore.\\u201d But I tell them, \\u201cEvery time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.\\u201d He gets out a piece of paper that\\u2019s attached to the back of his driver\\u2019s license. He says, \\u201cHere, read the fine print.\\u201d I read down and it says it\\u2019s fine to go on with just a driver\\u2019s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver\\u2019s license with me. I say, \\u201cBut my son doesn\\u2019t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, \\u201cWell now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.\\u201d But he won\\u2019t let us go. He tells us all it\\u2019s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They\\u2019re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don\\u2019t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn\\u2019t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We\\u2019re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don\\u2019t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I\\u2019m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don\\u2019t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she\\u2019s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re over at Gate such and such.\\u201d So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they\\u2019ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that\\u2019s great, although I\\u2019m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don\\u2019t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Birthday Party\\u201d I\\u2019m at a house and the occasion is my friend\\u2019s birthday. She\\u2019s 50 on this birthday, although I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s her real age. It\\u2019s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don\\u2019t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I\\u2019m looking for someone I know. I\\u2019m reluctant to go into the house. I\\u2019ve arrived there with my son. He\\u2019s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don\\u2019t know. I have an eye on him. He\\u2019s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I\\u2019m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I\\u2019m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn\\u2019t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He\\u2019s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they\\u2019ve seen him. They say, \\u201cYes, he went down that hallway.\\u201d They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He\\u2019s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he\\u2019ll get dressed and I tell him we\\u2019re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he\\u2019s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It\\u2019s not about anything I care to converse about. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are we wearing today\\u201d - flat and doesn\\u2019t feel meaningful. I sit with them for a few minutes and then go back to the washroom where my son is. He\\u2019s dressed now. I take him by the hand and we start walking down the hallway and out. I notice for the whole duration of this dream, my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. As we\\u2019re leaving her house, I see a pair of plastic shorts. They\\u2019re kind of long - they go almost down to the top of the knee. There\\u2019s a perforated line where you can rip off the last 4 inches and make them into a normal length pair of shorts. For some reason, I pick them up and I do this. I fold at the perforated line and rip off the bottom 4 inches. Then I roll them up and am looking for a bag to put them in. I notice there\\u2019s a tag on them that says Size 10. I think, \\u201cWhose are these?\\u201d Then I\\u2019m looking for my friend to give them to. I look down in my hand and suddenly I also have a birthday card. Now I feel surprised that I appear to have picked up something in her house that doesn\\u2019t belong to me - a pair of transparent plastic shorts - and now I\\u2019m going to give them to her. I don\\u2019t want to because I feel like I haven\\u2019t purchased this fairly; I\\u2019ve just picked them up and taken them. It\\u2019s not even something I would give to her. I\\u2019m looking for a place to set these down. They just disappear out of my hand. Now I\\u2019m with my son on the outside of the house. I take him by the hand and we continue on our walk. We go all the way around the block - it\\u2019s a nice walk. When we come back, there are still all these people I don\\u2019t know. I feel like I don\\u2019t belong there. I\\u2019m relieved to see her husband isn\\u2019t there. She\\u2019s sitting on the porch. I go up to tell her we\\u2019re going and maybe I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow when there aren\\u2019t so many people around. She smiles at me. I smile back. I get in the car with my son and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cOjai\\u201d The only part of the dream I remember comes after something traumatic. I\\u2019m feeling those emotions, but can\\u2019t remember what precipitated. It\\u2019s like I have some kind of amnesia that\\u2019s just gradually coming back throughout the meal I can recall in the dream. The meal is situated in Ojai where I did all my yoga teacher training. Except it\\u2019s not at the Piazza. It\\u2019s at the Casita. I\\u2019m in a large kitchen. I\\u2019m sitting at the table by myself. I\\u2019m feeling like no one wants to talk to me and if I do speak, my voice won\\u2019t be heard. I feel invalidated. The food preparation which is normally shared is not even being shared this day. The food is brought in various containers, some of which appear to be styrofoam. I feel let down by that. I feel like the lack of community preparation and resorting to calling for takeout in a non-sustainable container is showing me that this is not what I\\u2019m here for. I was here for authentic community sharing. I feel duped that the community meal is actually a takeout. Now Lana is opening up all the containers and dividing each container pretty much evenly onto 16 plates. There are quite a few containers, probably 20. She looks mindless while she\\u2019s doing this and is doing it hurriedly with her hands. Once all the plates are ready, people just come and take one. They\\u2019re not even sitting at the table. They are taking their plate and going off to some other area by themselves. I don\\u2019t go. I notice that about 10 plates are gone. Then I get mine. I didn\\u2019t even realize people had started helping themselves. So I take one and sit down at the table. My teacher sits down beside me as though he\\u2019s expecting everyone to also be at the table because he sits down right beside me the way you would sit down at a table when you\\u2019re expecting it to be full. I\\u2019m already eating my food. He\\u2019s silent. He eats a few bites then asks where everybody is. I tell him I don\\u2019t know. He seems concerned about this. He gets up and moves a little bit away, giving me some space. Then he\\u2019s looking around. What it does is it creates the feeling for me that the students are acting as a group within a group. We\\u2019re all here to learn from him. We\\u2019re all trainees. But in this scene, he\\u2019s no longer the teacher, at least not for what has happened in our network. It\\u2019s fragmented and it feels like there is some clandestine activity going on.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Curio Shop\\u201d My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I\\u2019m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It\\u2019s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can\\u2019t even see what\\u2019s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don\\u2019t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We\\u2019re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They\\u2019re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we\\u2019ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It\\u2019s purple, but it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s blue. It\\u2019s got fur all over. The fur doesn\\u2019t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there\\u2019s this creature in the store and my son\\u2019s got him. I don\\u2019t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they\\u2019re half off, they\\u2019re still really expensive and I don\\u2019t think I need a spoon that badly. I don\\u2019t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I\\u2019m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s this one.\\u201d I still think it\\u2019s expensive and say I don\\u2019t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my son?\\u201d One of the male shopkeepers says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to follow me.\\u201d So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d and it just bursts out of my body. I\\u2019m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it\\u2019s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I\\u2019m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that\\u2019s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, \\u201cNo way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!\\u201d So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, \\u201cRun! We have to get out of here!\\u201d So we start running. I don\\u2019t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We\\u2019re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can\\u2019t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s go in there. There are other people.\\u201d The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, \\u201cLet\\u2019s change our clothes, \\u201c so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He\\u2019s right there. I tell him, \\u201cYour partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can\\u2019t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.\\u201d He\\u2019s not helpful. In fact, he\\u2019s in league with the other one. So now we\\u2019re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can\\u2019t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got my son! You\\u2019re holding him and I want him back.\\u201d Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, \\u201cFine fine, okay!\\u201d He writes this phone number down. I say, \\u201cA phone number?! Are you kidding me?!\\u201d I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I\\u2019ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I\\u2019m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It\\u2019s a 10-digit number. Now I\\u2019ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It\\u2019s like 164576476470, like that. The 4\\u2019s and 7\\u2019s won\\u2019t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I\\u2019m sobbing and saying, \\u201cJust tell me where he is. Just go get him.\\u201d One of them says he\\u2019s in the basement. \\u201cThe basement of this building?!\\u201d I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m trying to get back into the dream, but I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"\\u201cJack\\u201d This is just a snippet. I am with my daughter and some other person that\\u2019s male - I think it might be Kenny - and Jack who is a friend of mine that I\\u2019ve had since elementary school and I still keep in contact with him. We\\u2019re supposed to be picking Jack up because he\\u2019s agreed to help us with something. He keeps not being where he said he would be. So the three of us are running around from spot to spot looking for him. It\\u2019s an urban setting and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are very slushy and it\\u2019s hard to get through. We\\u2019re muddy. As we get to checkpoints where we\\u2019re supposed to meet him, he\\u2019s not there. Now I\\u2019m not with my daughter. I don\\u2019t know what happened to her. In fact, Jack is supposed to be looking after her. It\\u2019s muddy what his responsibilities are and if he\\u2019s actually looking after them. The other two people are going through these convolutedWell, we don\\u2019t have his phone number.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well I do.\\u201d So I get out my cell phone and I look. Someone has changed his last name, but I know it\\u2019s his number because I know where it is in my contacts. When I press his number, what comes up is not his name, but something completely different that starts with D-H-L and then this other name. I think, \\u201cThat\\u2019s odd. How can anybody have done this in my phone?\\u201d Then I look over and I see him, but he looks like he\\u2019s sleeping. He\\u2019s oblivious to his surroundings. As I walk over to say hey what's up, he disappears. Then I go back to the other two people. We\\u2019ve been looking for him because he\\u2019s supposed to be doing something with us. I\\u2019m trying to explain that I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on here and something is going on with my phone and he\\u2019s illusive.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Night Walk\\u201d This dream starts in a house that\\u2019s mine. It\\u2019s a different kind of house - open concept. It\\u2019s two levels. There is a lot of space in the rooms. There aren\\u2019t a lot of contents in each room. I cook something for supper. It\\u2019s some kind of pasta with weird sauce. There\\u2019s this piece of chicken with breading on it. My conscious mind is thinking, \\u201cEw, I never make food like that.\\u201d The pasta is kind of dry and so is the chicken. I don\\u2019t make things with breading. I eat a little bit of supper and don\\u2019t really like it. I take about three bites and leave it. I tell my child - the child is a mixture of my son and daughter at the same time - we\\u2019re going to go for a walk after supper. It needs to be dark, so we are waiting until it gets dark. We leave out the house. I had something in my hand. The walk is down a path. We go out first through a field and then through an opening in some rocks which we go underneath. Then there is a fork and I say we need to take the path on the left. We climb up a steep ascent and navigate that. Then there\\u2019s a ridge to follow along. There\\u2019s a vista here before we climb up. Suddenly it zooms out and you can see how vast this landscape is - it\\u2019s like an escarpment and really quite beautiful. Then it zooms back in and we\\u2019re standing there. It\\u2019s a long hike. So we hike for probably half the night. I have this feeling in my body where it\\u2019s a tiny bit scary. But I have my child with me and I don\\u2019t want to communicate my own fear to my child. So I do quite well at appearing brave and courageous. The landscape is very pretty even in the night. There\\u2019s a feeling of lush. It feels Canadian with a mix of evergreen, deciduous trees. It\\u2019s cool, but not too cold or too hot. I can feel the packed dirt underneath my feet. It\\u2019s not too overgrown. It\\u2019s not a very wide path, so some of the grasses have grown into it. But you can still see the path ahead, so we aren\\u2019t night blind. There is enough light from the moon and the stars that we can see the path. So we hike and we get tired and our legs start to get a little bit sore. I say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s turn around and go back now.\\u201d So we do. We navigate exactly backwards. It\\u2019s uneventful. Nothing comes after us. There\\u2019s no need to run or hasten our pace. We arrive back at the house and I realize that whatever I had in my hand, I left there. So, my child sleeps, but I don\\u2019t. I leave the house and I meet someone else at a marina - it\\u2019s a complex of houses where people live. I\\u2019m meeting some friends there. There are lawn chairs set up in a circle. It\\u2019s an uncomfortable baby shower where people sit around in a circle talking stiffly in awkward small talk. There\\u2019s some kind of party game going on. One of the people grabs me by the hands and pulls me into the middle of the circle. I\\u2019m to stand there and grab the hands of two other people, then we lean back until there\\u2019s tension in the arms. Then that\\u2019s it. We stand back upright, let go, go back into our chairs. I wait and watch a few other people do the same kind of party trick. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhen is this thing going to be over?\\u201d One by one, people start to leave. I don\\u2019t linger. Then I\\u2019m caught by one of the people I know. She says, \\u201cCome on, we have to go visit my mom. She\\u2019s in one of these houses.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll do that.\\u201d As we enter into the house, I realize it\\u2019s another baby shower of some sort. There are bits of blue decoration - like the tissue paper kind - and blue balloons stuck to the wall. Finger foods have been set out everywhere. The mom stands up when she sees me, but then she tips over to one side. I realize that she\\u2019s had way too much to drink. In fact, she seems to have had more to drink than she seems to be aware of. She doesn\\u2019t seem to realize she\\u2019s staggering and banging into furniture. I feel compassion for her. I also hope she\\u2019ll sit down. She does. She still has this loopy unchanging happy smile on her face throughout this. It\\u2019s an unwavering expression. The rest of the people aren\\u2019t really engaging with each other. I get up and slowly back away out of the room and out the front door. I leave and go back to my house. I\\u2019m walking. It\\u2019s a fairly long walk and by the time I get there, it\\u2019s morning. My child wakes up. There\\u2019s this same dried pasta with a piece of chicken still in the pot. It\\u2019s in the exact same condition as it was the night before. Now it\\u2019s nighttime again. I tell my child that I forgot something on the walk and we need to do it again. Only this time, there\\u2019s not that same little bit of adrenaline going through my body where I feel slightly scared. We go through exactly the same steps to go on the walk. It\\u2019s dark, it\\u2019s at night. I wake up before I retrieve whatever it is that I left there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fortune Teller\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It\\u2019s summer. It\\u2019s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It\\u2019s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I\\u2019m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I\\u2019m with some friends. I can\\u2019t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt. She\\u2019s in the boat that I\\u2019m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She\\u2019s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I\\u2019ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who\\u2019s driving the boat is not me. It\\u2019s a motorboat - something I don\\u2019t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I\\u2019m hazy on one that is - it\\u2019s not water skiing, it\\u2019s not floating, I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we\\u2019re staying. I guess I\\u2019m in a motel because it\\u2019s on the ground. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I\\u2019m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It\\u2019s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it\\u2019s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There\\u2019s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it\\u2019s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I\\u2019ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there\\u2019s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They\\u2019ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that\\u2019s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she\\u2019s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she\\u2019s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she\\u2019s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that\\u2019s complete. So they\\u2019re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life\\u2019s purpose. I\\u2019m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I\\u2019m really surprised that she\\u2019s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there\\u2019s somebody ahead of me. I don\\u2019t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don\\u2019t go in with her and I haven\\u2019t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she\\u2019s advertised. I don\\u2019t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She\\u2019s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She\\u2019s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she\\u2019s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they\\u2019re laughing like, \\u201cWow! I can\\u2019t imagine myself doing this!\\u201d Or \\u201cI\\u2019m so surprised at what she said!\\u201d These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They\\u2019re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it\\u2019s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it\\u2019s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren\\u2019t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I\\u2019m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She\\u2019s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It\\u2019s a woman I know. I\\u2019m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life\\u2019s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there\\u2019s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she\\u2019s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives. She says, \\u201cWow I\\u2019ve made $350 doing this.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a \\u201cwho knew?!\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou are making this up?\\u201d She\\u2019s speaking as though she\\u2019s making it up. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Inner City\\u201d In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It\\u2019s really hot. There\\u2019s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I\\u2019m inside a building. It\\u2019s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I\\u2019m helping people. I don\\u2019t know the people I\\u2019m working with. So I\\u2019m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It\\u2019s really oddly shaped. It\\u2019s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It\\u2019s covered with sticky potato. I think it\\u2019s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there\\u2019s this big hose thing that\\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. It\\u2019s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I\\u2019m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there\\u2019s a sieve thing on it. I\\u2019m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they\\u2019re moving really fast. They\\u2019re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She\\u2019s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I\\u2019m helping. I feel like she\\u2019s centered me out as though I\\u2019m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn\\u2019t up to par. It\\u2019s a whole demeanor like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to watch you even closer.\\u201d She\\u2019s making me nervous now. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I\\u2019m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They\\u2019re trying to speed up and they\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can\\u2019t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There\\u2019s a ramp and there\\u2019s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I\\u2019ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I\\u2019m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don\\u2019t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I\\u2019m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They\\u2019re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She\\u2019s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there\\u2019s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t she put the bigger rock that\\u2019s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?\\u201d Now I notice that she\\u2019s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she\\u2019s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She\\u2019s calling the thigh bone a \\u201cfemoris\\u201d but in a sing-song type voice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cUh, no!\\u201d But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, \\u201cI wonder if they knew she was in there?\\u201d I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We\\u2019re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There\\u2019s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we\\u2019re instructed to sit back into child\\u2019s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It\\u2019s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I\\u2019m stretching and there\\u2019s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don\\u2019t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I\\u2019m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I\\u2019m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I\\u2019m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I\\u2019m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone\\u2019s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I\\u2019m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.\"],[\"\\u201cKeep it Small\\u201d There\\u2019s some kind of outdoor grouping. There\\u2019s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I\\u2019m not there to particularly attend. It\\u2019s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I\\u2019m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son\\u2019s friend\\u2019s moms, Melissa. She\\u2019s Noah\\u2019s mom. She\\u2019s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: \\u201cHere are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don\\u2019t react.\\u201d The lecturer doesn\\u2019t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, \\u201cAnd this is how you can keep it out of your face.\\u201d I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn\\u2019t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I\\u2019m asking her: \\u201cAre you buying into this? What do you think?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for some time now.\\u201d She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn\\u2019t had any \\u201caction\\u201d in quite a few months. I say, \\u201cWell, maybe that\\u2019s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you\\u2019re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That\\u2019s a good thing!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She\\u2019s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn\\u2019t anything to be outrageously happy about. I\\u2019m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that\\u2019s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn\\u2019t be able to pull so many people into this. It\\u2019s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it\\u2019s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I\\u2019m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I\\u2019m at home. I\\u2019m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it\\u2019s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I\\u2019m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I\\u2019m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I\\u2019m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I\\u2019ve got orange and blue in there now. I\\u2019m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bubble Gum Pipe\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room and people I used to work with at a restaurant while at university are gathered in this room. They\\u2019re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They\\u2019re there, too. At first I don\\u2019t notice them because they\\u2019re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we\\u2019re in this other place. They have a baby. I\\u2019m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we\\u2019re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I\\u2019m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I\\u2019m watching the skaters. I\\u2019m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She\\u2019s got a platter in her hands. It\\u2019s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She\\u2019s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It\\u2019s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she\\u2019s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I\\u2019m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don\\u2019t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don\\u2019t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: \\u201cFreya, get over here. I\\u2019ve got one for you.\\u201d So I start to walk closer to her. But I\\u2019m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it\\u2019s warm and there\\u2019s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI heat it up with taffy first.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don\\u2019t want it in my mouth. She says, \\u201cCome on. You\\u2019re coming with us.\\u201d I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, \\u201cMy dad, I need to let him know where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. He\\u2019ll be okay for a bit.\\u201d I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go see my mom and dad.\\u201d We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We\\u2019re almost at her parents\\u2019 place. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He\\u2019s going to be worried about me.\\u201d I look down and say, \\u201cOh we don\\u2019t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can\\u2019t even call him.\\u201d She says to me, \\u201cYour dad was crying when I saw him. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d Then I get more distraught. She says, \\u201cHe knows where my parents live. He\\u2019ll know where to come get you.\\u201d I think that he won\\u2019t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, \\u201cHow did we get all the way over here?!\\u201d Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman\\u2019s house. I think, \\u201cHow is this truck even making it down the side because it\\u2019s so steep?\\u201d It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I\\u2019m not going to get to my dad in time. He\\u2019s going to be gone by the time I get there because this is taking so very long. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Accident\\u201d I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There\\u2019s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There\\u2019s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it\\u2019s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There\\u2019s an image of Ken. He\\u2019s raking or something - he\\u2019s doing something to the land. I feel like I\\u2019ve just finished doing what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There\\u2019s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There\\u2019s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. I\\u2019m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I\\u2019m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it\\u2019s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she\\u2019s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I\\u2019m starting to become aware of the room I\\u2019m in. I can\\u2019t move my body. I feel like I don\\u2019t remember what happened. I see Ken. He\\u2019s in the room. He says, \\u201cYou were in an accident.\\u201d He leaves. I\\u2019m in this room in the hospital. I don\\u2019t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can\\u2019t touch my face. Ken\\u2019s wife says to me: \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay.\\u201d I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can\\u2019t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo. Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.\\u201d The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re so far away I can\\u2019t identify them. I\\u2019m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, why shouldn\\u2019t I be doing this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, this is where you had that accident.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t say anything else. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m supposed to remember something or if I\\u2019m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can\\u2019t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I\\u2019m bobbing around and thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s funny. I don\\u2019t think I know how to swim.\\u201d Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the house. I\\u2019m in a bed. Ken\\u2019s wife is standing over me and says, \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThe water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?\\u201d I feel around my face with my fingers and there\\u2019s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, just rest.\\u201d She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, \\u201cI thought we weren\\u2019t supposed to tell her.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.\\u201d I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There\\u2019s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s about time somebody told me what really happened before.\\u201d This time Ken answers. He says, \\u201cOkay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.\\u201d Then, before I wake up, I\\u2019m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I\\u2019m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Long Night\\u201d I\\u2019m riding my bike. I put a few things in my backpack. I notice that I\\u2019m wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt. It\\u2019s dark. I ride my bike all the way from one end of town to the other. The town ends. I keep riding. I come to the home of my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents. I stop there for a little bit. The mom\\u2019s sister is there, too. I feel detached from them in some way. I think they\\u2019re talking about something that\\u2019s racist. Because I\\u2019m kind of detached, they don\\u2019t really care if I\\u2019m there or not. I get back on my bicycle and leave. I keep riding. It\\u2019s still dark. I\\u2019m getting tired. Then I stop at a building. I go in. Inside are the studio owners of a place I used to teach at, but don\\u2019t anymore because of their unethical way of scheduling their staff. The building isn\\u2019t a studio though, it\\u2019s just this long building. They both appear to be busy with other tasks. The building is a long rectangle. I think I\\u2019m just there to rest. There isn\\u2019t anything in it. I\\u2019m not talking to the owners, I'm just standing there. Suddenly there\\u2019s a counter, like you\\u2019d see at a bank. They\\u2019re each on one side of the counter. A woman comes up to the counter. Now I\\u2019m on the same side as one of them. She is busy and writing in some kind of big ledger. The woman asks a question. Now I see that I have some tickets in my hand. I tell her that it\\u2019s a raffle for my son\\u2019s hockey team. She says, \\u201cOh, in that case, I\\u2019ll buy tickets.\\u201d I\\u2019m writing her name on them and then ripping them out of the booklet. I hand her the tickets and say, \\u201cHe\\u2019s also in theatre. I know it\\u2019s an odd combination - hockey and theatre.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, my son does the same thing. It\\u2019s nice to have boys who are interested in both.\\u201d We start talking together and leave. I realize I need to use the washroom. I go into the washroom and the other woman does, too. She\\u2019s in the stall next to me. I\\u2019m getting toilet paper off the roll on the wall, but it\\u2019s not really toilet paper. It\\u2019s actually thick towels. I hear her say, \\u201cDo you have any extra?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, one moment.\\u201d I\\u2019m getting some off the roll for her. It takes a little while because they are thick towels. As I turn to hand her a bunch, her face is through the wall as though the wall is made of soup, or the way it is in movies like a quantum wall. Her face, which I don\\u2019t seem to have noticed before, is very white and her hair is really thin and damp and lank. I hand her the towels and both of her hands are through the wall that partitions the stalls and she takes it. She disappears and finishes whatever she\\u2019s doing. I hear her leave. I\\u2019m standing at the sink washing my face. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to be cold because it\\u2019s getting colder as the night progresses. I get back on my bike and I\\u2019m really cold and my legs are tired. I don\\u2019t know where else there is to go. I wonder if a bus comes out this far and if I can put my bicycle on the bus. But then I look down and see that I have no purse and no wallet. I realize I can\\u2019t get on a bus. I turn my bike to go back in the opposite direction I\\u2019ve come from. I\\u2019ve come a really long way. I notice as I ride by, a platform that comes to a point like a triangle. It has asphalt on the top and a curb on either side. A girl is standing on it, as if it\\u2019s a bus stop out in the middle of nowhere. I ask her if she\\u2019s waiting for a bus. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been standing here a really, really long time and no bus has come.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think busses come out this far.\\u201d She says, \\u201cAre you going back towards town?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell let\\u2019s walk together.\\u201d I get off my bike. My legs are tired of peddling anyway. I walk beside her. We walk in silence for a really long, long time. Then I ask her if she doesn\\u2019t mind telling me which end of town she lives. She says she lives in the west end. We\\u2019re still quite a bit towards the east. I say, \\u201cOh so do I.\\u201d We have to walk all the way through town to get there. I wonder, \\u201cMaybe we can share a taxi?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have my money with me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cRight, neither do I.\\u201d We\\u2019re walking and walking. Then we get to the outskirts of town finally and I notice the sun is starting to come up. She says, \\u201cOh, I have a room here at this end. Why don\\u2019t we stop here and rest a bit.\\u201d We go in. it\\u2019s just a room in a really old house that\\u2019s seen better years. The front door opens. Inside is a really long high ceiling. There\\u2019s a couch to sit on and I immediately go to the couch and sit. There\\u2019s some kind of little table, but it\\u2019s not really a table. It\\u2019s like two wooden boxes stacked on top of each other, about one foot by one foot square, and tall. She has some things on it - little tiny containers. She says to me: \\u201cThis wallpaper has been bugging me for a really long time. I think I want to take it down.\\u201d I notice that the wall is a homemade checkerboard. She tells me the landlord did it himself. There\\u2019s a pale green paint on the wall. He\\u2019s made the checkerboard out of wallpaper and paint squares alternating. The part made of wallpaper is really interesting with white and colors - light blue and orange watercolor wash. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how he did this, or I would paint over it.\\u201d I get up from the couch to take a good look. I say, \\u201cHmm, it looks like there\\u2019s some kind of pigment in the paint that as he applied it with the roller, it was heat activated and the color pigments expanded and bled into each other.\\u201d She says, \\u201cHmm maybe you\\u2019re right.\\u201d But as I look deeper into it, I see that it\\u2019s made of a whole bunch of different scraps of wallpaper that he\\u2019s somehow laid on top of each other. There are layers and layers and layers. It looks like multicolor paint, but it\\u2019s these layers and layers of colored wallpaper scraps. Then I see that it\\u2019s only thumbtacked to the wall. I say, \\u201cLook. It\\u2019s starting to come off at the corners, so you can just take the whole thing off.\\u201d So she starts to take the thumbtacks out and puts them in the little containers on the wooden crate table. Underneath that are more colors of wallpaper and layers. She\\u2019s happy with it, but it\\u2019s the same thing underneath, so that\\u2019s interesting. As she\\u2019s doing this, a woman comes in with her young son. The young boy didn\\u2019t really look like his mom. The mom\\u2019s face was round like the moon. His head was longer and narrow. I remember thinking that he was such an interesting combination of features. He was halfway in between the washed out color of Heather and the vibrant darker color of his mom. I realize this is a daycare. The woman addresses the person I was walking with as Heather. For the first time I notice that Heather is kind of washed out. She has features, but they don\\u2019t stand out from her skin very much. It\\u2019s hard to see what she looks like. I notice she has paler skin and freckles and this pale mousy brown hair. The woman asks Heather: \\u201cDo you believe in conspiracies?\\u201d I notice that one of the checkerboards has the word, \\u201cconspiracy\\u201d written on it. Heather replies, \\u201cYes.\\u201d The woman who enters says, \\u201cGood. I\\u2019ll be back soon for my son.\\u201d Then she gets in her car. The wall of the building has disappeared. She tells me to hop in the back. The car looks like a Model-T Ford. There\\u2019s a newer model car that imitates its look with the wide panels. The car is made of wood. The back part has a little rumble seat and she indicates I should sit there. I notice the woman\\u2019s skin is a deep brown. She\\u2019s wearing a fantastical hat. Her dress is a pale mauve and it\\u2019s ethereal and floats like a Great Gatsby dress. She\\u2019s wearing round John Lennon glasses. I get in the rumble seat. She starts the car and I say, \\u201cAre you sure this car will make it?\\u201d She says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing wrong with this car at all.\\u201d She drives it through the house, which has gelatinous quantum type walls and doors. We go out to the back and there\\u2019s hay on the ground. There\\u2019s a barn, but we\\u2019re in an old urban city area, turn of the century with row houses that went up really fast to house people who worked in factories. But there\\u2019s a barn! It\\u2019s really unconducive to the rest. She says, \\u201cThis is one of the only barns left in this town.\\u201d She parks the car and we get out. The woman disappears and now I go back into the house from the back. Heather and the young boy are in the only other room in the building - it\\u2019s a kitchen. I start putting food together. I look in the cupboards. There\\u2019s something that\\u2019s corn-based, like a ground up corn. The other ingredients are really odd and I don\\u2019t think it will go together. I also notice that it\\u2019s safe for me to eat because it\\u2019s all corn-based. I start mixing something up. As I\\u2019m adding water, it turns into other ingredients. We eat. I tell them - Heather and the young boy - that it\\u2019s time for me to go now because I really need to get back to my own house. I leave. It\\u2019s warmer now and I feel a little rested. I finish the journey to my own home.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Television Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house of my daughter\\u2019s grandparents, both of whom have crossed over. The house doesn\\u2019t look exactly like the house they used to live in, but I know it\\u2019s their house. I\\u2019m in it and I can feel the air has a different quality - it\\u2019s light and has particles in it, it\\u2019s as though I am standing in front of a window and can see light streaming in with particles floating in it. It\\u2019s so light and bright. The house is empty but it feels like there\\u2019s a presence in the light. Gradually Roberta and Tom appear. They look just like they did when I met them. Tom is busy with a project. He\\u2019s making something outside - he\\u2019s building something. Roberta is inside. She\\u2019s putting something together with her hands. One of her daughters appears and she\\u2019s laughing and joking. She\\u2019s, in a loving way, mocking what her mom is doing. Then they ask me if I would be involved with this project. I ask what it is that they\\u2019re doing. They say they\\u2019re creating hairstyles for people that are going to be on the television show. I realize that there\\u2019s a producer involved that\\u2019s giving some of the instructions, but I can\\u2019t see him and they\\u2019re just making reference to him. Roberta and Tom have a lot of autonomy. Someone is just doing the filming. I agree to do part of the hairstyles. They\\u2019re putting the styles together on paper first, but not as a drawing - it\\u2019s a standout relief like you\\u2019d make a sculpture - only they\\u2019re doing it with bits and pieces of things to create a finished product that is a hairstyle. There are all kinds of stuff woven into the hairstyles as if it\\u2019s been upcycled out of bits of ribbon, yarn and human hair. It\\u2019s colorful and unique in a way that I\\u2019ve never thought of before. It\\u2019s actually coming out more like a headdress which makes sense because they are Native North American. Then Tom comes in from outside and he\\u2019s washing his hands because he\\u2019s been making some kind of vehicle, some kind of car. I don\\u2019t see what he\\u2019s doing, though. He says he\\u2019s about finished and his part is ready to go. We say that we\\u2019re ready to do the headdress. We share a meal and then the producer comes and films Tom\\u2019s part outside first. Someone else is following the prototype headdresses we created and implementing it. We\\u2019re returning the camaraderie, laughing and joking. At one point, Roberta is saying something to me and her daughter is standing right behind me and making remarks like, \\u201cOh sure sure,\\u201d really close to my ear. Roberta says, \\u201cWhat are you saying?\\u201d Her daughter won\\u2019t repeat it. I think that I don\\u2019t like being a vessel for this. Then the producer comes in and asks us if we would like to preview the movie. Everybody says yes. We go to the living room and the lights are dimmed somehow - this is weird because there are no lights in the house, only the heavily particled lightness. But it does dim so we can see a movie projected onto the wall. The opening credits go up showing the background parts that everyone did - creative direction, innovation, etc.. Then, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a screen that comes up with Tom\\u2019s car. I realize the movie is about the making of it. I\\u2019m astonished at the innovation that has been put into this vehicle. It\\u2019s similar to the headdresses we developed. His vehicle is made out of so many different things. It doesn\\u2019t look junky, though, it looks really sophisticated, polished and well integrated. In fact, you wouldn\\u2019t even know it\\u2019s a vehicle when you first look at it. There are so many different things in it. It definitely looks metal, but when you look, you can see pieces that form the finished metal but aren\\u2019t metal. They\\u2019ve got this upcycled feel to it, but in a highly sophisticated and finished product.\"],[\"\\u201cWalking the Night\\u201d In this dream, it\\u2019s dark and it\\u2019s nighttime. I am with two people; one is my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt and the other is my son\\u2019s grade 8 teacher. It\\u2019s a really odd combination of people. It\\u2019s like we just left somewhere, I don\\u2019t know where. We\\u2019re in an urban setting and we\\u2019re just walking. We\\u2019re walking in solitude. It\\u2019s a long walk. I can feel the fatigue in my legs. After a while, we get to someone\\u2019s house - it\\u2019s one of theirs, but I don\\u2019t know which one. We go in. it feels like it\\u2019s time to rest. My body says it\\u2019s time to rest, but no one is sleeping yet. Everyone is still awake. After some time of sitting on the couch, continuing not to say anything, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt wanders off and I assume she\\u2019s gone to sleep. I take this as permission to do the same. I wander around to find another room. I lie down on the bed on top of the covers. I\\u2019m almost asleep. The grade 8 teacher comes in and lies down on the covers as well. I feel she\\u2019s asleep, too. I wake up. It\\u2019s still dark and it\\u2019s still nighttime. Omar is beside me on the bed. I turn towards him and toss my arm and leg over him, so I\\u2019m hugging him as I sleep. I wake up. We\\u2019re still all there sleeping. I\\u2019m having a restless sleep. Then I just fall back to sleep. The next time I wake up, it\\u2019s morning and neither Omar nor the grade 8 teacher are awake yet. I just lie there for a little until I feel her stir. She doesn\\u2019t make any comment about Omar being there and I suddenly wonder if I\\u2019m the only one that can see him. She gets up and just fades away. I get up and I go into the kitchen. Debra is there, as are some other people. I start to wash the dishes - there\\u2019s a massive pile of them; they\\u2019re all over the kitchen counter. I reach for the plug. It\\u2019s really quite disgusting, the amount of soggy food bits as no one has emptied the plug or drain out for some time. So I have to dig around to find the plug and I\\u2019m scooping out bits of soggy food and putting it in the garbage. I wash a few dishes then someone has set up to dry them - I think it\\u2019s Debra. The pile is too big and I have to wait to wash some more, so I leave the kitchen and go down the hallway, which is now a different hallway; the house has shifted. I notice that there are animals in it. There\\u2019s a rabbit - it\\u2019s white and black - and it\\u2019s hopping around from room to room. It sees me and just stops hopping and looks at me. I wonder, \\u201cHmm, it doesn\\u2019t seem to be afraid of me.\\u201d It\\u2019s a big rabbit. I turn around and see Disney characters or fantasy characters on top of a white bookshelf like the bookshelf I had when I was a little girl. A man that looks like a friend of mine reaches up. I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on top of the bookshelf, but he reaches up and pulls one down. I realize it\\u2019s her favorite character. He takes it into another room and I know he\\u2019s taking it to her. I stand on the bed because I want to see what the other characters are. There is a Bugs Bunny and another one that\\u2019s red and another one that\\u2019s purple. I\\u2019m starting to see that what I first thought were Disney characters are not; they\\u2019re a combination of animals and mythological creatures. Each one is very unique. I think that it's curious. I wonder who put them up there where they can\\u2019t be seen. Now I step back down from the bed and walk down the hallway to the kitchen. I finish the dishes and set them on the counter. Now everything is clean.\"],[\"\\u201cMayoral Politic\\u201d This dream is more of a thematic than a narrative. It looked like one of those old fashioned great big signs when you enter a town where it has the mayor\\u2019s face on it, then a story about the town. It was like a threshold or portal or lived experience rather than just a great big giant sign. It looked old, too, it had an oval shape to the story, the painted picture of the mayor was in the upper left hand side. I\\u2019m looking at a description, but it\\u2019s also an entry into a town. So it\\u2019s not two-dimensional. On the description is a comparison of a mayor and the lifestyle of someone involved in a subculture and has a motorcycle. The mayor is female. She looks like she\\u2019s had a life of outdoors - there\\u2019s a sun-kissed color to her skin. She has short blonde wavy and dense hair. She looks like she would be a muscular person even though the picture only has her face. The description is like a political analysis of someone who is mayor of a town and removed from that duty that caters to the idea of mayor but stays in the office and doesn\\u2019t really interact - maybe like how clueless the aristocracy was to the plight of the common people. So it\\u2019s a comparison between mayoral duties that are detached and removed from what people need as opposed to someone who is more rebellious of that polite culture, rides a motorcycle, but is simultaneously responsive to the needs of the town and then is praised. But the praise is lie: despite the fact that there is a motorcycle, there is a number of positive qualities that the mayor has. It\\u2019s not two-dimensional in that I\\u2019m reading this. I\\u2019m feeling it as a lived experience in my body when these two descriptions are compared and contrasted. It\\u2019s like an entryway into that experience. I consider them from how my body feels about them, then decide that I would rather live in a place with a mayor that rides a motorcycle and is somewhat rebellious but responsive, than the mayor that caters to polite society but is cluelessly privileged.\"],[\"\\u201cGrapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water\\u201d This dream starts in my house. It\\u2019s not the house I currently live in; it\\u2019s not a house I\\u2019m familiar with at all. I\\u2019m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we\\u2019ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It\\u2019s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It\\u2019s beautiful. It\\u2019s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don\\u2019t say anything. We\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cYep, this is going to be good.\\u201d We go in. There\\u2019s an older woman who is taking people\\u2019s names. She\\u2019s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it\\u2019s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person\\u2019s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it\\u2019s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people\\u2019s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We\\u2019re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she\\u2019s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it\\u2019s like a black walnut dark. It\\u2019s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people\\u2019s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It\\u2019s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re standing on. I realize what they\\u2019re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life - they\\u2019re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it\\u2019s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I\\u2019m on a rollercoaster, but it\\u2019s moving through the church. I can see the track that it\\u2019s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there\\u2019s no track after that and we\\u2019re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don\\u2019t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It\\u2019s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That\\u2019s where everybody is going. So we\\u2019re new and we follow the crowd. It\\u2019s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I\\u2019ll slide backwards, but I don\\u2019t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there\\u2019s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there\\u2019s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It\\u2019s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I\\u2019m sitting in, I realize it\\u2019s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it\\u2019s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We\\u2019re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it\\u2019s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I\\u2019m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I\\u2019ve noticed that we\\u2019re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We\\u2019ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it\\u2019s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we\\u2019re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn\\u2019t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: \\u201cHave we contributed to this in some way?\\u201d So there\\u2019s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we\\u2019re just supposed to help make it or if we\\u2019ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there\\u2019s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I\\u2019m asking her if she knows where we\\u2019re supposed to be at what time. She says, \\u201cOh yes, I still have that information, it\\u2019s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven\\u2019t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you\\u2019d be back.\\u201d That\\u2019s just a memory. Then the people we\\u2019re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We\\u2019ve walked down this path from the church - it\\u2019s a dirt path that\\u2019s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren\\u2019t in an urban area. It\\u2019s like non-urbanized, but we\\u2019re not in the woods because there\\u2019s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can\\u2019t see what they are. It\\u2019s not just a dock, it\\u2019s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we\\u2019ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I\\u2019ve recently noted that he\\u2019s involved in this conspiracy group and they\\u2019re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He\\u2019s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it\\u2019s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we\\u2019re with take the cloth off the boat. I\\u2019m happy to see it\\u2019s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: \\u201cYou know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI do, but it\\u2019s not mine. Whose boat is it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn\\u2019t here and this other person who I don\\u2019t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it\\u2019s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I\\u2019m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I\\u2019m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it\\u2019s okay. He says, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It\\u2019s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I\\u2019ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I\\u2019m checking out the rigging.There\\u2019s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They\\u2019re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it\\u2019s a weird place to have this because normally they\\u2019re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can\\u2019t see what the operate. I\\u2019m trying to figure this out. The ship\\u2019s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I\\u2019m looking at it I\\u2019m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I\\u2019m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they\\u2019re not even ships at all, but they\\u2019re bobbing up and down so they\\u2019re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I\\u2019m off the boat of the woman who I didn\\u2019t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that\\u2019s okay because I didn\\u2019t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don\\u2019t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he\\u2019s not there. So I text him and ask him if he\\u2019s going to be sailing today. He says, \\u201cYes. Just wait there and I\\u2019ll be down at my boat in a moment.\\u201d My daughter and I wait. We\\u2019re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We\\u2019re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, \\u201cOkay, are you guys ready to go?\\u201d We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it\\u2019s right up against the dock and as we look in, it\\u2019s so deep that it\\u2019s black - you can\\u2019t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it\\u2019s so long I can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s enormous. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"At one point I was in a restaurant. My daughter was with me and she was a little girl again. There was nowhere to sit, so we cleared the table and brought the dishes into the kitchen. While we were in there, someone else took the table and moved the stuff I left there and put it on the floor. I was upset. There\\u2019s another snippet where I\\u2019m in a sailboat in the middle of a lake. We deliberately sail out into the middle of the lake. We put the sails away and then use the main halyard to pull people up. You can swing out onto the lake and let go and plunge in. When my daughter was on it, she wouldn\\u2019t let go so she kept swinging around and around and around.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Radio Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really interesting old house here. It\\u2019s semi-dark, too - it\\u2019s like the air has that kind of presence to it where the molecules have some kind of sentience. You can feel the energy in the air. It feels compassionate. So it\\u2019s also not very light. The windows, although they\\u2019re big, don\\u2019t seem to transmit an awful lot of light, so that casts a little bit of a shadowy effect over everything in the house. I\\u2019m aware that there is a floor above me, but I don't go into it in my dream. The ceilings are really high. The windows are deep and wide. It feels like mid-eighteenth century architecture of someone who would have had enough money to build a fair-sized house. I guess you would call the parlor, because it\\u2019s off the kitchen, has a big archway that goes into the sitting room. I can see the sitting room and kitchen from the parlor, but I stay in the parlor which has a big couch with deep cushions in it and a turkish rug that\\u2019s woven and quite colorful in muted tones. There\\u2019s electronic equipment against one of the walls. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m supposed to be recording some kind of radio show. In order to add my segment, I have to walk over to the electronic equipment - it\\u2019s got dials on it - and I\\u2019m moving the dials around watching the needle on the screen move up and down as I turn the dial. I\\u2019m trying to get it centered in the screen so I have a signal. Once I get the needle centered, I can hear the radio show that\\u2019s in progress. When I hear a certain tone, I\\u2019m supposed to start talking. I have brought with me what looks like an iPod, but it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s some kind of device that adds music that will be a bridge. I have to fade in the music, let it play for a few seconds, then fade the music out, then I\\u2019m to say what I\\u2019m supposed to say. My segment is 30 minutes. So I do this. I am waiting for the tone and I hear the tone. Somebody else\\u2019s music enters the feed. I can hear it, but when I try to center the dials to add my section, that music won\\u2019t go away. I think, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just sit here and wait the half hour that my segment is supposed to be and if the music keeps playing, then I\\u2019ll just leave after the half hour is over. I\\u2019m waiting. Twenty-three minutes pass and I know there\\u2019s only seven minutes left. I think it\\u2019s almost going to be time for me to go when someone else comes in the room. She says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re not adding your part.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s this strange music that isn\\u2019t responding to any of the dials.\\u201d So she goes over and starts moving the dials around. She\\u2019s trying to fix it. Her girlfriend comes into the room and sits down on the floor and waits. She spends the next seven minutes fiddling with it. Then the time is up. I just tell them I\\u2019m going to go. They ask, \\u201cCan you come back and try again tomorrow at the same time?\\u201d I consider this for a minute wondering if i want to keep just coming back here and waiting for nothing to happen. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try and come back one more time tomorrow.\\u201d Then, I\\u2019ve got this pack that goes across one shoulder, across my body and sits on my hip. I reach into it and grab two round discs about the size of a Canadian toonie. But they\\u2019re not toonies. They\\u2019re bumpy, thin and made of a condensed grain of some sort. I\\u2019m thinking that if you put them in water, they\\u2019ll swell up. I hand one of them to her. I close up the flat. As I turn around I notice one of my students is there. He walks with me as I go out the door. I walk down the porch and all of a sudden, it\\u2019s a lot lighter outside, but the sun isn\\u2019t shining; it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s less darkness. Het disappears - I guess he walks somewhere else. There\\u2019s a group of people, vendors, that have lined up these tall skinny tables that are like tubs along the sidewalk. I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s in them - they\\u2019re a little taller than my head, so I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s inside. They\\u2019re probably 1 foot by 2 foot in diameter and maybe another 1 foot deep. At the end of one, there\\u2019s a stepladder and I can climb up to see what\\u2019s in there. As I climb up, I see a whole bunch more of these little discs. I realize that they\\u2019re not made of grain, but of almonds. A woman who appears to be in charge approaches. She says \\u201cAa-mond\\u201d instead of almond. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cIs that the proper way to say this?\\u201d She repeats it twice like a callout: \\u201cAa-mond Aa-mond, Aa-mond Aamond.\\u201d So she\\u2019s selling them. She asks me if I\\u2019m interested in one of the Aa-monds Aa-monds. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you.\\u201d She says, \\u201cCome and sit down with me. I want to talk with you.\\u201d There\\u2019s something that looks like a two-person porch swing where the people are facing each other and your feet sit on the bottom and it moves on its own rocker. She sits in it and indicates that she wants me to sit across from her. So I do. She leans in. She has a smirk on her face as though she thinks it\\u2019s funny and says, \\u201cWhat do you think of Aa-mond Aa-mond?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe catchy way you\\u2019re pronouncing it? Or the product itself?\\u201d She says, No, what do you think of the way I\\u2019m calling it out?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s catchy. Caught my eye. I don\\u2019t understand what it is, but it was catchy enough that I turned my head to listen to you.\\u201d She kind of laughs. Right at that point, the dream ends, but in front of my face, I see this dangling pendant. It\\u2019s the size of my face and is all silver. It looks like it\\u2019s made out of molded Mercury. It\\u2019s a cat - a wild cat. It\\u2019s strangely futuristic amid this old-style market. It\\u2019s sleek, like a jaguar. It\\u2019s dangling on something. So it just appears and hangs down in front of my face. It\\u2019s probably 8-10 inches long and maybe about 4 inches wide. The mouth is slightly open and the lips are sort of curled back and it has fangs. It really looks like a jaguar head, except its ears are flattened, so there\\u2019s a sleakness about it that really doesn\\u2019t belong in the historical feel of the house, street market or the Aa-mond Aamond that people are selling.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Mural\\u201d It\\u2019s strange that I\\u2019m in the bedroom I had when I was a kid, but the furniture is gone. There are several people here with me, including my daughter and somebody I used to work with - I can\\u2019t remember which restaurant and I\\u2019m not even sure of his name. I think there is the man who did my daughter\\u2019s tattoo. I feel like my stepmother is in there, as well. The point of everybody being there is to draw a mural. It\\u2019s not clear what the subject of the mural is supposed to look like. One person starts off drawing in black with paint and a paintbrush what looks to be a fish. But then somebody comments, \\u201cNo that\\u2019s not right. That\\u2019s not what it looks like,\\u201d and then adjusts it - makes the torso/belly area a little thinner and makes it even thinner as it goes back towards the tail. Then someone else says, \\u201cMmm, that\\u2019s closer, but it still doesn\\u2019t look right.\\u201d Then someone else takes the paintbrush and begins to draw legs on it. Now it\\u2019s starting to look more like an insect with somewhat of a fish face. There\\u2019s a consensus that yes, that\\u2019s much closer to what it resembled. Then my daughter gets in there and removes part of it and adds what I think is much more accurate in terms of the legs and ribcage. Then I fall asleep for a little while, maybe just five minutes. I don\\u2019t think anyone noticed I was sleeping. When I woke up, it\\u2019s stunning. I\\u2019m thinking that it\\u2019s exactly what it looks like and it\\u2019s even got more details. I see the tattoo artist with the paintbrush in his hand and think yes, he would have been the one to put the detail on it. Then the other guy leaves the room and I do, too. We go down the hall and into the kitchen. He stays in the kitchen and I go out front of the kitchen. Now it looks like the kitchen has a passthrough window and the seating area is a big wide square auditorium. There are long rectangular tables set up that hold food, like a wedding buffet. The tables are covered with a white cloth. There are also round tables covered with white cloths and they have multiple chairs at them. There\\u2019s a stage like a school auditorium, but there\\u2019s no one on it and people aren\\u2019t facing the stage, either. The food is all set out on this one L-shaped table. I look at it and think that the food looks disgusting. It looks sloppy. Every single one has dried ramen noodles on the top as some kind of garnish. The items in the bowls are covered with breading. Each one looks slightly the same, only a little different. There are also cheese balls rolled in cracker crumbs and deep fried. I just think, \\u201cUgh, there\\u2019s nothing fresh anywhere.\\u201d My son is sitting at the table and I know he needs to eat. So I take two plates - one for him and one for me - and I head for the platter of plain roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. I think we can eat that. Just as I get there, a man who looks like the man who bought my sailboat. In my dream he has three little kids. He takes the big serving fork and squishes all the chicken up with the mashed potatoes and gravy and it\\u2019s making some kind of thick soup. I\\u2019m aghast because there were dried wheat noodles on the top and now they\\u2019re all mixed in. I say to him, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that on a buffet! Now nobody else can eat that.\\u201d He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWell, my kids like it that way.\\u201d I tell him that now there\\u2019s nothing for us to eat. I\\u2019m angry. I can feel the anger in my body - I can feel my heart racing and my body tightening up. So I try to sift through it with my spoon to determine if there are any pieces of potato or chicken that the gravy and wheat didn\\u2019t stick to. But after putting two tiny spoonfuls on my plate, I know it\\u2019s hopeless and I just set the plates down. My son goes back to the table and he\\u2019s just sitting there. I approach the kitchen and am thinking, \\u201cI wonder if that Rob guy has anything back there that he could give us that is not quite ready to be served on the table and hasn\\u2019t been coated with all that yucky stuff yet.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and notice that at the base of the passthrough window has holes with stagnant water in them. The water is black with algae. I can smell the mildew earth smell rising up from it. I wonder if the water was removed from it, if it would dry up and be more healthy. There\\u2019s a plastic pump with a long hose and a hand pump at the other end. It\\u2019s like the pump you\\u2019d use to pump out the bilge in a sailboat. So I stick the end in the water and I start pumping. The water does go out of the hole, but as soon as it goes out, it fills up again. I repeat this process about three times. It keeps filling up, but it only fills up a little bit, just enough to cover the black earth that is the component part of the hole. So I set the pump down and I stop. I\\u2019m hesitant to ask for food from the kitchen. I go back to the table and tell my son, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go.\\u201d We walk down a different hallway than we entered the room from. There are multiple bedrooms like there would be in a hotel for people to sleep in.\"],[\"\\u201cThe New Baby\\u201d I\\u2019m walking through a very busy urban area with a friend. It\\u2019s a downtown, heavily trafficked, very densely populated city. I know this because of the number of people around, the lack of space on the sidewalk, the streetcars and regular cars on the street that are passing by on the roadway, and the height of the buildings surrounding the street. I\\u2019m involved in a conversation with my friend. We\\u2019ve been walking for some blocks. We approach someone else riding a different looking kind of bicycle. It has two wheels at the back and one wheel at the front, so it\\u2019s a tricycle but it\\u2019s made for adults and you sit really low on the seat. My friend sees the person riding the bicycle and greets them. The cyclist slows down. My friend approaches the bicyclist and I realize they know each other. They have a conversation that I can\\u2019t hear. My friend\\u2019s back is to me and I can\\u2019t see who the cyclist is. It carries the energy of privacy anyway, so I don\\u2019t even try to approach. My friend walks back towards me and the cyclist continues for a few minutes ahead of us, and then she slows down again. Again, my friend approaches the cyclist and they have a private conversation. My friend comes back to me and says, \\u201cMy friend doesn\\u2019t talk to that many people. So don\\u2019t take it personally. It\\u2019s just how she is.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine.\\u201d We are walking while she says this. Then the cyclist slows down enough that she\\u2019s kind of keeping pace with us. She\\u2019s cycling beside my friend who is in the middle between us. My friend hangs back a little bit. It\\u2019s just the cyclist and I. Then I see her face. I realize the cyclist is female. She\\u2019s very withdrawn - i can sense this - so I don\\u2019t try to talk with her. My friend rejoins us - the one who was walking on foot - and says, \\u201cMy friend would like to talk to you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh okay.\\u201d I don\\u2019t recall that she ever said anything to me. I just feel that I\\u2019ve been invited into her inner circle. We all arrive at a place where the bicycle is parked. It looks like a storefront, but I can't see what\\u2019s inside because the windows are blackened. We all walk in. There is a very large bed that takes up most of the room once we get in there. There is a little girl playing on it. Beside that, in the two foot space between the bed and wall, there is another child playing. They seem to be very close in age. I\\u2019m gauging them to be no more than one year apart and I\\u2019m thinking about this. Then I realize that my friend\\u2019s friend, the cyclist, is pregnant. The little girl that was on the bed approaches me and she\\u2019s bouncing up and down on the bed and she\\u2019s so full of joy, innocence and exuberance. She invites me to jump on the bed with her. I don\\u2019t actually do that, but I take her by the hands and my upper body is jumping up and down - I\\u2019m not on the bed, my feet are on the ground. The child that was playing on the floor tries to join us but she can't get up on the bed, so I pick her up. I\\u2019ve been interacting with the children for a few minutes when the cyclist makes some kind of comment, but I never hear her voice. I feel like she\\u2019s commented about the fact that I\\u2019m getting along with the children. Then, everyone starts playing a game - it\\u2019s a find the things that are these colors kind of game. There\\u2019s a find something that\\u2019s green game and the kids scamper off. They don\\u2019t go very far because the room is very small and crowded with all kinds of stuff and a lot of different hair ornaments. I realize that the one child that was playing on the floor has a side ponytail made of short hair that sticks out of the side of her head like a shaving brush and the other one on the bed has a complex series of colored barrettes in her hair that keeps it off her face. So there\\u2019s a lot of different hair accessories. Then it\\u2019s a find something that\\u2019s purple game. I wait til the kids find their purple things, then I take a thick scrunchie with a purple ponytail attached to it and I select that and something else with tiny purple flowers on it. Then the cyclist woman says something but not out loud. I just realize that as I\\u2019m holding this scrunchie with a purple ponytail attached to it that it\\u2019s hers and she has some other different dyed hair colors in her own hair - she\\u2019s dyed it various colors and it\\u2019s quite creative. At this point I realize that this cyclist who is pregnant and my friend are partners. They have kept this on the downlow and not told anyone. This is their family. They\\u2019re looking for someone who will help out after the next baby is born. My friend asks if I would like to do this. I say, \\u201cYes, I would love to.\\u201d This is their way of slowly introducing me into their family without actually telling me that they were looking for someone. At this point, the doorbell rings or someone is knocking on the door. Now there is a hallway in the house and I go down the hallway to answer the door. There are some people outside with furniture. They have to bring it into the house, but it\\u2019s too big and doesn\\u2019t fit. I walk outside and look at it and see if there is any way of taking it apart. There is, but it\\u2019s really complicated. You have to take pieces of the base off. Now they look like tiles and I\\u2019m knocking them out with a hammer. There\\u2019s a man who is helping. I say to him, \\u201cWell this is good. But how do we get the tiles back in once we move it in the house?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh here look.\\u201d I see that there\\u2019s a tiny plastic line that encircles the whole base of this structure. If you hang the tile from it, wait a couple seconds, then give it a tap with a hammer, it replaces it. I try a few on my own with him there and it works, so this is good. The people that brought the furniture are now bringing it into the house, disassembled. I\\u2019m starting to pick up the pieces of tile and carry them back into the kitchen. The little girls are still jumping up and down and skipping around. They\\u2019re just happy. I go into the kitchen to start to prepare a meal. A man comes up behind me and goes underneath my skirt and stands up so I\\u2019m on his shoulders. I feel very light. I\\u2019m still preparing the food with my hands. It\\u2019s an interesting experience of being taller and lighter. I feel childlike. I\\u2019m enjoying this.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Operation\\u201d In this dream I\\u2019m at my sister and brother-in-law\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m sitting on a stool in their kitchen with my elbows on the kitchen island. My nephew who is training to be in Medical school - in fact he\\u2019s almost finished - has got a colander out of the cupboard and put three or four potatoes in it. He leaves it on the island and then leaves the kitchen. I think to myself: \\u201cHmm, I guess I\\u2019m supposed to be making the mashed potatoes.\\u201d Instead of cooking them and mashing them with a potato masher, I poke them repeatedly with some sort of instrument that I have in my hand - it\\u2019s some kind of kitchen tool. I do this until they are little tiny pieces of potato in the colander. Two other members of my family (it\\u2019s fuzzy who they are) come in. They are criticizing the way I\\u2019ve done this and saying it won\\u2019t work. My nephew returns to the kitchen and says, \\u201cOh yes, this will work. This is how I learned to do it at school. I\\u2019ve done this before. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Because he said that, the people who were criticizing me stop criticizing. Then the potatoes are cooked and they\\u2019ve turned out just fine.\"],[\"\\u201cLists and Packing\\u201d This was a bunch of different scenarios where I\\u2019m supposed to be leaving and going away. I\\u2019m trying to pack and things keep happening. Then I'm not where I\\u2019m supposed to be. At one point I\\u2019m on a giant bus instead of a boat\\u2026 In one scenario, I\\u2019m down by a river and I\\u2019m watching some cargo be loaded into various boats. It\\u2019s actually really pretty. I\\u2019m standing in a forested area and the river isn\\u2019t very big. A woman gets on a smaller boat with two children. She stores the gear. It seems like somebody else is in front, but I don\\u2019t see him. She makes reference to him. People are saying: \\u201cAre you sure you should be going that way?\\u201d She\\u2019s a little bit rebellious and says something like: \\u201cI\\u2019m not a novice.\\u201d Then I can see that she has some kind of equipment on the stern. She folds it out. It\\u2019s actually quite fascinating because it folds up so neatly that you don\\u2019t really notice it on the stern. It\\u2019s got spring loaded parts to it. She folds it out and it snaps in place. Then there\\u2019s another fold in it and she folds that out and it snaps in place. She stands on the one in the back. Then her two kids run out and she places them on the one in the middle. It\\u2019s like ropes that go across and they\\u2019re hanging onto it with their feet braced on one part and their hands clinging to the other. She stands on the one in the back and the man she\\u2019s with - her partner or whatever - is still in the front. She says, \\u201cThis is how I navigate the rapids.\\u201d Then I stand there and watch as the boat (it\\u2019s not driven, there\\u2019s no engine) is taken by the current. It seems to go a bit faster and everybody knows that there are rapids up ahead but we don\\u2019t see her go through them. In another scenario I\\u2019m loading things from a facility that also has things you can purchase. Apparently I\\u2019ve stored the gear I have to load in this facility. I have to load the things onto a giant motorhome. In order to take my stuff into the motorhome, I have to go up six little tiny creaky stairs and open up a trapdoor - it\\u2019s a small opening and it\\u2019s taking me a long time to do this. I noticed two giant spiders just prior to the trapdoor. One spider is flexing its legs and has a body that is two inches big and round and fat. It\\u2019s also flexing its wings like a dragonfly, only sharper and more angular. I think it\\u2019s interesting and I\\u2019ve never seen a spider like that. Then just beside it is this big fat web like a caterpillars tent. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m not taking my gear through there.\\u201d So I go through a door and exit out the front of the building. So it\\u2019s taking me longer to do this. When I finish, everyone else has their gear in the motorhome and have selected their beds. I\\u2019m counting people and counting beds and thinking we should have more beds than this, there are four of us going. Someone says, \\u201cWell, I want to keep some of the beds folded up so we have somewhere to sit and we can look at maps and stuff.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a good idea.\\u201d Then I look around again and asking: \\u201cWho are all these made beds for? There isn\\u2019t one for me.\\u201d I find out that the people who are in couples have taken one bed each instead of a double bed. I mention this and say, \\u201cOne of these beds needs to be for me because I\\u2019m going on this trip and you guys have made up all the beds.\\u201d Then Caroln, my ex-best friend says, \\u201cWell you\\u2019re sleeping with me.\\u201d I don\\u2019t really want to do that. Suddenly her parents are there and they\\u2019re in another bed. I say, \\u201cWhich bed is yours?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to correlate people with beds to see who belongs with all of these. Her parents are in a double bed, so that should be fine. Then there are three other beds made up, but no other people. Then I decide to sleep in a single bed in the back. Lisa tells me I can\\u2019t sleep there because of the sidewalk, whatever that means. Then there\\u2019s this other person who was supposed to be on the trip and she has one of the beds and is using another bed for her gear. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cFloor Creatures\\u201d I\\u2019m walking down the hallway towards the office at Central Senior School. I look down at the old wooden floorboards and see thousands and thousands, millions of little tiny orange flat beings on the floor. They\\u2019re getting squished and the floor is slimy. I try to walk on my tiptoes and avoid them. I notice that if I stand still they go around me. Their movement is synchronistic like a school of fish and they are all heading the opposite direction I am. I have to get to the office, though. Even though I move really slowly, I still squish a few under my toes. I\\u2019m almost at the office when I notice that a little girl has been knocked down by the flow of traffic of other students moving. She looks like she\\u2019s only in kindergarten. I go over and pick her up. I hold her up out of the flow of traffic. Now I\\u2019m at the office and I\\u2019m standing there waiting for someone to come help. While I\\u2019m waiting with her, i notice that the floor creatures are also in the office, but because no one is stepping on them, they\\u2019re starting to get bigger. Then they get bigger and bigger and they\\u2019re almost about my hip height when they start gnashing their teeth. I\\u2019m starting to feel scared. There are a whole bunch of them and they flow out of the office and move around us as though we\\u2019re a stick in the middle of a riverbed and they just flow around us. I turn my back to them as they head this way and they don\\u2019t touch us as they go into the hallway.\"],[\"\\u201cDownward Dog on a Shelf\\u201d I\\u2019m in a basement or a living room that has no windows. There are a lot of people. I see my brother and my stepmother. There\\u2019s something I have to do. I climb up onto a shelf that\\u2019s about eighteen inches wide and maybe four feet long. It\\u2019s tricky to get up there. There are other items on the shelf like it\\u2019s decorated for Christmas. There are pine bows and some Christmas cards. The arrangement goes up the wall and there are a lot of different cards that people have sent to my stepmother. While I\\u2019m up there, I crawl onto my hands and knees, then I lift my knees up and I\\u2019m in a downward dog. I realize I can\\u2019t back down and I\\u2019m stuck up there. I\\u2019m there for a really long time. My legs and arms start to shake. I say, \\u201cI need a little help here, please.\\u201d It\\u2019s still a few minutes before my stepmother comes over to help. She says, \\u201cOkay, what can I do to get you down?\\u201d I ask her if she can move the items off the shelf. She carefully takes them down. There\\u2019s a glass dome - the kind that would go over a lamp - and all these other things I\\u2019m afraid of breaking. She takes them down one by one, thenI can get back down onto my knees, move my hands towards them, then back to the end of the shelf where I can dangle my legs over the edge, hang on with my hands, and kind of jump down the rest of the way. When I get down, I realize that the ornamentation has gone all the way down through the wall. She\\u2019s trying to give people some things to take home, so she has more things to put up there. I\\u2019m being asked if I can take some of the things home, but I don\\u2019t really want them. But I agree anyway. Then, people say it\\u2019s time to sit at the table. Everybody, there\\u2019s about eighteen to twenty people, come to the table that is also so decorated I can hardly move. There is a full place setting with two forks, a knife, a spoon, side plates and multiple glasses. There are all these decorations around them, too. I\\u2019m supposed to be presenting a ring to her in commemoration of some kind of anniversary. I find this out just right now and I\\u2019m being told to sit at the head of the table instead of the side. I\\u2019m sitting there and while we\\u2019re waiting for a few other people to get to the table, somebody reads a poem. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019m going to be required to present something via poetry, also.\\u201d I don\\u2019t have a poem ready and didn\\u2019t even know I was supposed to do this. I leave the table and go back into the living room and am looking at bookshelves. They are filed alphabetically. I think, \\u201cWell, her name starts with M, so If I look under M, maybe I\\u2019ll find something.\\u201d So I pull out this tiny book of Psalms. I look under M and it skips it - it goes from N to P, so I can't find M and O. I put that book back on the shelf and pull out another book that looks like it might be Psalms and poems. I pull it off and it says it\\u2019s M on the outside, but everytime I look at it, there are no M\\u2019s. I close the book and look at the spine and it does say M, so I\\u2019m looking through it again and feeling like I\\u2019m running out of time and people are going to be sitting down and I don\\u2019t have anything prepared! So now I\\u2019m just taking a random book and reading through the poetry. I think it doesn\\u2019t suit her, so I put it back. I think maybe I just didn\\u2019t read it properly because I was in such a rush and maybe it would have suited her. I pull another book off the shelf and do the same thing. Then I see that everyone is at the table, including her. Now I just have to wing it. I put the book back and go back to the table. I don\\u2019t know what to say. I\\u2019m feeling really stressed. When I sit down, there is all this sticky stuff on my forearms from the table. I start to brush it off. My brother says, \\u201cOh, I took a long time putting that there and I liked it that way.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh sorry, I didn\\u2019t realize that was part of the decor. I thought it was just crumbs.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m trying to put it back and smear it around so it looks like it did before I was there. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cFootball Team\\u201d I'm walking through a pine forest. It\\u2019s fairly dense. I\\u2019m moving my arms up over my head in places so I can get my body through. It starts to get a little more sparse, then comes out into a clearing. There\\u2019s snow everywhere. I see up ahead of me a frost fencing and something that looks like it could be a building, although it\\u2019s mostly masked in snow. I walk through the snow towards the frost fencing. A man is standing there and he\\u2019s giving directions of some sort. He indicates that I am supposed to go straight ahead. As I\\u2019m walking through, other people start to gather. It\\u2019s getting a little more crowded. Then I remember I\\u2019m standing in a circle with people. I have something in my hand but i can\\u2019t see what it is. Other people are standing around and I know one of them - Blake. He gives me a bear hug and says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really good to see you.\\u201d As he lifts me up, my feet are off the ground. I can feel my body stretching - it feels like a full body stretch. When he sets me down, I wish he would do it again because the stretching felt really good. We\\u2019re being told to continue on our way towards the building. I notice the guys are wearing football uniforms - jerseys and pants. I wonder if I\\u2019m there for a game.\"],[\"\\u201cOpen Air Concert\\u201d I\\u2019m standing in a crowd in a large fairground area. There is hard packed earth and grass underneath my feet. It\\u2019s dark - it\\u2019s night time. The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn\\u2019t say anything but I know it\\u2019s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There\\u2019s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he\\u2019s somewhat hard although I don\\u2019t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There\\u2019s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren\\u2019t sitting down though, they\\u2019re just standing up. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don\\u2019t want to sit with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I\\u2019m looking for Trent because he\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen and know. I don\\u2019t find him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Shopping Mall\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large urban city. It\\u2019s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can\\u2019t identify where I am because of it. I\\u2019m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I\\u2019ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It\\u2019s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I\\u2019m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says \\u201cyou are here\\u201d and lists the index of all the stores, but I don\\u2019t see one. Because I\\u2019m still looking, I\\u2019m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren\\u2019t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they\\u2019re offering. They\\u2019re all specialty shops. Each store that\\u2019s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they\\u2019re not made of raincoat material or anything; they\\u2019re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they\\u2019ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there\\u2019s very little inventory offered in each. I think, \\u201cWow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.\\u201d Then I figure that whatever it is that they\\u2019re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what\\u2019s in the windows and note in a general way, \\u201cOh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I\\u2019m not even going to look at it.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cAdventures\\u201d I take a taxi to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I arrive and he\\u2019s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I\\u2019m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I\\u2019m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He\\u2019s also wearing something similar. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t really look like pajamas, so it\\u2019s okay to go out in them.\\u201d So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He\\u2019s in the front seat, passenger side. I\\u2019m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I\\u2019ve ever been to the town stadium. I\\u2019m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, \\u201cDo you mean the Place or the Colosseum?\\u201d At the same time as he\\u2019s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He\\u2019s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I\\u2019m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we\\u2019re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It\\u2019s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it\\u2019s glassed in and there\\u2019s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it\\u2019s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there\\u2019s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I\\u2019ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He\\u2019s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I\\u2019m trying to think where I\\u2019ve seen him. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He\\u2019s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they\\u2019re hundreds of years old. They look like they\\u2019re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it\\u2019s old because the lawns aren\\u2019t maincured, but set because they\\u2019ve been cared for so long they don\\u2019t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it\\u2019s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800\\u2019s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you\\u2019re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It\\u2019s just a screen door and is not latched. I can\\u2019t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman\\u2019s voice say, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I answer back, \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It\\u2019s a kitchen. It\\u2019s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it\\u2019s made just for cooking. There\\u2019s a doorway and we go into the next room. There\\u2019s a proper sized eating table in it. There\\u2019s another oven on the wall and I don\\u2019t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it\\u2019s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn\\u2019t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you\\u2019re on the waterfront. We\\u2019re about to go down the steps when I say, \\u201cJust a minute. Let\\u2019s walk back through here again. I noticed something.\\u201d So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, \\u201cLook, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There\\u2019s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn\\u2019t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.\\u201d Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We\\u2019re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I\\u2019m walking. He doesn\\u2019t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It\\u2019s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I\\u2019m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He\\u2019s a little more scared than I. I\\u2019m surprised that he\\u2019s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it\\u2019s like a pig fetus. It\\u2019s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He\\u2019s getting a little scared. It\\u2019s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I\\u2019m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can\\u2019t see it if you\\u2019re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There\\u2019s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there\\u2019s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They\\u2019re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there\\u2019s this other kind of thing that I see. It\\u2019s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to swim in that water.\\u201d Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She\\u2019s clothed and under the water. It looks like she\\u2019s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, \\u201cOh no! We have to save her!\\u201d So, I slip into the water and grab her. She\\u2019s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady\\u2019s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There\\u2019s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she\\u2019s only been hanging onto the pole and she\\u2019s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she\\u2019s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She\\u2019s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, \\u201cLook, she\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I\\u2019m giving her small sips and supporting her head.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Hanson Family Home\\u201d I am at a picnic table outside near the side of a road. There are two picnic tables. Although we can\\u2019t see the cars driving by from this area, I know we\\u2019re right beside a highway. There\\u2019s a gravel shoulder at the edge of a big road on one side of us. There\\u2019s a rough grassy area that\\u2019s speckled with dirt and gravel; there\\u2019s not very much growing there, just a little bit of grass. These two picnic tables are angled in an L-shape. There's a really rough structure, like what you\\u2019d find at a really old gas station store, but there are no gas pumps. So I\\u2019m sitting there and we\\u2019ve got some kind of meal. We\\u2019re evaluating whether or not this thing you sit in can be seen or noticed. One looks like a bathtub and the sides are copper, but it\\u2019s copper coating over enamel and the copper is being used to disguise it; the edges are probably about fourteen inches. There\\u2019s another one where the edges do not come up so high and they are only about six inches tall, but there\\u2019s a lip around the outside. It\\u2019s also been copper coated. We\\u2019re sitting in them on top of the picnic table bench. The other people at the table (not in the tubs) are saying whether or not this is noticeable. We think the shorter one will be less noticable. As it turns out, when we get a good look at them and people are sitting in them, the one that goes up fourteen inches kind of hugs your rib cage and sits under your armpits and because of the copper color, blends in with what people are wearing. You can\\u2019t really notice anyone is sitting in it as they\\u2019re eating. Whereas the other one has that big lip that sticks out and it\\u2019s a vast color difference between the tub and the people\\u2019s bodies and the shape of it is unnatural. So, we\\u2019re reporting back that the shorter one is not a good disguise. Then the scene changes and we\\u2019re in the Hanson\\u2019s house, only there is hardly any furniture in it and in some rooms, there\\u2019s none. The parents are there. The mom especially is more visible than the dad but I know he\\u2019s there somewhere. We walk in the door and the mom is sitting on a ladder facing away from it. She\\u2019s reading something. We go through that room which is empty of furniture. We go into a sitting room with a couch along one wall and where the tv would have been, there is nothing. No one is sitting there. Then we walk into what would have been the dining room. Again, there\\u2019s nothing in it. We go into the kitchen, which is now just an island attached to the wall with cupboards overtop. We walk in between the island and the wall to where the kitchen sink and counter occupy the whole end of the wall. I\\u2019m with Carrie, the youngest member of the family. Her older sister was my best friend in high school and in real life she\\u2019s gone - she died of cancer - but in my dream she\\u2019s still there as a ghost. Carrie and I are trying to wash a mountain of dishes that their four brothers and friends created. It\\u2019s horrible! I pick up one bag off the floor; it\\u2019s a shopping bag that was full of egg salad and some of the egg salad spills out onto the floor. I\\u2019m trying to scoop it up back into the abg. There\\u2019s all this gooped on food and you can\\u2019t even wash the dishes until you sort out dirty dishes from garbage, so we\\u2019re doing that. As we\\u2019re doing that, we\\u2019re hearing a conversation coming from the room with the couch. We\\u2019re both listening and trying to figure out what the two guys are saying. One is one of her middle brothers. He sounds different though. The other is a stranger and we don\\u2019t know who he is. The stranger sounds like he\\u2019s trying to sell something to her brother. We just don\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s trying to sell and it doesn\\u2019t make any sense. Her brother is kind of interested but not responding entirely favorably to the sales pitch. Then there\\u2019s silence - they both fall silent. I said to her: \\u201cDon\\u2019t your parents live in a different house now? Did they keep this house you grew up in? Are just you kids living in it? Are you all splitting the mortgage or rent?\\u201d Then, we turn around and the stranger is coming in through what would have been the eating kitchen. He stands there and addresses us; he\\u2019s trying to give us the same pitch. I\\u2019m highly suspicious of him. He looks and sounds slimy like a salesman trying to sell something that isn\\u2019t authentic. He looks wormy - his body shape is kind of wormy; he\\u2019s really pale and slender and he\\u2019s got tight cropped mousy brown hair and a nondescript face. I automatically don\\u2019t like him. Carrie and I look at each other with a slitty eyed look, like, \\u201cRight this guy\\u2019s gotta go!\\u201d She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll handle this.\\u201d She turns around and says, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d I continue cleaning up the dishes and am making some headway now - I scrape the garbage into one bag and am washing. When I\\u2019m finished, I go into the room where they are. The guy that I thought was her brother was actually a student from my advanced yoga teacher training, only he\\u2019s gained 200 pounds. He\\u2019s wearing an old man\\u2019s housecoat that you put on over your head. You can sort of see the rolls of fat of his body through the mesh of the robe and it has the big cotton pockets on the front. He and Carrie have obviously had some kind of conversation and the stranger is gone. We go back through the room where her mom was sitting on the ladder, but her mom is gone. Now we\\u2019re climbing up the stairs to go to the upper floor with just three bedrooms. Two of the boys share one, the other two share another and Carrie and her sister share the third. But Ellie\\u2019s bed is empty and Carrie is in the room by herself. She answers the question I asked her earlier and says, \\u201cNo, we don\\u2019t have an extra house. This is still our family home.\\u201d I\\u2019m surprised and feel confused because in the pictures, there is furniture in the house and this one doesn\\u2019t look like either home. I look over at Ellie\\u2019s empty bed and it is still the way she left it the last time she slept there. It has the green plaid bedspread and some of the ways she would have creatively decorated their tiny room. There\\u2019s something of mine in the room, too, because I stayed overnight there. I decide to pack my things up and it\\u2019s time to go.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arrangement\\u201d The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor\\u2019s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It\\u2019s some kind of reception, but I\\u2019m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don\\u2019t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he\\u2019s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he\\u2019s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I\\u2019ve earned it. I see in my mind\\u2019s eyes the word, \\u201cPlacement\\u201d on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I\\u2019m talking to them and realize I\\u2019m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It\\u2019s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There\\u2019s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It\\u2019s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It\\u2019s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he\\u2019s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I\\u2019m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I\\u2019m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I\\u2019m moving from one group to another making sure they\\u2019re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I\\u2019m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I\\u2019m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I\\u2019m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It\\u2019s hard for me to do this. I\\u2019m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It\\u2019s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There\\u2019s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I\\u2019m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don\\u2019t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll just sit with you.\\u201d This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There\\u2019s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It\\u2019s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it\\u2019s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I\\u2019m just now understanding this. So I\\u2019m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven\\u2019t had any time to get to know each other. I don\\u2019t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They\\u2019re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what\\u2019s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don\\u2019t. But my arranged husband does. There\\u2019s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we\\u2019re all in my arranged husband\\u2019s car and driving up towards his house. It\\u2019s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I\\u2019m responsible for making food. I\\u2019ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They\\u2019re working on a collaborative project. I\\u2019m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, \\u201cWell, is there anything else I can eat? I\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHere.\\u201d I say here, \\u201cYou can make the toast.\\u201d I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I\\u2019m feeling more at home. I\\u2019m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I\\u2019m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There\\u2019s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I\\u2019ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon. She says, \\u201cNo, all we have is on the racks.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve chosen this chapter book I thought he would like and see it. I tell him that\\u2019s not the book I wanted to get him and describe the stories in the book that I wanted to give him. This builds a little bit more of a bridge between us.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Working Vacation\\u201d I\\u2019m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I\\u2019m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I\\u2019m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn\\u2019t look like that now. There\\u2019s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It\\u2019s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it\\u2019s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They\\u2019re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that\\u2019s really sturdy. I don\\u2019t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it\\u2019s that big. It\\u2019s on its side and they\\u2019re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don\\u2019t really know what they\\u2019re building but they\\u2019re quite busy with it. They\\u2019re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they\\u2019re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they\\u2019re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It\\u2019s a mixed group of boys and girls and it\\u2019s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn\\u2019t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I\\u2019m not really sure what I\\u2019m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it\\u2019s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they\\u2019re doing and it doesn't look like they\\u2019re really doing anything except running around, I\\u2019m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don\\u2019t enter. There\\u2019s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don\\u2019t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn\\u2019t matter in the dream, so I\\u2019ll use the pronoun \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that\\u2019s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they\\u2019ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they\\u2019re exactly the same length and width. I think that\\u2019s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they\\u2019re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they\\u2019re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you want the other shoe?\\u201d The child doesn\\u2019t respond to me. I\\u2019m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I\\u2019m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn\\u2019t. I just wait around and all I\\u2019m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I\\u2019m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I\\u2019m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it\\u2019s a little darker than it is outside. There\\u2019s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It\\u2019s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We\\u2019re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I\\u2019m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She\\u2019s around 8. I notice that she doesn\\u2019t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We\\u2019ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we\\u2019re in a meadow now. We\\u2019re still walking and the sun sets and we\\u2019re in twilight. I wonder if we\\u2019re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don\\u2019t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can\\u2019t sleep. I\\u2019m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they\\u2019re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter\\u2019s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter\\u2019s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what\\u2019s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I\\u2019m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I\\u2019m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that\\u2019s strange. I\\u2019m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, \\u201cI think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.\\u201d She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don\\u2019t have a bathing suit so I\\u2019m just wearing something that won\\u2019t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we\\u2019d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn\\u2019t very big. Then I\\u2019m not sure how we\\u2019re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they\\u2019re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Red Coat\\u201d I\\u2019m in the Central Hotel for a gathering. There are a lot of people. It\\u2019s packed. It feels dark and stuffy. I\\u2019m wearing a red jacket over a dress. Someone who works there takes my jacket and hangs it up for me. I go to sit down at a table. I\\u2019m supposed to meet people there. As I sit down, I realize that everyone is meeting there prior to moving next door for a wedding. I take my seat and am scanning the room for people I know. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I just sit in the seat. I\\u2019m waiting until we are going to be notified that we\\u2019re moving. Then it seems rather sudden that someone from the hotel circulates through the guests telling them it\\u2019s time to move. They\\u2019re saying things that cause us to be hasty and move quickly and not to linger. I get up and move with the flow of the crowd. We exit out the front door and immediately take a left and go into the door beside it, then up a long set of stairs and into a big room. The room we just left was crowded and stuffy but had kind of a homey atmosphere - the decor was of wood with wood posts that held the ceiling up and it had that well oiled hand hewn feel to it. This upstairs room is just one big rectangle that\\u2019s maybe hastily put together. No one sits and stays for a long time. It remains empty. There\\u2019s no warmth when you walk in. There's a long table. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m supposed to sit here. Again, I\\u2019m scanning the room for people I know. I see two people who used to live in my neighborhood and I thought were my friends. They know I\\u2019m there but keep to themselves and make no effort to come talk to me. I seem to know the people I\\u2019m sitting with but I can\\u2019t identify them in the dream. I realize we\\u2019re here for a reception. The servers bring food out. Everybody has the same plate of food. We eat without gusto. The servers take the food away and place dessert on the table. I pick at it. They sit down jugs of beer, but I don\\u2019t normally drink beer. I take a little bit in a cup and it tastes refreshing and very cold. I drink about half my cup. People are getting up out of their seats and moving into smaller groupings. There\\u2019s lively talk coming from these groupings. I feel isolated and unwelcome. I\\u2019m not sure what the reception is for. I get up and circulate a little. There\\u2019s a little dancing. I want to dance but there\\u2019s no one to dance with. I like the music and am feeling the dance in my body but there\\u2019s no one to share it with. I see someone who used to be a neighbor and go down to her. She says hello and talks with me for a few minutes. We sit down in chairs. I go to show her something on Facebook, but there\\u2019s no internet signal and my phone won\\u2019t load it. She gets bored and wanders away while I\\u2019m waiting. I just close my phone up and put it back in my purse. I go into the original room where I saw my old neighbors and they\\u2019re still involved in a conversation. They see me but don\\u2019t wave or beckon me over. I feel like I just want to go home now. Then I realize my red jacket is missing. I ask one of the staff if it\\u2019s possible to go downstairs and get it from the coat rack. They tell me that downstairs is now closed. It\\u2019s really cold out and I need my jacket. Now I'm unsure what to do. I stand by the doorway and another staff person comes up and says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve found three red jackets downstairs. Is one of these yours?\\u201d I think the first one is. It\\u2019s a felt jacket and it\\u2019s long. I put it on as though I recognize it. It\\u2019s comfortable and feels like it fits me. Then I see the other red jacket and think, \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s my grandfather\\u2019s coat.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m mistaken. The one I\\u2019m wearing is not mine. The noisy one is mine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell just keep the other one.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I can't do that, it\\u2019s not mine. It belongs to somebody.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, no one has claimed it. It\\u2019s been here for a long time.\\u201d I take it off and put on my grandfather\\u2019s coat. I\\u2019m holding it because he\\u2019s not giving me anywhere to put it. There are no hangers and he\\u2019s walking away. I feel uncomfortable that I have this coat that\\u2019s not mine. Then I go out the door because now they\\u2019re closing. I have this coat that doesn\\u2019t belong to me over my arm. I\\u2019m not sure how far to go with it, so I stand across the street because i can\\u2019t stay in the building.\"],[\"\\u201cFor a Little While\\u201d I\\u2019m in a village. It\\u2019s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don\\u2019t live in houses. It\\u2019s outside living. People\\u2019s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I\\u2019m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it\\u2019s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I\\u2019m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I\\u2019m waiting for her dad. I know he\\u2019s there but he\\u2019s invisible. He has a presence but I haven\\u2019t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we\\u2019re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I\\u2019m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It\\u2019s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there\\u2019s food you can eat with your fingers that\\u2019s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we\\u2019ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there\\u2019s privacy from everyone else\\u2019s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He\\u2019s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He\\u2019s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he\\u2019s still there in spirit but in the flesh he\\u2019s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we\\u2019re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She\\u2019s looking around. I think to myself, \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for the parents she doesn\\u2019t have.\\u201d I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I\\u2019m happy to look after her. She\\u2019s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter\\u2019s father. I miss that he can\\u2019t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.\"],[\"\\u201cGrief and Ash\\u201d I\\u2019m having a conversation with a woman that continues despite the fact that I need to use the washroom. It continues despite the fact that I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and pushing something out of my body. I\\u2019m pushing shit out of my body. I don't have to strain too hard. My body does evacuate it pretty effortlessly. I can hear other people in the house but it\\u2019s more like white noise rather than distinct conversation. Then the person I\\u2019m talking to continues talking about mundane topics as though I\\u2019m not sitting on the toilet and I\\u2019m not evacuating shit from my body. I can feel my body is finished. Then I take the toilet paper from the roll on the wall, nothing unusual. As I try and wipe the remnants of it from myself, it feels like there\\u2019s gritty stuff like seeds. I wipe again. Now instead of there being less on the paper, there\\u2019s more. I repeat this process about six times. There\\u2019s more each time. I feel like it\\u2019s spreading it around the cheeks of my bum. And so, I think that this process is spreading it around me more. I don\\u2019t want to continue it. I need to go somewhere else where I can get clean. I tell the woman, \\u201cI can\\u2019t talk to you right now. I need to stop this.\\u201d She does leave. I take off all my clothes and get into the shower. I scrub myself from head to toe. I realize that the shower, the water, the soap is making me clean. I stop, rinse myself off and get out. I towel myself off. I feel clean now. But I\\u2019m disgusted at my clothes. I think they carry something. I put them in the washing machine in the bathroom, add some soap, turn the water on and start them. Then the dream continues on. I just can\\u2019t pull any more out of it.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scavenger Hunt\\u201d I\\u2019m in this outdoor space. It\\u2019s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It\\u2019s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they\\u2019re conifers. I don\\u2019t recall any deciduous trees at all. I\\u2019m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there\\u2019s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that\\u2019s hidden for the purpose that it\\u2019s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can\\u2019t see the marks unless you\\u2019re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don\\u2019t have any equipment. We\\u2019re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there\\u2019s some item that\\u2019s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There\\u2019s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What\\u2019s the natural food you do with fish food if there\\u2019s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I\\u2019m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it\\u2019s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it. Then it submerges itself. Right after that, an even bigger fish starts swimming up to the surface. It\\u2019s about twelve feet long! We all start running out. It\\u2019s the mother. There was only one piece of food and we\\u2019re thinking that we might be the other food. Each one of these spots has hazards and the thing you\\u2019re supposed to solve. Some people are able to remember three red dots and they just keep moving back. Other people can only remember one at a time so they go back down to the bottom of the hill and look through the night vision glass again. One of these times when I go back down there Omar is there. We group together to do our scavenger hunt. We have to go quite far. It\\u2019s a lot farther out than some of the ones that are closeby. There is a long climb up a tree then you have to move from the tree onto a rock cliff face. We swing onto the rock. There\\u2019s a forest ranger lookout tower and we climb up it. He finds all this survival equipment - tiny packages of dehydrated food wrapped in plastic and shirts with long sleeves individually wrapped in plastic. They\\u2019re the kind of shirt that protects you from the sun. There are other things also wrapped in plastic. Because he got there first, he has this big box. Luckily I was there, too, because it\\u2019s really impossible to hold a box and climb back down to the night vision pane of glass. So he hands me the box, then climbs down, then I hand him the box and climb down. This is how we get down. Once we get down, he is tasked with needing to divide the contents of the box equally between all the participants of this scavenger hunt. While he\\u2019s doing this, I go and find more of the marks. When I come back, he\\u2019s finished the task. Apparently, it\\u2019s my job to disperse the packages he\\u2019s divided and give one to each person. For some reason, he\\u2019s written really, really tiny and the ink of the pen he was using is really blotchy and runs out sometimes. It\\u2019s really hard to read the names. I\\u2019m trying to guess some of them. I do. I have another pen and am writing on the top trying to fill in the blanks. It starts to get dark. There\\u2019s one more task to finish. I go up the hill to a grassy area. There\\u2019s a lawnmower. Those two things go together. What do you do with a lawnmower? You cut grass. Only it\\u2019s really tricky because the grass is growing on the side of a slope and it\\u2019s pretty much a vertical rise. That\\u2019s the only long grass. I\\u2019m trying to push the lawnmower up and then guide it back down so it doesn\\u2019t flip over and cut my feet with the blade. I do this. It\\u2019s dark. This man comes over and comments that I\\u2019ve done a good job. The other tricky part about doing this is that there are some plants - angel\\u2019s trumpet - growing on that slope. You wouldn\\u2019t cut that with your lawnmower. So I have to be careful to get the grass without damaging the angel's trumpet. I finish this and then leave the lawnmower. At this point, there\\u2019s some kind of alarm raised. Everybody is running. There is some chaos. I see someone I know. I run over to her and ask if she knows what\\u2019s going on. She\\u2019s not sure and says I should stay here. This is one of the flat spots, a plateau. Others are gathering here, too. I see Omar and realize I didn\\u2019t finish dispersing all the survival kits. I can feel the fear in people as we\\u2019re standing and waiting to see if we have eased the threat by finding the marks and solving the puzzles, doing what we need to do? This question is just hanging in there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Symphony\\u201d I\\u2019m at my friends Maggie and Joey\\u2019s house, only it\\u2019s not their house, it\\u2019s the old Farm House. Maggie and Joey live there. I\\u2019ve gone up to visit them. Maggie has all kinds of little interesting things for us to do. We\\u2019re making jelly at one point. Then we go into a different room and are doing a craft. We\\u2019re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he\\u2019s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That\\u2019s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on with him because he\\u2019s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, \\u201cCome and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he\\u2019s wearing a tux.\\u201d I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some \\u201cdoing of the hair.\\u201d I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She\\u2019s got several things that she\\u2019s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don\\u2019t think anything of this. I think she\\u2019s just seeing how this will look or how these two items will look if you put them together. Then she says to me, \\u201cI can\\u2019t go. I\\u2019m really sick. I don\\u2019t feel up to this. But it\\u2019s something Joey really wants to do.\\u201d I ask her, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re sick?\\u201d She tells me she\\u2019s been sick for a really long time and she thinks that her time is limited. I feel this grief moving up through my feet, through my legs and into my heart. It kind of suspends all my decision making qualities. I\\u2019m just standing there trying to take this all in. i look at her really closely, looking for traces of truth, not of her words, but that her body is actually that sick. I\\u2019m looking at her skin and the sclera of her eyes. I\\u2019m trying to see what I have not noticed before and wasn\\u2019t aware of. Then I tell her I don\\u2019t want to go to the symphony and she should do this because it\\u2019s something special and they\\u2019ve been planning it for a long time. Then suddenly her hair is drawn back into a formal style with a bun at the back of her head. She\\u2019s wearing earrings that dangle down from her ears. She\\u2019s dressed in a strapless gown. She looks beautiful. We go back down the stairs. This time she disappears into the kitchen. I\\u2019m in the living room and Joey is standing there. I say, \\u201cI hope you guys have a really good time. This will be wonderful. You two look fabulous.\\u201d He comes over and gives me a hug. His face is overtop my left shoulder. I can feel that he\\u2019s crying. He says, \\u201cI hope you're still here when we get back.\\u201d Now I just feel kind of numb. I feel heavy. I no longer know what to do while they\\u2019re gone and I don\\u2019t want to stay in the house but I do. I look outside down the long farmhouse style driveway. All the earth looks frozen. The trees are bare. There\\u2019s no growth left in the ground. It\\u2019s nighttime. Even in the activity that was in the house of jamming things in jars and making preserves is tucked away. The house feels empty. I think, \\u201cMaybe I should just have a bath and go to bed.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cOld School\\u201d I\\u2019m both in the place when it existed in its own time and again later as some kind of impermanent guest. In the dream, when it starts, I\\u2019m living there. Then it\\u2019s almost like the time I spent actually living there is a memory I\\u2019m unaware of as I re-enter it. The setting is a cleared area in a forest. The structures are really rustic; they\\u2019ve been hand-hewn and erected without machines. Everything has been done by hand. In fact, the floor inside one of the structures, the one I\\u2019m in, is made of gravel and wood chips and it\\u2019s quite chunky. I\\u2019m inside one of these structures in the village and looking out the window. I look at the other structures from the window and think, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s interesting. When they resurrected this, they put them in a different spot than they originally were.\\u201d I notice that the windows aren\\u2019t made of glass, but something a little opaque. I\\u2019m not quite sure what the material is. I\\u2019m inside one of these and it\\u2019s definitely the biggest of the structures and has two floors. I don\\u2019t go to the upper floor. I\\u2019m sitting on something and it\\u2019s not really a couch - it\\u2019s something stuffed with straw or horse hair. I\\u2019ve got a binder with me. I take it out and it\\u2019s study notes. I realize that I should have looked at these earlier because I actually have a lesson plan that\\u2019s due today. I'm not worried though. I think. \\u201cAh, that\\u2019s fine. I just have to sit here and sit still and do it.\\u201d So I start to read through the instructions and I hear some people talking in one of the other rooms. I stand up and walk over the rough floor and sure enough there are two other people. I\\u2019m wearing headphones at this point. One of the men is telling a story to the other man sitting there about how he got one of his jobs and a job he was quite happy with. He had been called in to fill in for someone else. He had some kind of project and no one had ever seen this kind of projector before. It put all of the work he needed to teach up on a whiteboard and it was really easy, it was compact, it was able to stream a whole bunch of different things into one machine. The way he told the story, people were marveling at it, asking him where he got it, etc. He had picked it up from somewhere exotic. They had called him in to do this kind of work in this school on a regular basis and they hadn\\u2019t hired anyone for years and years and years apparently, according to him. What he didn't realize is that my headphones were picking up the entire conversation he was having with his friend. His friend realized this and said, \\u201cI see we have someone else on the line.\\u201d He said, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s just Lynn.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re right, my headphones are picking it up, but I\\u2019m not Lynn.\\u201d Then I try to reach around to my ears and see if I can find some buttons that would turn off their conversation, although it had been interesting. I actually want quiet so I can do my own work. I leave the area where they had been making contact with each other. I realize as I was leaving that they weren\\u2019t even there and the whole thing was a hologram. I go back to my binder and sit on the stuffed cushion. I hear someone coming down the stairs from the upper floor. It\\u2019s a woman. I tell her that I\\u2019m going to do these lesson plans here. She just acknowledges that and drifts off. I don\\u2019t see her again. As I\\u2019m looking through the lesson plan, someone from my headphones asks me what I want to teach when I finish my program. I don\\u2019t know who it is - it\\u2019s like a disembodied voice. I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve worked with kids before and I really don\\u2019t think I want to put that much physical energy into my day, plus they get sick a lot. I really want to be in an environment where there\\u2019s not so much illness. Middle school, eh, that\\u2019s a lot of work, too, but in a different way. Maybe?\\u201d I realize that as I\\u2019m telling this, I want to teach high school because the environment is generally cleaner in terms of illness. You don\\u2019t need as much equipment because the kids don\\u2019t need to be entertained. I\\u2019m thinking that if I had the same technology that I overheard the man talking about in the other room, then the high school kids would be engaged and it\\u2019s really quite compact and doesn\\u2019t take up much space. I put this to voice and say, \\u201cYou know, I think I want to teach high school kids.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cRed Sand\\u201d I\\u2019m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I\\u2019m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it\\u2019s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it\\u2019s actually ending. She\\u2019s co-teaching with another person I\\u2019ve never seen. I think it\\u2019s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I\\u2019ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It\\u2019s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they\\u2019ve obviously already had their asana class and they\\u2019re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it\\u2019s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we\\u2019re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she\\u2019s white, if the whole class was like this or if it\\u2019s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it\\u2019s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I\\u2019m surprised to see her. She says, \\u201cNo, the whole class was like this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d So I ask her, \\u201cIs this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d There are six people. I think, \\u201cWow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.\\u201d Then I say to her, \\u201cI have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.\\u201d I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I\\u2019m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don\\u2019t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that\\u2019s leaving. As I\\u2019m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don\\u2019t even know what they are. But I\\u2019m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith\\u2019s flute looks like an obo, but it\\u2019s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it\\u2019s such beautiful music. You can tell they\\u2019ve played together for a really long time because they\\u2019re really tight together. They\\u2019re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there\\u2019s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I\\u2019ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, \\u201cGood, we\\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\\u201d The music has something to do with what they\\u2019ve been practicing in the class. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, \\u201cI hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.\\u201d We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we\\u2019re at the outskirts of town. He says, \\u201cLook what they\\u2019re going to put on this land.\\u201d He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he\\u2019s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he\\u2019s doing this, I\\u2019m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, \\u201cOh, I think there\\u2019s red clay under this.\\u201d I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, \\u201cLook. There\\u2019s red sand underneath here.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just spray painted. I say, \\u201cI don't think so, it looks real. It\\u2019s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.\\u201d He\\u2019s quiet and doesn\\u2019t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he\\u2019s adding onto it so it\\u2019s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.\"],[\"\\u201cQuest for a Job\\u201d I\\u2019m at the restaurant where I worked during university. I\\u2019m sitting at a booth across from the pizza oven with a friend. We\\u2019re not there for me to look for a job and I\\u2019m not working there. We\\u2019re just there because he\\u2019s hungry. He\\u2019s eating a salad. Overtop of the booth, I see one of the people I used to work with. He\\u2019s in uniform. I peak up over the booth. We make eye contact and say, \\u201cHey. Wow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long.\\u201d I ask him, \\u201cAre you working here again?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I say, \\u201cSo they\\u2019re hiring again?\\u201d There\\u2019s been some kind of hiring freeze. He says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I wonder if they\\u2019ll rehire me because I really need a job. I look to see who the manager is. I\\u2019m looking around the floor from my seat and see that it\\u2019s George. He had stopped working there just shortly before I did. So I\\u2019m also surprised. Eventually he comes back to the pizza oven. We make eye contact and I wave to him and say, \\u201cHey, when did you start working here again?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNot that long ago.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWould you take an application from me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cHere, I\\u2019m too busy to talk. Just follow me around for a little while.\\u201d So I do. We go back into the prep area and into the walk-in fridge. I\\u2019m trying to find out who the owner is and if it\\u2019s the same ones who bought it when we all left our jobs. He says, \\u201cIt is the same ones, but\\u2026\\u201d and he doesn\\u2019t finish the rest of the sentence. I see a couple of other people I have not seen since high school and one who never worked at the restaurant, but he\\u2019s sitting there dressed in prep clothes. So, I\\u2019m waiting for George to finish the sentence and he goes into the dish pit. I follow him. I grab a few dishes because it\\u2019s really busy and I\\u2019m starting to help out. We go back into the area where we pick up the food plates. We go over to the bar. While he\\u2019s doing something there I put some dirty glasses into the dishwasher. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019m not even dressed for this but I\\u2019m doing all this stuff. This feels wrong.\\u201d I walk up to the hostess stand and there's a line-up. I\\u2019m like, alright, this is a bad idea. I\\u2019m not dressed for this. I\\u2019m not even wearing proper shoes. This isn\\u2019t safe. I walk back towards the table where my friend is still sitting and waiting for me. I explain that they\\u2019re hiring, but I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to put an application in. I say, \\u201cMaybe we should just go home. I\\u2019ll drop you off and then I\\u2019ll pick up a resum\\u00e9 from my house and come back.\\u201d Except it\\u2019s really late and I\\u2019m afraid that by the time I do that, the restaurant will be closed. So now I\\u2019m trying to ask George when the next time he\\u2019ll be here so I can bring a resum\\u00e9 back. He says, \\u201cJust wait.\\u201d I say, \\u201cokay,\\u201d and I just sit there at the table and wait. Eventually things slow down and he comes back over and says, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019m not working again until Thursday.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cHmm, he only has two shifts a week.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t really want to wait that long if they\\u2019re hiring because everybody wants a job. I would like to put my application in sooner rather than later.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell there is another way of doing this. Follow me.\\u201d So we go out the side door through the closed patio and down towards the end of the mall. In reality there\\u2019s only one store between them and the end of the mall. But, in my dream, it turns into a dream I had previously where I was with the owner and somebody\\u2019s car was broken down (the dream is called the Diode) and we go down to the end of the mall. There\\u2019s this complex series of diodes store that we enter. I\\u2019m thinking in this dream, \\u201cWow, this is the same store that I had in my dream!\\u201d I start to tell this to George: \\u201cYou know what\\u2019s really weird? I had a dream that this store existed a few months ago even though it didn\\u2019t, and now it does!\\u201d He just looks at me and says, \\u201cHmm, it\\u2019s always been here.\\u201d We enter the doorway of the electronics store. It\\u2019s the same kind of squirrel\\u2019s nest of all kinds of tightly packed boxes of switches and diodes. We go upstairs. There are two big doors made of wood at the top of the stairs and a small vestibule in front of it. I realize I don\\u2019t have my mask. I turn around and say this to George, but as I reach into my pocket, I feel it - it\\u2019s in there. I pull it out and say, \\u201cNevermind, I do have it.\\u201d I continue going through the doors. Then I open one door and it\\u2019s a poolhall and I can smell cigarette smoke. I close the door quickly and turn around to George and say, \\u201cAre you sure? What are we doing here? It\\u2019s a poolhall and stinks of cigarettes.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo this is the right place. You can wait here if you want.\\u201d He goes in and goes all the way to the end of the room, gets something and comes out. He says, \\u201cOkay, here, this is it. You can fill this out instead of the application.\\u201d it\\u2019s folded in half lengthwise. But it\\u2019s this twenty-five page dossier that wants all kinds of information - banking records, genealogy of your family, and it\\u2019s crazy the amount of personal information they want. I look at him and say, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the only other way of applying.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t you just take my resum\\u00e9?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIf you can go home and get it before close time, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d So we walk back through the stripmall into the side of the building. I see another person who worked there when I did has already put in another application. I\\u2019m starting to feel anxious that I\\u2019m not going to make this window of opportunity. By the time I fill out this twenty-five page book, it\\u2019s all going to be gone. I thank him and leave. I drop my friend off and drive home. It\\u2019s pitch dark. I go upstairs, find a resum\\u00e9, put it in a plastic sleeve and turn around to go back. But it\\u2019s already the next day. When I arrive, the restaurant is busy. I\\u2019m dressed better this time. I\\u2019m wearing the black jeans and the proper black shoes, but not the apron and shirt. I see there\\u2019s another manager on duty who I don\\u2019t know. I try to catch her eye but she\\u2019s busy, so I sit down at the bar and wait patiently. Eventually she comes back. I hand her my resum\\u00e9 and ask if it\\u2019s okay. She says, \\u201cHmm, let me see it.\\u201d She looks at it and says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not quite the right person we were looking for.\\u201d I let her know I used to work here with all of the other people that have been recently rehired. She says, \\u201cThank you, but no anyway.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why but I start to feel really old, really depleted, really horrible. I wonder if I\\u2019m ever going to be able to get a job that\\u2019s enough to support my family.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Courtroom\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure when this dream starts if I\\u2019m just observing and then become one of the people or if I was one of the people all along. I\\u2019m in a courthouse. I can see it from the outside - the big wide stairs, the huge pillars, the giant doors, the big spacious hallways that are made of marble, the floor is really slippery and looks wet but it is not. This is the part where I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m just observing or if I\\u2019m one of the people. In the hallway there are just a couple of people. I\\u2019m walking through it trying to find some justice. I can feel this tight ball of outrage mixed with grief in the middle of my chest. I wonder which courtroom I\\u2019m supposed to be in. as I\\u2019m looking at each door, I\\u2019m looking for some sign that this will be where my case will be heard. There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there\\u2019s four, then eight, then sixteen; they\\u2019re multiplying exponentially. Then they\\u2019re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it\\u2019s all just men. Then there are so many that there\\u2019s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They\\u2019re only inches away from me and now there\\u2019s even more. I\\u2019m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, \\u201cThese aren't regular men. Look, this man\\u2019s gay.\\u201d As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there\\u2019s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They\\u2019re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there\\u2019s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that\\u2019s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they\\u2019re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that\\u2019s the end of it. But then they regain their footing and they start to make some space again as they\\u2019re running down the next hallway. Then I\\u2019m in the crowd, I\\u2019m not just watching. I\\u2019m looking for a place where we can blend in so the people who are chasing us won\\u2019t recognize us. Or is there a door that isn\\u2019t just a courtroom but actually leads to someplace we can hide. So this goes on. The hallways are endless. There\\u2019s nowhere to blend in because someone keeps recognizing us. Then at one point, there\\u2019s enough distance between us and the people chasing us. I open one of the doors. You can hardly see that it\\u2019s a door because it\\u2019s a white door within a white wall. I open it up and run in. it\\u2019s got a push-in button lock. I can feel somebody on the other side of the door. The door handle is in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to push the button, but the person is turning the door so that the button keeps popping out. It keeps happening over and over and over again. Then I think this is it and I\\u2019m done for. Then I hear this voice on the other side saying, \\u201cPlease let me in!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAlright it\\u2019s not someone trying to chase, but someone trying to hide.\\u201d I open the door up and this big round man comes in. I think we\\u2019re not going to fit in here because he\\u2019s so big. But we do. Now he's in front of me. I think to myself that if someone opens the door, they\\u2019re not even going to see me because he\\u2019s so big he\\u2019s filling up the space. Then I can feel that his body feels soft and doughy, it\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s absorbing me. I think, \\u201cWell, at least it\\u2019s not uncomfortable.\\u201d Then I hear the crowd and the noises of the feet pounding and the yelling. They\\u2019re getting closer and closer and closer. Then they\\u2019re right outside the door. I feel them going a little away and then they\\u2019re gone in the distance. Then it\\u2019s quiet. I start to let out my breath. My heart\\u2019s pounding so hard that I can\\u2019t breathe. It starts to subside a bit. I get an inhale again. After some minutes, I\\u2019m starting to breathe again. Both of us are scared to open the door. It\\u2019s pitch dark in here because there is no justice here. It\\u2019s quiet for long enough that the building sounds empty. I think the fight has just gone on outside. It didn\\u2019t disappear, it\\u2019s somewhere. We open the door, go into the dark hallways. There\\u2019s no one in the building. It sounds like no one is in here. We walk down the hallways until we see the door back to the street. The street is dark. This other person just disappears. I\\u2019m walking and wondering where to go. Then I see one shop that looks open. It looks like a curio shop. I open the door. It has one of those cowbells on the top and makes the cowbell noise. An elderly woman comes out. She tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m over here if you need me.\\u201d She disappears into the piles and piles of stuff. I go off into the room to the right. I don\\u2019t have any money. At first it just looks like junk, broken, dusty, dirty things. I don\\u2019t even really want to sort through them. Then as I look at things more closely I think it\\u2019s not just piles of junk, but actually antique furniture. You can see where she started to decorate the furniture to make it look like a store with lamps and tablecloths and little ornaments around those. But as no one was buying anything, she\\u2019s collecting and hoarding them. Eventually you couldn\\u2019t tell where the arrangement was and where it was just things upon things upon things. But I become interested in the layers because it\\u2019s the furniture I\\u2019m trying to decipher. In one corner of one room, I\\u2019ve sorted my way into it. I\\u2019m interested in this desk because it looks like there is a secret compartment in it somewhere. So I\\u2019m moving things around, taking all this stuff off it...broken picture frames and I wonder who these people are and setting them somewhere else. I\\u2019m moving the lamps. There are too many broken things that I can\\u2019t tell what\\u2019s what. But once I move a lot of the broken stuff, I can start to see actual things. I move the lamp. There\\u2019s a kitchen utensil and it\\u2019s old enough that I don\\u2019t recognize it. I\\u2019m wondering what it was used for. Then I\\u2019ve cleared enough of the space on top of the desk that I can open it. It\\u2019s one of those roll tops that rolls back into itself. Now there\\u2019s stuff inside and it\\u2019s just crammed with stuff! So I have to move all these other things. Suddenly there\\u2019s a man beside me. I recognize him as this guy who I talked to for a little while then realized he wasn\\u2019t a very nice person so I stopped talking to him. Every word he said was so insincere. He says to me, \\u201cLook, there are two little pieces of wood at the back of this. If you lift them up, it exposes a secret compartment.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, how did you know this? There was so much stuff in front of this.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been in here for a really, really long time.\\u201d Then he goes back to sitting on the floor. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s a prisoner there and he\\u2019s trapped somehow. I\\u2019m looking to see what was in this compartment. It\\u2019s cartons, like the kind of boxes that look like shoe boxes but are made of pretty material...or maybe it\\u2019s wallpaper over cardboard. But you see older ladies with them. They wrap things in material and tissue paper so dust moths don\\u2019t eat them. There are a whole bunch of these stacked in here. I wonder if this actually belongs to the old lady who has this store. I find her. I go into the other room and find her and say, \\u201cOne of the desks in the other room has a secret compartment.\\u201d She looks at me with some surprise and affection and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019ve found it!\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell let me know if you need any help, I\\u2019ll be over here.\\u201d I think she doesn\\u2019t mind that I\\u2019m looking through all this stuff and sorting it. I go back into the first room and am thinking that it\\u2019s okay to look through all these things! I\\u2019m sorting them into different piles. I leave the desk open the way I found it. I go across the room. The man is still there and he has his eyes closed like he\\u2019s trapped. It looks like he can\\u2019t move away from that spot. In this one corner of the room, I\\u2019m sorting through things and I find this beautiful string of lights. There are only five lights on it. It looks like hand-blown glass. The blue is a beautiful color. In fact, you can see the different elements in the blue that would have been exposed when the glassblower was blowing it to make the bulb. You can see bits of orange and terracotta and different shades of this deep carnival royal blue. I\\u2019m admiring them and thinking, \\u201cWow, here\\u2019s this beautiful thing hidden amidst all of this junk.\\u201d I set them carefully aside. Now I find a picture with a round oval frame. It looks like me when I was a little girl. I set that beside the string of blue lights. I wonder what else is in here that maybe once belonged to me when I was young. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cEscape\\u201d I\\u2019m in a grey cement building. It looks like the Hoover Dam - it\\u2019s that tall and made of cement like that. It\\u2019s dark. There\\u2019s water on the floor, about an inch of it, and it feels damp and cold. I\\u2019m inside with three people. We\\u2019re taking turns sleeping in shifts. We can only sleep for a maximum of eight minutes. We\\u2019re practicing a rotation that we can take this copper wire thing and roll it up into a key. It\\u2019s kind of shaped like a paperclip. We have to take it out of its shape and roll it into two other things within a certain amount of time. One of the shapes, you take one end and it ends up looking something like a flower. And the other, I\\u2019ve already forgotten what it looks like. We\\u2019re really, really tired. Everybody wants to sleep more than we are, but we can\\u2019t because we\\u2019re training ourselves to escape this place. We\\u2019ve got this old lumpy mattress on the floor so it keeps you off the water. There\\u2019s one set of sheets. The person who\\u2019s sleeping gets to stretch out and the rest of us are just sitting on something like one of those trundle buggies or wheely carts where you put things in them for shopping and they have a handle. Homeless people use them or the elderly. So we\\u2019re sitting on that to keep us up out of the water. So you not only have to be able to snap out of your sleep quickly, you also have to be dropped into your sleep quickly. If we can do all of this within eight minutes - fall asleep, wake up, fold the wire into the two different shapes - then we\\u2019re sure we can manage our escape. Everybody has to go through the rotation and there are four of us all together. So we do this. It repeats in the dream four times. One person has a really hard time waking up and it\\u2019s making all of us anxious. We\\u2019re shaking her and saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta get up! You\\u2019ve gotta get up!\\u201d She finally wakes up. We make her go through that a couple more times so she is waking up at the proper time. When she does, we take the sheets of the bed, but we have to leave the top cover on so it looks like people are still sleeping there because there\\u2019s somebody that comes around and checks and if they realize we\\u2019re gone before we\\u2019re all the way out of the building then we might get caught. So we have to practice taking the sheet off without disturbing the top cover. I\\u2019m actually quite good at this. We do it and I\\u2019m instructing the others, telling them how to do it. We do it, fold it up and put everything in this trundle buggie and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cGoats and Ethics\\u201d I\\u2019ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I\\u2019m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I\\u2019m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, \\u201cHmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really find any. Then I decide I\\u2019m not worried about it because I\\u2019ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I\\u2019m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I\\u2019ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don\\u2019t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I\\u2019m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He\\u2019s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, \\u201cYou have to see this, come with me.\\u201d We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn\\u2019t a yard; it\\u2019s a pool of water. But it doesn\\u2019t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, \\u201cThis is just amazing. You have to see this.\\u201d We bend down and look into the lake. She says, \\u201cLook what I found.\\u201d I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it\\u2019s not made of cement; it\\u2019s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, \\u201cLook! It\\u2019s a goat path.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don\\u2019t understand how it\\u2019s for goats.\\u201d So we\\u2019re kneeling at the side and she says, \\u201cLook.\\u201d I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re post holes.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.\\u201d She presses something and they start to go up - they\\u2019re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, \\u201cAt one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.\\u201d I think, \\u201cI wonder what the value is in that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell they would have used it when they were threatened.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, then, still I don\\u2019t understand what the goats did.\\u201d Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it\\u2019s not wood that things are made of and the reason they\\u2019ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, \\u201cWow, this is incredible.\\u201d Now other students are coming out and it\\u2019s 4:30. I realize it\\u2019s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can\\u2019t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can\\u2019t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.\"],[\"\\u201cSmoking\\u201d I\\u2019m on foot and it\\u2019s nighttime. I\\u2019m walking through a long flat path. There are a couple of other people with me - my ex friend Lisa and Keith - and a couple of other people. It\\u2019s pitch black out, the night sky has no moon and no stars. It\\u2019s not unpleasant - it\\u2019s not rainy or snowy - it\\u2019s just dark. We walk for quite some time. We are supposedly going to Keith\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s a cottage or something. We get there and his mom is home. We are supposed to just be stopping to say hi to her, change our clothes, and then put the boat in the water. I\\u2019ve already walked around the backyard to see where the boat is. I\\u2019m looking at the water. Everybody seems to be taking a long time, so I go back into the house. They\\u2019re involved in quite a conversation with his mom. I\\u2019m waiting for them to finish talking and I sit down. Then Omar walks into the room and he sits down. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re all talking but they\\u2019re not talking about anything, they\\u2019re just waiting. Eventually I sit down, too. I wonder why they\\u2019re sitting and waiting. I wonder what they're waiting for. I decide I might as well have a nap. There\\u2019s a pullout couch and it\\u2019s already been pulled out. I lie down on it. His mom comes over and sits beside me but she doesn\\u2019t say anything. She\\u2019s still in this kind of limbo. I\\u2019m not actually tired, I\\u2019m just lying down. Then the other guys get up as though they\\u2019re going to put their outdoor clothing on. I think we\\u2019re going, so I sit up on the corner on the pullout couch. But they\\u2019re not going; they\\u2019re passing around a joint. Then they go into this limbo again afterwards. I\\u2019m not sleepy, I\\u2019m just lying down because there\\u2019s nothing else to do. It\\u2019s pitch black. We\\u2019ve walked all the way there and I\\u2019m not going to walk home. I can\\u2019t go out in the boat by myself. Nobody is talking. I lie back down on the bed again. Then Keith comes over and he gives the joint to his mom. I wonder what\\u2019s in it and maybe it\\u2019s not a joint, but just looks like one. She puts it to her lips then takes it away and gives it to me. I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder what this is.\\u201d I put it to my lips. The smoke feels weird. I don\\u2019t like it. I take it away from my own lips and give it back to Keith. Then I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re all in limbo. They\\u2019re high.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cLittle Animals with Trunks on the Movie Set\\u201d This dream starts at the restaurant where I worked while at university. It\\u2019s a continuation of another dream where I heard they were hiring and I brought my application in. It starts by me meeting there with a bunch of other people I used to hang around with when I worked there. We are meeting there and it\\u2019s a Sunday night. We\\u2019re going to see a concert and the reason we\\u2019re meeting there is because the manager or one of the bartenders (I\\u2019m not sure who) has picked up a bulk purchase of tickets and we have access to them as employees at this bulk rate. I\\u2019ve been included in this. I\\u2019m feeling hopeful that I have a job there because I\\u2019ve been included. So, it\\u2019s shift change and I'm sitting at the bar with everyone else. Some of the staff are eating, which is typical - they\\u2019re getting their meal at the end of their shift. Some staff come in earlier and eat their staff meal before their shift starts. So there are a lot of people around and it\\u2019s a festive atmosphere. The people that have finished their shift are buoyant because they\\u2019re counting their tips. The people that are starting their shift are buoyant because there\\u2019s an anticipation of the money they\\u2019re going to make. There\\u2019s always good music playing there. I see people I went to highschool with. Their uniforms are all fresh and I can tell they\\u2019ve just been hired that day. I have a conversation with two of them. The tickets go around and I take mine. We\\u2019re figuring out who\\u2019s going to carpool with who and in what car. We\\u2019re waiting for the schedule to go up because it\\u2019s Sunday night. George, the manager, disappears into the back and somebody comments that he\\u2019s taking a long time to work on it. The crowd is thinning because people have finished their meal or left with their ticket and carpool or are on the floor starting to take care of their section. I\\u2019m still waiting to see if I\\u2019m on it because I\\u2019ve been included in this. George hasn\\u2019t come out from the back yet. I ask the owner who personally gave me a package with my ticket in it. Now I remember that they also had a small birthday celebration for me. Several people have given me a birthday gift and I didn\\u2019t expect this. I ask the owner if he knows if I\\u2019m on the schedule. He says he doesn\\u2019t know. He takes my hand and then leaves. One of the other managers is standing there, so I ask him. He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He has a sad look on his face. I feel really dejected and don\\u2019t even want to go to the concert now. I\\u2019m wondering why not only everybody who used to work with me has been re-hired, but these other people that went to highschool with and who never even worked there before have been hired. I leave. I get on the bus to go home. The bus is leaving and it does go down P. Road, but it stops and I disembark. It\\u2019s not just a bus stop, it\\u2019s an intersection of all different kinds of transportation. There\\u2019s a big ship at the dock. There are skateboards. There\\u2019s a snowmobile. There are other things I don\\u2019t remember. At first I choose a skateboard and it\\u2019s interesting because it is snowing. I\\u2019m surprised that as I go up a hill with snow that I can maneuver on this - it\\u2019s a combination of pressing my right foot down, then the left foot lifts up a little, and then you use your body weight and your center of gravity to heave it forward - it\\u2019s similar to skiing. I get up this very small hill then get some momentum and it\\u2019s going along in the snow. When I look down I can see the snowmobile tracks in the snow and they\\u2019ve hardened a bit in the cold, and it\\u2019s actually helping my skateboard to move along. I do this for a little while then get off the skateboard. Now I\\u2019m on some other kind of vehicle. It\\u2019s flying over the snow and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It has a steering mechanism. I am zooming along. It\\u2019s wide and there are a couple other people on it. I look over to the side and there are trees flying by. I can see an animal through the trees. I can\\u2019t figure out what kind of animal it is. At first I think it\\u2019s a warthog. Then I think it\\u2019s too big to be a warthog. Then I get a better glimpse of it. You know when things are speeding by and at first you can\\u2019t see something but then it\\u2019s almost like the thing that are speeding by are so fast that it looks like a motion picture and you can see what the other object is? It looks like a hippopotamus except it has wings and a trunk. Then I see all these other strange pictures. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow! This is the set from a Harry Potter movie!\\u201d I get excited about this. We get off at the next stop. Now my son is there and he gets off with me. I say, \\u201cDid you see that?!\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe animal through the trees!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, what did you see?!\\u201d I describe the process of first thinking it was a warthog then realizing what it was. He says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go take a look at the set!\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYou know what? If that\\u2019s the movie set, then we could actually rewatch that movie and look carefully at that scene through the trees and maybe see us flying by.\\u201d He gets really excited about this, too, and we decide to do that when we get home. Then we walk back the way we came on the vehicle. It\\u2019s taking us a little while to walk because we need to go back to that intersection of vehicles in order to get on one that will take us home. We\\u2019re almost there. We\\u2019re walking down the little hill that I skateboarded up with the snow. Then we decide to go off to the left and see if we can see anything else from the movie set. We get closer to it and there are extras and the caterers and those kinds of people milling about and doing their thing. There\\u2019s a commotion. We follow along with the crowd so we can see what the commotion is about. It\\u2019s a horse and it\\u2019s kicking another horse. I\\u2019m horrified. It\\u2019s just awful. I can hear the people on the set gasping and saying, \\u201cTake that thing out of the horse costume!\\u201d What\\u2019s happening is one of these trunked creatures is dressed up as a horse and the other horse thinks that the first horse\\u2019s spirit is bad so it\\u2019s kicking it because it doesn\\u2019t understand it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s another creature in it. They get the first horse calmed down and they remove the horse skin from the other one and put it into this pen. But the pen is a pit. There are a whole bunch of them in it and it\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s so inhumane. They\\u2019re all writhing around and all you can see are these little trunks. It\\u2019s so awful I wake up because I can\\u2019t stand looking at this or seeing this.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and it seems like some kind of celebration. It almost feels like a Christmas Open House or an informal reception of some sort. I\\u2019m wandering through the house looking for somebody I know. I don't see anybody when I go through the first three rooms. When I get to the backroom, I see my friend Kenny. He\\u2019s sitting with one of his sisters and both of his parents. I\\u2019m comfortable with them so I stay there. I don\\u2019t mingle. I just have conversations in turn with each of them until the event starts to wind down and the crowd starts to thin. Kenny leaves. I\\u2019m still taking to his sister; we\\u2019re having a bonding conversation about being the mother of boys. It\\u2019s time for her to go home and it\\u2019s just the parents left. They ask me if I would like a ride and I accept. I get into the car. I don\\u2019t know what happens to the mom, maybe we dropped her off earlier. I\\u2019m in the car now with the dad. He says to me, \\u201cIs it okay if we stop somewhere because I need to pick something up?\\u201d He tells me where it is and I say, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s only five minutes from my house.\\u201d We pull up and it\\u2019s a really tall apartment building. There\\u2019s a circular approach to it and he pulls up the car to the front of the main door. Then he says, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize you can\\u2019t park here. If I stay in the car while it\\u2019s running, do you mind going up and getting the parcel?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d He describes to me the floor that it\\u2019s on and tells me that I have to go down to the end of the hallway and it\\u2019s the last door on the right. He says it should be open. I follow the instructions and end up where he tells me. The door is open. I go into the hallway and see a parcel there and it\\u2019s bright orange, the kind of orange you\\u2019d see on a construction site. I pick up the parcel and exit the door backwards. I leave my left arm in the doorway, so it doesn\\u2019t make a loud noise as it closes. I\\u2019m starting to feel strange about being in somebody\\u2019s apartment when I don't know them and picking something up when I don\\u2019t know what it is. I\\u2019m walking down the hallway feeling kind of edgy. I see two people coming towards me from the end of the hallway. I overhear snippets of their conversation and realize they live in the apartment I just exited. I take note of what they look like. It\\u2019s a man and a woman. The woman is wearing a long nice pretty dress. They are both brown skin. Her hair is dark and pulled back in a bun. As I start to go down the stairs I\\u2019m feeling really unsure about what I\\u2019ve just done. When I get to the car, I share this with the dad. Before he answers or addresses my concerns, I see on the front seat of the car a folded up front page of a newspaper. The picture on it is a picture of my face as I\\u2019m running away from a building and the headline is \\u201cThis Place Has Been Robbed!\\u201d Now I am really distressed. I\\u2019m asking him. He told me it was okay what\\u2019s going on here but while I\\u2019m talking, he starts driving quickly away. Out from the underground parking lot comes a great big bright yellow ocre Cadillac. It\\u2019s the kind of Cadillac really old people drive. It\\u2019s really long and wide and doesn\\u2019t fit in parking spots anymore. I can see through the front windshield, the same man and woman I met in the hallway. I can hear the sound of the engine of the car roaring to live. It\\u2019s driving really quickly. They\\u2019re tearing up the road behind us. The dad speeds up and says he thinks he can lose them. He drives through the downtown to the other side of the city where there is a suburban area. It\\u2019s a quieter place. You can feel the quiet. It\\u2019s dark, nighttime. We drive up a really steep hill and he tells me to get out here and I'll be safe. I don\\u2019t know where I am in regards to my own house. I know I don\\u2019t feel safe, yet he doesn\\u2019t even turn the car off and everything happens so quickly that I feel like I have to get out now and don\\u2019t have time to ask questions because the time we gained on the car chasing us might be lost. I feel threatened as if my life is at stake. On the way I told him I wanted to go to the police. I don\\u2019t remember if he replied. Everything was happening so quickly. I get out of the car. I don't have the package - it\\u2019s not mine and I didn\\u2019t want it. I go in between two buildings - it's a really narrow asphalt pathway. Once I get behind the buildings, I\\u2019m in a square courtyard with all these big houses backed onto it. I\\u2019m standing there in the dark. It\\u2019s a quiet cushy kind of feeling there. I think, \\u201cAlright, I gotta get my bearings. I don\\u2019t have anything with me. How can I get the police and explain what actually happened because I\\u2019m being wrongly accused of something I was tricked into doing. Where is a phone? It\\u2019s nighttime. I need somewhere to sleep but I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019ll be safe.\\u201d My eyes adjust to the dark and I see I\\u2019m at the top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill is the woman from the hallway and in the car. She looks at me and I can tell that she recognizes me. She looks like she\\u2019s getting ready to run up the hill. But I have momentum on my side, so I run down the hill faster and faster and faster. My idea is to tackle her, to take her out, and then keep running until no one can find me. But she guesses what I\\u2019m going to do and ducks under. I roll through the air and we both land on our feet. We\\u2019re squaring off at each other, circling around and around. This is where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Spare Room\\u201d This dream is situated in the house that I lied in with my daughter, only it\\u2019s empty and I\\u2019m the age I am now. I\\u2019m moving into it with two girlfriends that I currently work with at the yoga studio. It\\u2019s move-in day but we don\\u2019t have any furniture, so we\\u2019re doing a walk-through. We look through the main floor. It looks clean. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one for everyone. The bathroom looks like it\\u2019s in good shape. They stay up on the top floor. They\\u2019re looking around in the bedrooms for some specific measurements or something. I go down into the basement. Although the basement looks clean and dry, there\\u2019s something creepy in it; it\\u2019s an energy that I feel. I walk over to the sliding patio glass doors. I look behind the blinds. I see an old man there. He\\u2019s gardening. I ask him if he needs anything. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m good thanks.\\u201d He\\u2019s in the backyard on the other side of the glass and I\\u2019m on the inside. I look down to see what he\\u2019s doing. He has a toolbox and he\\u2019s fixing something. I ask him if he\\u2019s going to need to come into the house. He replies in a voice like, \\u201cOh no no, I would never go in there.\\u201d I think he knows something about this creepy energy in the basement. Then I go back upstairs to the main floor. The other two girls are starting to bring in boxes and furniture. I\\u2019m helping with that, bringing in my own stuff. We each set up our bedrooms then go downstairs. They\\u2019re having trouble arranging the furniture in the living room. A couple pieces are mine, a couple pieces belong to each one of them and we\\u2019re just trying to group them together. I look at what they have and say, \\u201cHmm, it\\u2019s funny that this won\\u2019t fit because when I used to live here, I had the same pieces of furniture and they all fit just fine.\\u201d So we keep rearranging and put the couch on another wall and arranging the other stuff around it. We try this on three different walls when I say, \\u201cWait a minute, I know why this isn\\u2019t fitting! That one wall that goes from the main hallway downstairs to the stairs that go up is shorter than it used to be! What\\u2019s going on with that?\\u201d So I open the door to the closet. Now there\\u2019s a closet on that same wall. For some reason we haven\\u2019t put anything in it, nor did we open it when we did our inspection. I open it up and it\\u2019s giant. Then I close it again and look on the outside of the wall and say, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s why nothing will fit there! Somebody has removed part of the wall in order to make this closet twice as large.\\u201d Then we open the closet door again and this time there is a single bed, a dresser, and a couple of low tables in there. There\\u2019s a light from the ceiling. I say, \\u201cI wonder if they had this set up as an Airbnb room?\\u201d One of the other girls says, \\u201cOr maybe they just needed an extra bedroom?\\u201d Then we close the closet door again. I notice that there is a clothing bar running down the length of the ceiling. I think I say out loud, \\u201cI wonder where we can put our coats?\\u201d Then between the three of us we decide that since we only each have one coat, we can find room for it in our own closets upstairs. Then I open the closet door one more time because I want to check the workmanship to see if this has been a hack job or if it will stay as another bedroom. I\\u2019m kind of entertaining the idea of an Airbnb room in mind. But this time when I open it up there\\u2019s a little tiny crib along with the single bed and dresser. I\\u2019m wondering what happened to this person or the baby. It kind of looks like they still live here. Then I\\u2019m starting to wonder if there\\u2019s a connection between that and the presence in the basement that I feel. I\\u2019m still thinking about this as I go back upstairs to unpack more things in the bedroom. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cRe-living the Move\\u201d I\\u2019m re-living what I\\u2019ve been doing this last week, which is helping my daughter move from a big house into a tiny apartment. I\\u2019m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m in the kitchen and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m up in the attic and there\\u2019s stuff there. There\\u2019s a whole other apartment\\u2019s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she\\u2019s ever had since she was a kid and it\\u2019s all just everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess and it\\u2019s not sorted. She hasn\\u2019t packed any of it into boxes and she\\u2019s asking me to help her, but she\\u2019s not ready. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I\\u2019m in the attic and my friend is there. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s helping, she\\u2019s just sitting there and she\\u2019s talking. Her mood is light and she\\u2019s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They\\u2019re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They\\u2019re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I\\u2019m reaching in and at first I\\u2019m pulling out things that are just garbage and I\\u2019m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn\\u2019t belong with the toys. My friend says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and she says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let\\u2019s do it!\\u201d She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn\\u2019t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don\\u2019t really want to do this because I won\\u2019t be present for what I\\u2019m packing. Then I realize that maybe that\\u2019s silly because I\\u2019m just packing and maybe I don\\u2019t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn\\u2019t really affect me. It actually tastes like water, so that\\u2019s kind of strange.\"],[\"\\u201cBraids\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large crowd of people. Somebody that I\\u2019m working for has instructed me to make sure that no one\\u2019s hair is in their eyes. I\\u2019ve got this kit that has different things that can be braided into people\\u2019s hair and fastened so the braids don\\u2019t come out. There are quite a few different pieces and lots of different colors, so that no matter what color anyone\\u2019s hair is or what color their skin is, the braids will look attractive and match their own personal style. When I first start doing this I\\u2019m using a chart because some people have been sick. I\\u2019m in a white sterile type of environment. I kind of move through there braiding the hair of those I kind. It\\u2019s one long white room packed with people shoulder to shoulder. It\\u2019s kind of hard to maneuver around and do what I\\u2019m supposed to do. As I complete this task, the room leads into another room that is dark with no lights on. So instead of being really bright and whiite, it\\u2019s dark but also more colorful. There\\u2019s a stage and people are performing some kind of music up on the stage. It\\u2019s an open mic night, so it could be anybody. There isn't a full band, just one person at a time performing. While this is going on, I\\u2019m on the lower level around whoever is watching and doing their hair. Then I complete the braids of the people I\\u2019m supposed to. The next person is a guy that\\u2019s just finishing performing. He\\u2019s sitting off to the side of the stage. More people are coming from the audience and sitting on the side so you can hardly see where the stage is. It\\u2019s also dark. I\\u2019m wondering what I\\u2019m going to do with his hair because he has a scarf around his head, his hair is inside of it and he\\u2019s wearing a hat on top of that. I tell him what I\\u2019m here to do and he says, \\u201cOkay. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to do with it though.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell what would you like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m pretty happy with it the way it is.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine. Do you want me to just put a couple of pieces around the temples?\\u201d He takes the hat off and removes the scarf. His hair is all in cornrows. One of them is binding all of them into one large ponytail. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019ve been instructed to do his hair, it\\u2019s perfectly fine the way it is. So I just try and wrap the scarf around his head the way it was and fasten it a little more sturdily. While I\\u2019m doing this, I see my ex-best friend. She\\u2019s taking the stage and jumping up and down and waving her arms around, but that\\u2019s all she\\u2019s doing. She\\u2019s not singing anything, she doesn\\u2019t have any talent, she\\u2019s just jumping up and down trying to get people to look at her. Then I see her family coming up to watch her, but the parents have had two more children. I think, \\u201cWow, the mom is over fifty. The youngest is probably going to be orphaned soon. I wonder how fair that is to have kids at that age?\\u201d When her family arrives, she stops jumping up and down and pretends to be limping as though she\\u2019s sick. Everyone is rushing over to her and saying, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\\u201d I feel like oh there she goes again doing her antics. I don\\u2019t go over and speak to them. I pick up the things I was using for the hair. I say goodbye and thank you to the guy who had basically undid his perfectly good hair and let me touch it and do something with it that wasn\\u2019t even useful and then he put it back together himself. I walk back through the crowd. Now I look down. I\\u2019m sure I was completely dressed when I started this, but now I\\u2019m wearing a tanktop that\\u2019s one of those old man\\u2019s undershirts. My own underwear is white and baggy like an old man\\u2019s. I feel exposed and naked. I\\u2019m not comfortable with this. I don\\u2019t even want anyone to see me. I\\u2019m trying to shoulder my way back through the crowd and stay in the dark. I go into the washroom which is part of another big room - it\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s bedroom. It\\u2019s a really messy bedroom with clothes all over the place. I\\u2019m hoping I can find something to put on.\"],[\"\\u201cDeja Vu\\u201d The dream starts where I\\u2019m having a dream that I\\u2019ve had before. I\\u2019m in a different country, I think the UK. I\\u2019m walking down a street. It\\u2019s raining lightly and it\\u2019s dark. There are street lamps that are gas powered - the old wrought iron kind about nine feet high. The streets are made of cobblestone and are a bit slick. I walk through the streets. There are some people around and they\\u2019re wearing overcoats and bonnets. The men are wearing hats with a brim in the front and back. The overcoats have a top layer that comes from the neck and goes over the shoulders to the waist. I walk for a while then I come to the place where I know I\\u2019m supposed to go. I open the front door and walk up the stairs to the second floor and knock on the door. My boyfriend from high school opens the door. Inside, he\\u2019s got art easels and papers and paints and everything strewn around. There are plates with unfinished food. His kids look like they\\u2019ve been there but they aren\\u2019t there right now. I clear a space for myself to sit down. He\\u2019s not really looking at me. He\\u2019s opened the door but he hasn\\u2019t stopped what he\\u2019s doing to ask me why I\\u2019m there or greet me. I know this is typical of him, this is how he works. So I just sit and look out the window until he\\u2019s finished with what he\\u2019s doing. It feels like it takes ten minutes. Then, I don\\u2019t even know what he says to me. There\\u2019s just a break in the focus. I ask him how he\\u2019s been. I know I\\u2019m there because there\\u2019s something wrong with him but he doesn\\u2019t know this yet. Rather than say anything, he gestures with his arm that he\\u2019s been doing all this. He leaves the room and goes to a corner with a pile of stuff. He comes back with something and he shows me sketches. They\\u2019re quite good. It seems like he\\u2019s been working on this project. He starts to get his coat on. I know we\\u2019re leaving out the door to go somewhere else. We go back out onto the street. We\\u2019re going in the opposite way that I came and we go in through another door. It\\u2019s crowded and I don\\u2019t know anyone here, but he does. I\\u2019m waiting for him to finish doing what he has to do here so that I can talk to him. While he\\u2019s talking to a group of people, I\\u2019m looking at some things on a table. There\\u2019s a deck of cards. I take the cards in my hand and shuffle them. Then I lay eight out on the table. I turn over the fourth one and it\\u2019s hand-drawn like a cartoon style. The card shows a group of people. I hold it up and see that one of them is my high school boyfriend. I look and it\\u2019s a card that shows him sitting in the booth where he\\u2019s sitting surrounded by the people that are there including the ones that have their backs to me and the ones that are silhouetted. I put that card back down on the table. Then I turn up another one. It\\u2019s his apartment when he was younger before his hair was grey. It\\u2019s drawn in cartoon style. The drawings are done in a black marker, so they\\u2019re black and white illustrations. This one shows him younger working on these projects. So now I don\\u2019t want to turn any more cards over until I've had a chance to talk to him. I keep the ones that are still in my hand in my hand. I\\u2019m just waiting for him to finish. I can hear the hum of voices but I\\u2019m not really listening or trying to pull any conversation out. I\\u2019m just waiting and kind of disengaged because I\\u2019m focused on something else. Time passes, maybe a half hour, and he\\u2019s finished. He comes over. I know we can leave now. I show him the first card I turned over where he is the age he is now. He looks at it and pauses. Then I say to him, \\u201cThese look like your drawings. Did you draw these cards? Did you illustrate them?\\u201d I know as soon as I say it that he did. He looks thoughtful. Then I gather up the cards and take them with us. We walk back to his apartment. I sit down again. He goes back to his easel, his drawing board, and begins to draw. I know I\\u2019ve seen this before and have been here many times. Then the dream flips a switch. I\\u2019m at some kind of get together or dance. I see his parents. His mom is all excited because he\\u2019s coming home. She asks me if I\\u2019ve seen him yet. I say, \\u201cNo I haven\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you should come by.\\u201d I think she gives me a date. She says, \\u201cCome by and have some snacks with us.\\u201d I tell her that I will. I do. His family is there. I spend some time talking with his sisters. It\\u2019s joyous. It feels like Christmas. I\\u2019m talking to one of his brothers. I know I should tell him something, but I don\\u2019t get the chance because there\\u2019s so much talking and too many people around. Then he\\u2019s gone and he\\u2019s gone back to the UK.\"],[\"\\u201cBoard Games and Cereal\\u201d I\\u2019m leaving my house with a board game. It\\u2019s resting against my hip and I\\u2019ve got my left hand around the box to keep it closed. I\\u2019m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It\\u2019s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn\\u2019t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven\\u2019t fallen out. It\\u2019s old and the box doesn\\u2019t hold it\\u2019s shape very well because it\\u2019s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I\\u2019m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There\\u2019s somebody else but I can\\u2019t remember who it is now. We don\\u2019t have any front steps and it\\u2019s like a ramp. It actually feels like I\\u2019ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a long line of stores. We\\u2019re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there\\u2019s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there\\u2019s somebody else I know. They\\u2019re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don\\u2019t have masks on either. I note this and say, \\u201cWell, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!\\u201d We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I\\u2019m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, \\u201cThe cash register is over there and you have to line up.\\u201d Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they\\u2019re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They\\u2019re giving me cash. It\\u2019s not debit. I\\u2019m questioning this. The store owner comes back having finished organizing what she wanted to organize. She says, \\u201cThank you so much, I can take it from here.\\u201d I pick up my board game again. I see Julie, who I used to work with at the restaurant. I realize I\\u2019m wearing a hat, glasses and a mask and she\\u2019s probably not going to recognize me. She\\u2019s talking to somebody else I know who calls me over into the conversation. I say, \\u201cDo you know who I am?\\u201d She\\u2019s looking like she might. I take my hat off first and then I just take one of the loops of the mask from my ear quickly. She says my name and I put the mask and hat back on. She gives me a big hug and says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen you in so long.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019ve aged. You look fantastic.\\u201d I wait. She tells me about her life. This goes on for a little bit. I wonder if she\\u2019s going to tell me about her three boys. She tells me she\\u2019s in a new relationship. We say goodbye and she leaves. I notice that a piece from the board game, a house, is moving. It\\u2019s escaped from the box and is flying around. I shout this: \\u201cOh no! The house piece is on the move!\\u201d My kids are trying to catch it. They crawl underneath a cart that shopkeepers put out on the sidewalk for the day - it has legs and a bin and is made of wire. They\\u2019re crawling under these and one of them catches the piece and puts it back in the box. I\\u2019m feeling like we\\u2019ve been gone from the house too long. We turn around and start to make our way back home. I see somebody else on the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a stand up display that a man is hiding behind. He\\u2019s peeking to the person standing on the sidewalk. The person on the sidewalk is describing to us a little fearfully that somebody is spying on them. I don\\u2019t understand why they\\u2019re scared because it\\u2019s just somebody looking at them through a natural gap between the displays. I approach the guy that\\u2019s been accused of spying and say, \\u201cHey, how are you?\\u201d He says he\\u2019s good and he says, \\u201cLook. I can see the entire street through this little tiny gap.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s amazing.\\u201d He\\u2019s got pajamas over his clothes, but just the legs of pajamas. He\\u2019s wearing them like chaps, only they don\\u2019t have a belt. I say, \\u201cThis is interesting, what you have on your legs. May I ask what the purpose of it is?\\u201d He tells me it\\u2019s just a creative idea he had for dressing and he just likes it that way. It\\u2019s not for protection or anything like that. I say, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s very interesting.\\u201d Now the other person who was freaking out and accusing him of spying has been deflated and has stopped having a fit about it. The person that was accused, he was walking around and describing how he made these pajama bottom legs. He\\u2019s not peeking through the thing anymore. I guess that\\u2019s why the other person is okay now. Pajama-bottoms guy walks the opposite way and the other person continues across the street. Then I notice that the pieces of the board game are moving, they\\u2019re vibrating a lot. I\\u2019m saying to my kids, \\u201cWe really have to get home now or we\\u2019re going to lose control of these things and they\\u2019re going to fly out all over the place.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying that, the house piece flies out again. It goes way underneath this great big long outdoor bin of a different store. It goes far enough underneath that there are cobwebs. I\\u2019m not fantastically excited about chasing it under here but I do because the game is useless without that piece. I saw it go under there but it\\u2019s really dark. I feel around with my hand and there\\u2019s only one thing that\\u2019s not first so I grab it. It doesn\\u2019t look like the house piece anymore - it\\u2019s flat and not moving. I go back under there again to check around for anything else and there\\u2019s not. I put the piece in the box and am feeling like it\\u2019s not the piece. I\\u2019m already wondering where we\\u2019re going to get another one of those pieces. I know that we can\\u2019t. We continue on towards the house. There\\u2019s a guy I dated for a little while lingering around the outside. He\\u2019s trying to engage with my family. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t talk to him. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near us.\\u201d I don\\u2019t speak to him. He\\u2019s acting like I did. He\\u2019s smiling and being oblivious. He\\u2019s walking with my family. I\\u2019m getting really annoyed because he\\u2019s dense and acting like someone welcomed him in when nobody did. He follows us up the ramp and now he\\u2019s in the house. I\\u2019m ignoring him. He\\u2019s at my back. I set the board game down on the table. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says, \\u201cHere, if you put this on, it will take away all the pain from your neck, shoulders and back.\\u201d I look down and at first it looks like the thing a catcher wears in a baseball game. It\\u2019s made of this dark blue rough cotton stuff, like something a priestess would wear. It\\u2019s over my clothes. He\\u2019s pulling the drawstrings at the back tightly - they\\u2019re laces - the way someone would lace up the back of a corset. It\\u2019s very constricting and makes my arms stick out awkwardly by my side. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t want this. Can you please just get out of the house? You don\\u2019t live here. This is not your place.\\u201d He lies down on the couch and goes to sleep. I\\u2019m poking at him and he won\\u2019t move. I don\\u2019t know how to deal with this. I\\u2019m looking for my daughter to ask her if she can take these laces off and get me out of this thing. I go upstairs and there\\u2019s been a whole pile of people up there with a whole bunch of kids. They\\u2019ve gotten into everything. They\\u2019ve pulled it all out. I get the vacuum out and start vacuuming things up. You know when there\\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff in the rug and you can hear it clicking as it goes up the vacuum tube? I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019ll have to clean all this up with my hands. I start doing this. I realize there\\u2019s more furniture than will fit in the rooms and there\\u2019s stuff all over the floor. I\\u2019m trying to sort it out and figure out what goes in what room and what we really need. We need something to put towels in and there\\u2019s nothing in the bathroom and no cabinet. Where are we going to put all the towels? I go into my room. There\\u2019s stuff all over the floor! There\\u2019s this three year old kid and I don\\u2019t know who she belongs to. She\\u2019s dumped everything out onto the carpet. I pick it up and put it in bags. I think I\\u2019ve got as much as i can with my hands and start to run the vacuum. When I lift up the bedskirt to vacuum under the bed, the vacuum won\\u2019t go any further. I bend down and look. There are bags of oatmeal cereal that have been poured out and dumped. The oatmeal is eight inches thick. It\\u2019s all underneath the bed. My daughter comes in and knows I\\u2019m upset. She says, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cCan you please just keep picking this stuff up off the floor? Look, the vacuum isn\\u2019t even getting it all out.\\u201d Somebody has taken this black soil from a plant and it\\u2019s slightly wet so even when the vacuum goes over, it leaves a black stain everywhere. I\\u2019m overwhelmed with all the stuff that isn\\u2019t useful and is not in place and the people who aren\\u2019t listening to me and are in my house.\"],[\"\\u201cMaps\\u201d I\\u2019m driving around Toronto and I have to be somewhere at a certain time so that my son can attend the school. I have someone in the seat beside me, I think it might be my cycling friend. He\\u2019s fiddling with my radio and I\\u2019ve asked him not to because it\\u2019s connected to some kind of complex GPS in the middle of my steering wheel. If the radio stays on one station, then I\\u2019ve got wireless for my GPS. I've never been to this school before so I need to use the GPS, but normally I don\\u2019t use it to drive around Toronto because I know my way. So my son is in the backseat with his friend and they\\u2019re both going to this school, I think. My friend keeps fiddling with the radio and I keep saying, \\u201cWill you please stop doing that? I need it because I\\u2019m going to have to turn the GPS on in a moment.\\u201d It\\u2019s time to leave and drive my son to school. But he continues to fiddle with it and I\\u2019m getting a little annoyed with him. He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, you\\u2019ll be able to find the statio afterwards.\\u201d I press the buttons on the steering wheel because we\\u2019re now all in the car. Of course it\\u2019s dark and I can\\u2019t see very well. The traffic is crazy in Toronto. People get annoyed if you\\u2019re not driving quickly enough and the lanes are too narrow and there are too many cars. I put the coordinates in and see the lights flicker. The map comes to life and pinpoints where we are and where the school is. It\\u2019s on satellite view and I want to zoom in so I can see the street names so I have advanced warning for when I have to turn right or left because the traffic is so crazy here. That\\u2019s why I need the radio station to be on a certain channel. With my right hand, I'm turning it back to the channel I had it on and of course it\\u2019s static. I look over at my friend and say, \\u201cYou did mess it up. I need you to fix it and I need you to do it right away because I have to turn soon and I don\\u2019t know what street to turn on.\\u201d He fiddles around with it and puts it back on the station it\\u2019s supposed to be. I zoom in on the map on my steering wheel and see the names of the streets. Now I\\u2019m just driving there. The map has told me to go further. I\\u2019m at a traffic light and see ahead of me the highway which will take me out of town. Luckily there\\u2019s no one behind me or beside me because I have to pull a U-turn. I see the school and it\\u2019s not what the map said to do, but there it is. So I pull a U-turn, pull my car over where I\\u2019m not supposed to park and where nobody\\u2019s supposed to be. I tell the boys to get out, \\u201cQuickly just go run into your class!\\u201d It's portable and camouflaged so you can\\u2019t even tell it\\u2019s there. They get out. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll go park the car and I\\u2019ll be back in with your school bag. I\\u2019ll find you, don\\u2019t worry. Just get to your class on time.\\u201d They do. I find someplace to park the car. There\\u2019s a great big bin with hundreds of school bags in it. I don\\u2019t know which one is my son\\u2019s. I walk across the street, go up a couple of blocks, go to the portable and tell the teacher, \\u201cSorry, I don\\u2019t mean to bother you, but we had trouble getting here and I need to give my son his school bag.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, that's fine.\\u201d He\\u2019s writing a test. I sneak quietly between the rows of desks and they\\u2019re packed in really tight. I whisper to my son, \\u201cWhat is it that you need?\\u201d He tells me what it is - a pile of white papers. I wonder how I\\u2019m supposed to find it with that description. I turn around, go back out and go up the two blocks. I open the backseat of my car. I\\u2019m not sure if what I\\u2019m getting is correct. I gather it up and it\\u2019s not papers at all, they\\u2019re clips. They\\u2019re like the wire clips you put inside curtains to gather pieces together and hook them to a curtain rod - like you put eight or ten together on a long piece of fabric that has the holes in already. There are three prongs on the end of each curtain hook and you have to insert the curtain fabric up inside the prongs and it makes the curtain look like there are pleats in it. So there are twelve of these. I can barely hold them together in my hands. When I pick them up, one falls down and rolls underneath all the long lines of cars. I hear it stop and know it\\u2019s under a car, but it\\u2019s dark and I can\\u2019t see it. I spend some time looking for it, crawling under the cars in the mud. I still can\\u2019t find it. I need to get back and I\\u2019m not going to arrive in time, he\\u2019ll be finished. So I\\u2019m carrying these down the block and back to the school. As I\\u2019m doing this, the other kid who is his friend passes by me. He says my son needs me to get something, a pink binder. He\\u2019s very specific as he\\u2019s describing it. I think, \\u201cOh,that\\u2019s what he needs!\\u201d I go in anyway and tell the teacher that we have these clips that we thought we were supposed to prepare and my son has gathered them. I set them down. She\\u2019s sitting at a picnic table outside the portable, waiting for the kids to finish. As I\\u2019m setting them down, another one rolls in the grass and I hear it land. She saw it too. She looks around a little bit, too. I\\u2019m realizing that I did go back to the car and looked inside the bin and found the pink binder that the friend described. I took it back and gave it to my son. Now I\\u2019m sitting at the picnic table with the teacher. She says, \\u201cI need to talk to you about your son. He\\u2019s been getting really good marks but I\\u2019m not sure if he\\u2019s earned them.\\u201d I tell her that we just need to get him through high school and I realize some of the marks haven\\u2019t been earned but he tests brilliantly in his mind but he has a gap between getting the things from his mind onto a piece of paper. He\\u2019s entirely the kind of kid who needs to go to university where his mind is stimulated by something he wants to do. I say, \\u201cHe tests as though he can be a counselor or psychiatrist or something along that line where he\\u2019s working with people. He needs to finish high school to get there, so that\\u2019s why I haven\\u2019t said anything about some of the marks.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s the teachers that are giving him higher marks than he should be getting.\\u201d I shrug my shoulders because I\\u2019m not going to dispute that and I'm also not going to take it to task.\"],[\"\\u201cCottage in Mexico\\u201d This dream begins in the car. I\\u2019m driving with my younger brother. We\\u2019ve driven a long way and that part isn\\u2019t in the dream. I didn\\u2019t know where we were going, but it didn\\u2019t matter, it was a family road trip. I\\u2019m always only there just for the family time. I do get the sense there is wide open blue sky and red dirt. We come to a place where we stop. My brother lets me know that now we are going somewhere else, we\\u2019re not just driving around, we have a destination. We drive through a really dilapidated town. The sky has a certain color because it is reflecting a large body of water. It looks like water is not that far away. My brother drives the car through an area with houses. He says, \\u201cWe bought a cottage.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at a ten by ten shack. The bottom part doesn\\u2019t even have wood. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cReally, you bought that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Turn around behind you.\\u201d I see a much larger building. It\\u2019s also not in very good condition, but it\\u2019s livable. There\\u2019s a great big backyard. We pull the car then my parents pull up - they\\u2019ve been driving towards the same destination - and then my other brother pulls up in his car. So we have three cars. My other brother has the trailer attached to his. We go in the house. We start opening windows, turning lights on, bringing some things from the cars - suitcases and stuff, but no furniture. The cottage is already furnished. There are three floors. The upstairs is a sleeping floor. The main floor is the kitchen and a living area. The bottom floor is one big long room with twenty tables with chairs around them. I realize as I\\u2019ve gone through all the floors that it has been set up as a retreat area. I ask my sister-in-law, \\u201cAre you guys going to start having retreats?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to set it up as a single family dwelling.\\u201d Then we start sweeping. We\\u2019re sweeping out the main floor first and getting the kitchen ready. My stepmom is doing some dishes because there\\u2019s dust on everything. We\\u2019re taking stock of what\\u2019s there. There\\u2019s enough that they don\\u2019t need to bring any of their own stuff. At this point, my young nephew, he\\u2019s only one, starts to get tired. My sister-in-law says we should go upstairs and sort out the sleeping arrangements. I follow her up. The bedrooms upstairs are small. We\\u2019re counting them and trying to see who\\u2019s going to sleep where. When we\\u2019re in one of the bedrooms, I look out the top window to see an amazing view of the ocean. I\\u2019m standing there looking at it for a little bit. My nephew crawls over and I can feel him tugging on my leg and he\\u2019s standing. I pick him up and we\\u2019re both looking out the window at the water. My sister-in-law comes over and says she has a bath ready for him. She takes him. I find some sheets.i\\u2019m starting to put them on all the beds. I finish that. I can still hear my nephew and sister-in-law in the bathroom. I go downstairs and my brother is in the kitchen. I ask him, \\u201cAre you guys moving here? This is a long way to go.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve been working from home for a while, so I\\u2019m thinking we can stay down here for up to six months and then we\\u2019ll go back home.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a good arrangement. He says, \\u201cYeah, except I\\u2019m broke now.\\u201d I wonder why he bought this. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did you buy this so you can flip it?\\u201d He\\u2018s really handy. He says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to keep it. My contract is almost due anyway.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking this doesn\\u2019t really add up. I say, \\u201cWell, I'm really going to miss you living down here. Although I've been waiting myself to be able to get a cottage in Ireland or Scotland area, I just love it over there. I can just get something small. But it\\u2019s hard to do those things by yourself, especially if it needs work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I get that.\\u201d Then I go down to the main floor. My sister-in-law is there by herself so I\\u2019m assuming she\\u2019s put my nephew to bed. She opens up one of the cupboards and pulls something out. It looks like a long braid of sweetgrass. It\\u2019s long enough that she\\u2019s holding it in both of her hands. It looks like it\\u2019s been wrapped in parchment paper and it\\u2019s really dry, you can see little bits of it have crumbled off. I ask her what she\\u2019s going to do with it. She says, \\u201cWell, I think I\\u2019ll just burn it and see what it smells like.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking through other drawers for a lighter. I turn around and she\\u2019s found something to light it with. The smell is drifting over to me and I say to her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sweet grass. That smells like marijauna.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh!\\u201d But she continues to smell it. Then I see that my nephew is not in bed, he\\u2019s playing on the floor in the other room. I tell her we need to take this upstairs and open all the windows so the smell doesn\\u2019t affect him. She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She starts following me but she\\u2019s having to walk really slowly because the paper is really flimsy and the stuff is so dry that if you walk fast, it will fly out and get all over the floor which is also dangerous. She\\u2019s walking so slowly that the smoke is filling up the room. I\\u2019m looking around. Now I notice that the kitchen doesn\\u2019t have any windows. We are on the stairs now and I\\u2019m standing behind her to hide her from the others. We get to the next floor and into the closest bedroom. We open the bedroom door and then I say to her, \\u201cWell what are we going to do with it now? There\\u2019s nowhere to set it. Maybe we should just put it out in water.\\u201d She\\u2019s trying to use the parchment paper to pinch the burning parts and put the fire out. She says, \\u201cI think I want to save this.\\u201d I laugh and say, \\u201cI know for those times when somebody else is sleeping.\\u201d We both laugh and I say, \\u201cYeah, there\\u2019s too much of this to throw out.\\u201d Then we both start pinching it to try and put it out. We finish doing that then we wrap it up like a tube and twist the ends - it\\u2019s like a giant long skinny candy. I hear some voices downstairs. We just leave it. We close the bedroom door and go back downstairs to the kitchen. There are two Mexican men and one of them has some paper money in his hand. He\\u2019s talking to my brother. They\\u2019re asking if they can buy the furniture that\\u2019s in the recreation room downstairs. He\\u2019s agreeing to do it. The guy is telling him that he\\u2019s offering him 50 Canadian dollars for each setting. I\\u2019m close enough to see that it\\u2019s not dollars but pesos, but he\\u2019s said it in Spanish and he said \\u201cdolares.\\u201d So when my brother goes down to start counting all the chairs and tables to do the math I run after him to try and talk to him without the other guys hearing me. I say, \\u201cThose aren\\u2019t dollars, they\\u2019re pesos. So he\\u2019s giving you fifty pesos which is way way way less than the dolares.\\u201d My brother is listening to me and we do a calculation and he goes back to haggle with them. I\\u2019m trusting that he now knows the information and will make a fair deal. Now we\\u2019re going around the tables and my stepmother is in the room, too. It\\u2019s dark. We haven\\u2019t figured out where the lights are. The tables are all identical, but the chairs are all different. There are more chairs than tables. I see that there are two press-backed rocking chairs randomly placed at the tables. These rocking chairs are exceedingly more valuable than the other ones. I\\u2019m trying to pull those out. There\\u2019s another chair that is quite intricate and I\\u2019ve put the three of them against the wall. I\\u2019ve set the other identical chairs around the table so they get sold. My stepmom sees what I\\u2019m doing and she\\u2019s also organizing the chairs so that the ones that get sold are the ones of lesser value and also fit with the tables. The men take them out to their truck and disappear. It\\u2019s like a ballroom now. It has a completely different feel with those business tables and chairs gone and just those two rocking chairs and the intricate chair. My stepmom and I place them together in the middle of the room. I\\u2019m thinking it would be nice to have a fireplace here. We leave the basement and go back up. My brother is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWow, I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll ever see you guys again.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, return tickets are $893. That\\u2019s not bad. You can visit and stay as long as you want. All you have to pay for is your flight.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYeah, but I\\u2019d need to bring both of my kids, too, and $893 times three is like $2,900 or something.\\u201d I feel really sad because I don\\u2019t think I can afford to go down and see him when he\\u2019s there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sound\\u201d I\\u2019m on my way or coming from somewhere. I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven\\u2019t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We\\u2019re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It\\u2019s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can\\u2019t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they\\u2019re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it\\u2019s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they\\u2019re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn\\u2019t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, \\u201cYes, I know. I don\\u2019t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, are you coming for Trina\\u2019s fiftieth birthday?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t know about that, but maybe.\\u201d She writes the date down and tells me it\\u2019s going to be on April first. When she\\u2019s writing this down I say, \\u201cYou know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn\\u2019t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll put my phone number down here, too.\\u201d She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have yours either.\\u201d She gives me another piece of paper, it\\u2019s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I\\u2019m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it\\u2019s so small that there isn\\u2019t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, \\u201cHmm, there\\u2019s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d While she\\u2019s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I\\u2019m doing this, she says to me, \\u201cHave you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they\\u2019re trying to change things in this town.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow they must really have their work cut out for them because there\\u2019s so much dark horribleness in this place.\\u201d She\\u2019s telling me that there\\u2019s a movement against them coming in. I just say, \\u201cNo, I didn\\u2019t know about either one.\\u201d Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I\\u2019m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I\\u2019m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I\\u2019ve asked her for a drink of water which I\\u2019ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it\\u2019s windy and they\\u2019re blowing open. So I\\u2019m trying to pee as I\\u2019m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it\\u2019s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, \\u201cCome back anytime.\\u201d I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there\\u2019s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way. I just press his phone number to see if he\\u2019s home because I don\\u2019t want to go out there if he isn\\u2019t. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Baby\\u201d I\\u2019m in an arena, the kind where people have hockey games and figure skating competitions. I\\u2019m carrying a baby, maybe about 4-6 months old. I\\u2019m walking around the arena. I see one of the managers from the restaurant where I used to work, Blake. I don\\u2019t approach him yet. I go into one of the change rooms. Nobody is in it. I see one of those dropdown beds that you push into the wall. I drop it down and I lie down on it with my baby and I begin to nurse her. I finish that. She\\u2019s happy and fed. I put her in a sling attached to my body and open the arena door and go out onto the ice. I\\u2019m skating. I skate around and around and around. I\\u2019m enjoying myself. The baby is liking this, too - I can see her smiling face inside her hat and she\\u2019s laughing. A good deal of time passes and I think that\\u2019s enough. We go back and I open the heavy arena door, it\\u2019s kind of hard with a baby in a sling in front of my body. I step down a step and go back to the change room. I stop because Blake comes in the door and tells me that I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that in the arena without something from the drug store, I can\\u2019t remember what. I say, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize that.\\u201d So, I put my coat back on and the baby is still in the sling. We walk out of the arena, down the long ramp, down a few blocks to the drug store. I\\u2019m in the drug store and looking at all these baby products. I think I don\\u2019t need any of these things. I leave the store and go back to the arena. As soon as I arrive, Blake comes back out again and he\\u2019s questioning me. I am trying to tell him that I know what I\\u2019m doing, but he\\u2019s agitated. He follows me into the change room. I want to lie down again and nurse my baby. He\\u2019s telling me I\\u2019m doing a whole bunch of things wrong. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s four pillows on the bed, it will be fine.\\u201d He leaves but he\\u2019s exasperated with me. I nurse my baby again and then she\\u2019s tired so I let her rest. I pile the pillows up around her. Because Blake has made me question myself, I stand there for a moment and think, \\u201cIs there any way that she would be ready to start crawling and get out of these pillows?\\u201d I\\u2019m positive that she\\u2019s not ready. I leave the change room and go out into the arena foyer. Now there\\u2019s a big lineup and it\\u2019s no longer an arena. At the end of the ramp where the door opens is a pier where a ferry backs in so people can drive onto it and go across the lake. While I\\u2019m standing there, I see one of my son\\u2019s friends and his mom and they\\u2019re waiting in the lineup. There are two different lineups about two feet apart. I\\u2019m standing between them. They both have a different agenda. The mom is going one place and her son is going another place. They\\u2019re arguing because the mom is saying one thing but her son is contradicting her saying, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it says in the Bible.\\u201d I wonder when he started being interested in that because he certainly wasn\\u2019t all the years he was friends with my son. I think he deserves to be listened to. I ask him a couple questions about why he\\u2019s making that statement and why he has to go this way. He explains it to me. I think that makes sense and I guess really the only way to find out is if you actually get on the ferry and go to the destination and see if all those white rocks are actually there. I wish him good luck or the best or safe journey or something. I turn to the mom and say, \\u201cI think he\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t talk to me, she just keeps looking straight ahead and she had the whole time she was standing there. I turn around and walk back through the lineups and up the ramp, back to the arena and into the change room where my baby is still sleeping. I decide that I\\u2019m tired and I lay down beside her, put my head on the pillow and go to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cCourt Date\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house I used to live in and it was the top floor of a bungalow and in the basement was a doctor\\u2019s office. I\\u2019m in the back bedroom. I\\u2019m sitting on my bed and I have a laptop in front of me. I\\u2019m also curling my hair, which is extremely strange because I have naturally curly hair and I\\u2019ve never used a curling iron in my life. I take a piece of my hair and I put it between the mouth of the curling iron and I pull the curling iron all the way to the end the way I\\u2019ve seen other people do, which actually straightens my hair, then I wrap the curling iron around my hair and I hold it and then I unwrap it. Instead of my hair being curly, it\\u2019s straight. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m doing this and don\\u2019t understand why I would do this. I have this dream consciousness that is confused and then there\\u2019s another consciousness that is also saying, \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t even work! It doesn\\u2019t even curl my hair the way it\\u2019s supposed to!\\u201d My son is only about eight years old in the dream and he\\u2019s occupying the other back bedroom. I know he\\u2019s there because I can hear him moving around. Since I hear him moving around, I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts on the two documents I\\u2019m writing on my laptop so I don\\u2019t lose my train of thought because I\\u2019m going to do a board game with him or something. I want to see what he wants to do now that he\\u2019s awake. It\\u2019s morning. I have been up for quite a while. He has just woken up and I can hear this because there\\u2019s movement. I look on the laptop and I\\u2019ve got one document open where I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts and focus for an upcoming court case with my son\\u2019s father. The other one is something that I\\u2019m writing as a creative project that I\\u2019m not sure is for school or just enjoyment. I click into the court case one because that one\\u2019s more important and has a date coming up soon. I\\u2019m trying to sort out the threads in my head of how the court date arose, what the reason is for it. It\\u2019s really hard to sort out because I don\\u2019t want to make it into an attack on my son\\u2019s dad\\u2019s character, yet every reason I would put in there that I would say anything about is also going to be something to do with his character. I think this is why it\\u2019s so hard to write. If it wasn\\u2019t for his character, there wouldn\\u2019t be a court case. But he continues to lie and doesn\\u2019t follow through on any of the custody conditions. He just doesn\\u2019t do them then lies and says he was. So I typed five words out then keep deleting them. I close the laptop and get up to leave the room, but the door opens and my son is standing there. I ask him what he would like to do today. He says that he wants to go out to someplace. I get up and we go out into the kitchen to have breakfast first, but his dad is standing there. I\\u2019m confused as to how he got in the house. He\\u2019s in the kitchen and he\\u2019s making a piece of toast or sandwich or something and is carrying it out into the living room. He lies down on the couch and puts the sandwich on his chest and turns the tv on. I feel that this is somehow a violation of not only the custody arrangement but of my own personal space. Then my son goes into the living room and is watching the television, only it\\u2019s guys out on the town and it's really inappropriate for an eight year old boy to be watching. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat kind of arrangement is this?\\u201d I could have sworn he had his own place. I\\u2019m standing there in the kitchen trying to sort that out in my head. I\\u2019m wondering why I don\\u2019t remember this. Then I think of twelve other times recently where he\\u2019s been in the house and I start to doubt myself and think maybe I don\\u2019t have my own space and maybe he does live here and maybe this is what the court case is about because we still have to have personal time with our son. But since he\\u2019s making the sandwich and turning the tv on, it\\u2019s eroding my son\\u2019s attention and he\\u2019s just going over to the tv and now I\\u2019m not getting my own time with my son because of what his dad is doing. I walk back down the hall to the bedroom. I go back to the laptop because I think maybe there\\u2019s a document to help me remember whose day this is supposed to be and what the arrangements are because I didn\\u2019t think he was living with us. As I\\u2019m looking for that, my son comes into the bedroom. I say, \\u201cOh good, you\\u2019re back.\\u201d I close the laptop and think maybe I don\\u2019t have to sort this out. I say, \\u201cWould you like to play a boardgame?\\u201d He says yes. I say, \\u201cGood.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ve got this pinball machine in the closet that would be really interesting to play plus it would be good for his hand eye coordination and I like that it\\u2019s not television, it\\u2019s the opposite, it\\u2019s something you kind of do with your body. I say to him, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just play this for a few minutes. Then we can go out for a walk because it\\u2019s snowing out and it\\u2019s really pretty.\\u201d He says that he would like to do that. I show him how to pull the big plunger back, then watch it hit the ball, then the ball goes up and hits the other lights. I say, \\u201cThen you have to move this way, then you have to move that way because you want the ball to hit the paddle, then you use the flippers to hit it. We\\u2019re trying to get it to go into this part of the tube.\\u201d He does and he tries but he doesn\\u2019t pull the plunger back far enough and he gets discouraged. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay, here try it again, it\\u2019s alright.\\u201d But he only pulls it three times and gets discouraged again and wants to go out and lie on the couch with his dad and watch tv. I feel really defeated by this because that\\u2019s all his dad does. I tell him, \\u201cWell, your dad\\u2019s not supposed to pick you up at four, so let\\u2019s go for a walk, let\\u2019s go outside and walk through the snowflakes.\\u201d But then his dad comes down to the room and opens the bedroom door and bends down and picks him up and takes him back into the living room. Now I feel really resigned. I sit back on the bed, open up the laptop, and from my own memory, I\\u2019m typing out what I remember the custody arrangement to be. Every time I type a sentence, the computer erases it. There\\u2019s something wrong with the computer. Then I think that maybe if I record my voice and do text to talk, that will work, then I\\u2019ll just fix the typos that those things always make after. I'm trying to do that. Then I hear my ex going out the door. I hear the front door shut. I look out and he\\u2019s taken my son and gone. So I go out the front door and think that at least I can go for a walk now. I go out onto the back porch. It\\u2019s a beautiful sunny day. My phone rings. It\\u2019s my friend who lives in Holland now and I haven\\u2019t talked to in years. I tell her, \\u201cOh, hi!\\u201d I\\u2019m excited to hear from her. I notice she has a Dutch accent now and she didn\\u2019t when she lived in Canada and I think that\\u2019s from being in Holland for so long. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m just about to go for a walk, but I\\u2019d really love to talk to you. Can I call you back later?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell I only have time to talk right now.\\u201d I notice as I\\u2019m talking to her that my son is on the stairs at the bottom of the deck. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing there because he was supposed to be with his dad. I tell my friend, \\u201cI actually can\\u2019t talk to you right now because my son is here.\\u201d She sounds really disappointed, but I promise to call her back. I hang the phone up then these two men come walking up the back porch and I realize that they\\u2019re for the doctor who lives in the basement because this happens all the time between the hours of 8-4. It\\u2019s a man and his twelve to fourteen year old son. They\\u2019re walking together and the dad\\u2019s taking him to the doctor\\u2019s office. They\\u2019re about to go in when the man looks at me and says, \\u201cBathe me.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019m not going to do that!\\u201d He pulls up a chair and another for his son. His son sits in one of the chairs. He sits in the chair and crosses his ankle over his thigh and sits back a little bit, then he crosses his hands over his chest. Then he looks at me and says, \\u201cIf you come here I\\u2019ll tell you why that\\u2019s funny.\\u201d His son has a smirk on his face and so does the dad. I think he\\u2019s genuinely trying to tell me a joke. He looks completely harmless and his body movements are such that he\\u2019s still trying to keep the time for his appointment. I think, \\u201cShould I let him just tell his joke?\\u201d I start to walk over in front of him so he can give me the punch line, then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Songwriter\\u201d I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It\\u2019s like a small theatre, so it\\u2019s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they\\u2019re hosting a band. I don\\u2019t sit at one of the seats though, I\\u2019m standing at the back. I\\u2019m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I\\u2019m listening to the lyrics because I\\u2019m familiar with them. I\\u2019m really just wanting to enjoy how they\\u2019re paired with the melody. We\\u2019re about four songs in. He sings this one and it\\u2019s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I\\u2019m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn\\u2019t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight\\u2019s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I\\u2019m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he\\u2019s finished and, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to tell you about that song.\\u201d I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It\\u2019s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It\\u2019s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, \\u201cOh, where did this come from?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI found it in your friend\\u2019s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he\\u2019s dead.\\u201d It\\u2019s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn\\u2019t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn\\u2019t really grieved his friend\\u2019s death. That\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It\\u2019s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, \\u201cNo way, he wouldn\\u2019t have written this for me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.\\u201d I can see it\\u2019s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I\\u2019m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It\\u2019s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d How could there be any other result here other than he\\u2019s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?\\u201d He\\u2019s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he\\u2019s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, \\u201cThank you for showing me this.\\u201d We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Protective Glasses\\u201d I go back to the same theatre. This time I\\u2019m with my daughter. We\\u2019re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I\\u2019m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There\\u2019s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There\\u2019s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they\\u2019re closing them and stuff, but we\\u2019re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we\\u2019re standing there and we\\u2019re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don\\u2019t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: \\u201cWhat are those glasses you\\u2019re wearing? Are they protective somehow?\\u201d She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHmm, wow, maybe they do work,\\u201d kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there\\u2019s an indoor pool. It\\u2019s the same thing where we\\u2019re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you\\u2019re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it\\u2019s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they\\u2019re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don\\u2019t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can\\u2019t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher\\u2019s attention and say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s in there, she\\u2019s in the pool.\\u201d I go back outside so I\\u2019m behind the glass and I\\u2019m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I\\u2019m scanning the water, there\\u2019s no daughter. I\\u2019m starting to get scared and thinking, \\u201cAre they so busy testing everyone that they\\u2019re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?\\u201d I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to be in here! You can\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for my daughter! She\\u2019s underneath the water. She\\u2019s not surfacing.\\u201d They look and she\\u2019s not in there. Now I\\u2019m really scared, like, \\u201cWhat the heck? Where is she?\\u201d The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She\\u2019s definitely not in the pool. We\\u2019re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I\\u2019m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She\\u2019s coming from the back of the pool. They\\u2019re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?\\u201d She says, \\u201c Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.\\u201d I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I\\u2019m upset with her.\"],[\"\\u201cWheat\\u201d I\\u2019m eating supper with my friend who is a dietician and her family. She has four kids and her husband is there, too. She\\u2019s describing to me the benefits of a plant based diet and invites me to stay for supper. I agree because I think it\\u2019s going to be all plant based food, but instead, she dishes out pasta like spaghetti that already has tomato sauce mixed in with it, and starts putting it on everybody\\u2019s plates. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you, I can\\u2019t eat wheat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, hmm, that\\u2019s all we have.\\u201d I say,\\u201dThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m used to not eating anything as opposed to eating wheat and suffering through the effects of it for weeks to come.\\u201d When her family is finished eating I notice that hardly any of her kids ate all the pasta. She just scrapes it all into the garbage. I wonder why she\\u2019s feeding her family stuff like this when she\\u2019s been advocating this plant based diet and also creating such waste. I find this puzzling.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Stairs\\u201d I\\u2019m in kind of like an office building, that\\u2019s what it feels like. Everything is that institutional color, white or grey. There are a lot of windows but no design or creativity to the architecture, it\\u2019s just put together. The dream begins on the bottom floor. There is one couch and a whole bunch of boxes of clothes. I\\u2019ve brought one of them here with my daughter\\u2019s clothes from where she was four and five. I brought them because her godparents at the time, their daughter is three and most of the clothes have only been worn a couple of times so they look brand new, including this pair of white girls shoes that you put on for special occasions. She only had them on for one two-hour thing, it was a funeral, and I carried her for most of it. The godparents are looking through their daughter\\u2019s own clothes trying to find a pair of shoes. I tell them that there\\u2019s a pair that I brought in the box of clothes. The godmother says nothing and continues to look through the boxes of clothes as though I haven\\u2019t spoken. Her husband says, \\u201cOh thanks, that would be great! Where is the box that you brought?\\u201d I tell him, \\u201cI put it over there.\\u201d He goes that way and starts looking for it. In the meantime, I\\u2019m sitting on the couch with their daughter. She normally doesn\\u2019t laugh and I know this. She doesn\\u2019t express her emotions very well. I\\u2019m very careful not to pick her up and toss her around the way some adults do with the kids or disrespect her space. I just sit on the couch and if she wants to come over, she will. I look at her and talk to her. I notice that she has a really old face for a three year old. I find this compelling. I\\u2019m really paying attention because I think she has some wisdom that has perhaps been overlooked due to the fact that she\\u2019s in a three year old body. She eventually toddles over and sits on my lap. She\\u2019s facing me and she grabs my hands. You know how kids run up your body and then they somersault while they\\u2019re holding your hands? She does that. I\\u2019m a little surprised because I know she\\u2019s reputed to be standoffish; however, I\\u2019m quite familiar with this move so we do it. After the second one she starts to laugh and her parents look at me with some surprise. The mom looks annoyed and comes over and tries to grab her, but she says no to her mom and does the somersaults a few more times and is laughing. By this time, I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I ask the child if it\\u2019s okay if I set her down on the couch. She says she doesn\\u2019t want me to do that. I say, \\u201cOkay, how \\u2018bout we stand up and help look in the boxes?\\u201d She agrees to do this but wants to be carried. I shift her so she\\u2019s balanced on my left hip. We walk towards her dad who finds the shoes at that moment. He says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s get you dressed.\\u201d I give her to her dad. Now I\\u2019m on some kind of rescue mission and am supposed to go up to the top floor of the building. I walk over to the stairwell. It\\u2019s like if you look at stairs from the side of the building and you can see that there\\u2019s a forty-five degree angle going up and then another one going up, and you can see all these angles, but you can also see the ones going down as if you\\u2019re right beside it and seeing through the glass. They look like this when I\\u2019m trying to go up them. The down-going stairs are mixed in with the up-going stairs. The first time, it\\u2019s quite clear to me and I can see the up-going stairs anyway. I go to the top floor where I\\u2019m supposed to be. There\\u2019s a woman and I have an appointment with her. I make it for the appointment. She talks to me but I don\\u2019t remember what we say to each other. She gives me some kind of assignment that I\\u2019m responsible for. I take it. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s something physical; it\\u2019s something in my mind. I accept it. I go back down the stairs. I realize that I have a question that I\\u2019m uncertain about. As soon as I get to the bottom I want to go back up the stairs. I do one flight and then the down-going stairs exerts itself in front of me. I go down one flight anyway because I have to in order to access the up-going stairs. But the access for the up-going stairs isn\\u2019t there, so I go down one more flight thinking I\\u2019ll find it but I don\\u2019t. Now I\\u2019m feeling concerned because I\\u2019ve gone down two flights of stairs and I don\\u2019t want to be down here. I see the door open and it\\u2019s really dark where that person has come from - it\\u2019s like an underground parking lot with that creepy kind of feel to it. I think if I watch what they\\u2019re doing then I can find the up-going stairs. But they\\u2019re running really quickly. I can hear their footsteps going up but I can\\u2019t see what path they\\u2019ve taken. I follow the up-going stairs anyway. It takes me back up the two flights that I mistakenly descended. Then I\\u2019m trying to continue going up back to the offices but the down-going stairs keeps mixing up. This time I\\u2019m smarter and I don\\u2019t take the down-going flights, I just keep trying to find the up-going ones. After a little while I realize I can\\u2019t and think I\\u2019ll have to go on the mission anyway with these questions in my mind.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Colourful Night\\u201d I\\u2019m with my first boyfriend. It feels like we\\u2019re in Mexico. There\\u2019s a beach and an ocean. It\\u2019s nighttime but there are so many colors of lights and festivities of people gathered together. The sounds of music and lights are all off in the distance. I\\u2019ve been to Mexico and it feels like that colorful joyous culture. We\\u2019re walking along the beach at night. He\\u2019s telling me that he\\u2019s only here for a little while. I feel a bit sad about that. I want him to stay longer. As we walk a little farther on, it\\u2019s really pretty. It\\u2019s a white sand beach and there\\u2019s a moon. You can tell the color of the sand because the moonlight is bright. We approach a path leading down to the beach from somewhere else, and I can see it in the darkness. We turn up it and start to move away from the beach. There\\u2019s a night market with crafts and people who have made crafts and set up a makeshift vendor tent out of a few simple poles and some canvas or fabric. There are a lot of these makeshift tables. There\\u2019s a camaraderie kind of atmosphere as we walk through. They\\u2019re background noise though because we\\u2019re in conversation with each other and we\\u2019re walking through the market, we\\u2019re not stopping at the vendors or looking at their crafts or what they have to offer. We come to another path. We turn up it, away from the vendor market. It\\u2019s like beach apartments, flat, one level and very simple, obviously places where people sleep because the sound from the market and ocean is reduced here. I suddenly realize that I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re sleeping - I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s sleeping or where I\\u2019m sleeping. I\\u2019m getting tired and want to lie down and rest. He says we can sleep here for the night and indicates a door on his right. He says it belongs to his brother. So we open the door and right inside the door is a bed. We lie down on the bed and I close my eyes for a few minutes. I wake up and feel like it\\u2019s not that much longer but he\\u2019s behind me and his arm is around me. It feels soothing even though I\\u2019m awake and listening to the sounds around me. In a little while, he wakes up. We both sit on the bed and have a conversation where I tell him that I want him to stay longer. He says he can but there are a few conditions. He wants to be able to work on his art and he wants his own space. There was something else he wanted, but I can't remember. I think, \\u201cOkay, these are easy to fulfill and he already does that anyway.\\u201d Without any second guessing or additional contemplation, I agree. He seems really happy about this and so am I. We leave the apartment and walk back through the marketplace. We go a little farther and there are some raw materials like clay and wood. He\\u2019s poking through those looking for something he can use. I\\u2019m doing the same thing but not with the same materials. Some other people start to infiltrate the environment where we\\u2019re doing this right now. They\\u2019re talking to me and asking me what I want to use these materials for. They\\u2019re asking what he wants to use these for, too. There\\u2019s the feeling that they are causing a disconnect between us. I don\\u2019t want to answer all these questions. It doesn't matter to me what they think. I just want to collect my materials and see if he\\u2019s ready to go. That\\u2019s how the dream ends with this constant onslaught of interruptions that are obstacles to what I\\u2019m really trying to do.\"],[\"\\u201cCOVID Dream\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house, it might even be the house I grew up in - it looks like that, it\\u2019s a bungalow. I\\u2019m with my dad and we\\u2019re planning to go to Niagara Falls and spend the day at the amusement park. There are some other kids going, too, and I think they\\u2019re just friends of mine. I\\u2019m teenage me. I\\u2019m talking with my dad about what rides we\\u2019re going to go on. We discuss the fact that it\\u2019s cold and we\\u2019re going to need to wear extra clothes. So there are some conversations about what we\\u2019re going to bring because we don\\u2019t want to carry too much but we want the right things for the weather. I\\u2019m excited about going. My ex-best friend who I was still friends with when I was a teenager, calls on the phone and I tell her that we\\u2019re going. She says she\\u2019s going to meet us there because she\\u2019ll be in the area. She asks me what time we\\u2019ll arrive. I tell her we haven\\u2019t finished figuring that out yet and I\\u2019ll call her back when my dad lets me know. I hang up the phone and it suddenly dawns on me that the reason the amusement park is still open right now and not crowded is one of the reasons we decided to go. It\\u2019s not normally open this time of the year when it\\u2019s cold and near Christmas. We also wouldn\\u2019t go to an amusement park because it\\u2019s so crowded and the lineups are too long. I realize that these criteria are in existence because of COVID. It sinks in that we also should not be going. We can't bring all these people together, we can\\u2019t circulate through the park. I feel this moment of rebelliousness where I want to go anyway at the same time I know we can\\u2019t and we won\\u2019t. I voice this to my dad. He doesn\\u2019t say anything. He silently realizes the truth of this, too. I pick up the phone and call my friend back and tell her we won\\u2019t be going after all. She asks me what I\\u2019m going to do. I tell her I\\u2019m going to be home but we realized that the reason the amusement park is open later in the year and there\\u2019s hardly anyone there is because of COVID so we can\\u2019t go.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Grandmother\\u2019s Shoes\\u201d I\\u2019m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I\\u2019m at the dining room table. There\\u2019s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It\\u2019s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I\\u2019m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s her or someone else. Maybe it\\u2019s her with someone else\\u2019s face but she\\u2019s not alive anymore. Here she is and she\\u2019s acting like Nancy but she doesn\\u2019t look like her. We\\u2019re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they\\u2019ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad\\u2019s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, \\u201cNo, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.\\u201d I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she\\u2019s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they\\u2019re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, \\u201cThese don\\u2019t look very comfortable!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYou might be surprised. Try them on anyway.\\u201d So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It\\u2019s too small and it\\u2019s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d I put it back in the crate. She says, \\u201cTry another pair.\\u201d I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they\\u2019re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they\\u2019re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there\\u2019s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren\\u2019t completely flat, they\\u2019re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it\\u2019s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, \\u201cGrandma, I\\u2019m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.\\u201d They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re a seven anymore. I believe I\\u2019m now an eight. But isn\\u2019t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say anything, but she says, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can\\u2019t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, \\u201cWait here one moment.\\u201d She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, \\u201cTry these ones on.\\u201d She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they\\u2019re flat and they don\\u2019t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they\\u2019re comfortable. She says, \\u201cYou can have them.\\u201d She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, \\u201cAre you guys ready to go yet?\\u201d They\\u2019re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re wearing Grandma\\u2019s shoes.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cYes, she gave them to me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.\"],[\"\\u201cNo-ga\\u201d (instead of \\u201cyoga\\u201d) The dream starts and I\\u2019m in a room with a cork floor and boxes piled up along the sides of the walls. It\\u2019s a weird shape, not a square, not a rectangle. It has three sides as though it\\u2019s trying to make itself into a square because it\\u2019s really big but they aren\\u2019t even a triangle. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat is this room? What am I doing here?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to formulate a context in my mind for what the room is. I close my eyes for a moment then I open them again. Now the room is a square and it\\u2019s arranged itself. There are panels. The boxes are gone but the cork floor is there. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cAm I in a hot yoga room?\\u201d There\\u2019s still one wall that\\u2019s open but there\\u2019s a hallway that leads out to it. Then a woman comes in. she\\u2019s wearing a fake wool sweater, one of those thready ones, and baggy corduroy pants and hard-soled shoes that lace up. I notice that she has really unproportionately small feet for the size of her body. Her hair is kind of dirty. She tells people to roll their mats out and get in rows. I am in a hot yoga room. I see that there are about twenty people, all dressed for hot yoga class. Suddenly I have a mat and it\\u2019s rolled out and I\\u2019m sitting on my mat. She walks across the floor and now it\\u2019s that spongy gym kind of floor. I notice she still hasn\\u2019t taken her shoes off and this kind of bugs me. However, I sit on my mat. She tells us to put our feet in front of us, bend our knees and roll back a little bit then forward a little bit, so you\\u2019re just rolling back and forth on your tailbone. I think, \\u201cTailbone? Why aren\\u2019t we rolling all the way back so it goes through our spine? Maybe she has some kind of plan.\\u201d So I do it. Then she starts talking about something way off topic. A minute goes by and people are still doing this. She starts fussing with something in the corner of the room. Now another whole minute has gone by. I\\u2019ve stopped rolling on my tailbone because I think I\\u2019m going to get uncomfortable, but some people are still doing it. Then she starts talking about food. By this time I\\u2019m off of my pelvis and I\\u2019ve come onto my knees and I\\u2019m sitting there in a hero\\u2019s pose waiting for her to tell us what she wants us to do next. She starts lecturing about something, I don\\u2019t know what. I just realized that in the dream I thought it was a man that was leading the class but it\\u2019s not till the lecture starts that I realize it\\u2019s not a man, it\\u2019s a woman and it\\u2019s not because the appearance of him, it\\u2019s because I get a glimpse of the name tag pinned on her thready sweater that says, Stephanie. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh. Ew.\\u201d Then, she pulls something out of her pocket, takes a bite out of it, wraps it back up and puts it back in her pocket. She\\u2019s talking with her mouth full and it\\u2019s gross. I\\u2019m really disgusted by this person. Now about fifteen minutes have gone by and she still has everybody in this rolling back and forth on the tailbone thing. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOkay, shoes on, baggy corduroy pants, thready sweater, name tag, this isn\\u2019t even a yoga instructor!\\u201d They\\u2019ve pulled her off the desk from somewhere and told her to go in and teach a yoga class and she\\u2019s stalling. I lean over to the person beside me on the left and we make eye contact and I say out loud, \\u201cShe\\u2019s just stalling for time.\\u201d Then the person on my right has moved their mat, which isn't a mat, but a flannel sheet that they\\u2019ve folded up into a mat shape, close to me so it\\u2019s one inch from mine yet there\\u2019s two feet of space between them and the mat next to them. I lean over and look down the row. The woman has got something going on at that side of the room so people shuffled to make room for it. But I know she\\u2019s not actually doing something, but staging to stall for more time. I tell the person beside me, \\u201cCan you please move about six inches that way because you\\u2019re in my space?\\u201d They do. They pick it up and move that way. Now I\\u2019m bored so I lie down on my stomach and put my head on my hands and think I\\u2019ll just close my eyes and rest until the hour is over. Then she tells people to get up onto their knees and put their hands together \\u201cas though you\\u2019re doing your prayers.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the point of this? We\\u2019re going to be on our knees for like fifteen minutes.\\u201d I don\\u2019t do it. About five minutes go by. Now she\\u2019s at the back of the room and she\\u2019s doing something else. Suddenly there's a garbage can and she has things spread out all over from the garbage can. There are some people on their knees but most people aren\\u2019t doing it. Then there are two people with someone in between them and they\\u2019re supporting the person with their arms on either side and the person is limping. They\\u2019re carrying them out of the room. I think, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I say to the person in front of me, \\u201cHow could you possibly hurt yourself in a class where nothing has happened?\\u201d The three people leave and I think that maybe they just staged this in order to escape this horrible yoga class. I realize I\\u2019ve said this out loud and the people immediately around me are laughing. The woman comes up that\\u2019s teaching but not teaching and she\\u2019s asking what\\u2019s so funny but no one will tell her. All of a sudden, a portal opens up and I\\u2019m in a different room. There\\u2019s someone with a camera and it\\u2019s me but I\\u2019m also watching. There\\u2019s this beautiful woman and she\\u2019s turning in a circle and moving her arms so that they look like they\\u2019re actually moving faster than they are. The way the light hits her body, at the moment the picture is taken, it looks misty and the light is hitting itself and refracting off the mist. It\\u2019s an absolutely gorgeous shot. I want to recreate this so that I can take a picture and have a picture. The person that has taken the picture, I turn to them and say, \\u201cIf I give you my camera, will you take the picture at exactly the moment I tell you to?\\u201d The person agrees. I walk forward into the alcove and stand there. I start turning around in a circle, lifting one arm up, moving the other one to the side, and then when I get to the 180 point I switch arms and turn my body and switch arms. So I\\u2019m turning and I\\u2019ve turned enough times that I start to see that light, it\\u2019s circling around and coming back and I know when it hits my arms it\\u2019s going to expose the mist that\\u2019s already in the room. I say, \\u201cOkay, take it now!\\u201d They do. I leave the alcove and come back and look and there it is, it\\u2019s caught the light on the water droplets. I thank them. Then I\\u2019m back in that horrid yoga room again. It\\u2019s almost over. People are lying face down or are they just lying like that because that\\u2019s how I was lying when I left? Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cDinosaurs\\u201d I\\u2019m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We\\u2019re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she\\u2019s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she\\u2019s telling me these things, she\\u2019s asking me what I think. I\\u2019m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I\\u2019m doing is I\\u2019m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we\\u2019ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, \\u201cMy coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.\\u201d She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I\\u2019ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it\\u2019s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it\\u2019s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it\\u2019s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They\\u2019re wrestling with each other but they\\u2019ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They\\u2019re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I\\u2019m stunned. I\\u2019m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it\\u2019s winter and it\\u2019s freezing. Now I don\\u2019t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they\\u2019re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don\\u2019t seem to see where I\\u2019ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I\\u2019ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they\\u2019re looking around but their bodies aren\\u2019t moving, They haven\\u2019t located where I am yet. They\\u2019ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I\\u2019m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can\\u2019t leave them in there! There\\u2019s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they\\u2019ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they\\u2019re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can\\u2019t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn\\u2019t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he\\u2019ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I\\u2019m up to now and they\\u2019re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to shred the door. I don\\u2019t have any boots and it\\u2019s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don\\u2019t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I\\u2019m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I tell her what happened. She\\u2019s strangely puzzled and doesn\\u2019t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Coffee Pot\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It\\u2019s snowing out. There\\u2019s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it\\u2019s still snowing. There\\u2019s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there\\u2019s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don\\u2019t. The house is brick. It\\u2019s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it\\u2019s taller than it is wide. It\\u2019s old. I can tell it\\u2019s old because the glass isn\\u2019t flattened by a machine, it\\u2019s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I\\u2019m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It\\u2019s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say \\u2018it likes\\u201d because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It\\u2019s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it\\u2019s mostly black. It looks like it\\u2019s made of cast iron but it\\u2019s not because it\\u2019s light when you pick it up. I think it\\u2019s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It\\u2019s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There\\u2019s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It\\u2019s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I\\u2019ll sometimes look for it. I\\u2019ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it\\u2019s going to disappear and come back again. This day it\\u2019s missing. I have a roommate. She\\u2019s more like a neighbor but she\\u2019s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I\\u2019m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I\\u2019ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I\\u2019m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, \\u201cHave you seen the coffee pot?\\u201d She continues to look at me but doesn\\u2019t nod her head yes or no. I say, \\u201cJust in case you\\u2019re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you\\u2019re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?\\u201d She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I\\u2019m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It\\u2019s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it\\u2019s happy. When it\\u2019s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it\\u2019s been. It\\u2019s like every time it comes back it\\u2019s a little bit different. Sometimes it\\u2019s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It\\u2019s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it\\u2019s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.\"],[\"\\u201cDecorating\\u201d I\\u2019m back in the house at W Square. My brother and my niece have come to visit. They\\u2019ve brought some things with them. Everything they bring has to hang from the ceiling. There\\u2019s a swing and a light fixture. My brother has brought so many things for the kitchen that he has built another cabinet that goes where the stove used to be. Now I don\\u2019t seem to have a stove anymore because there are cupboards there now. My niece\\u2019s dishes are in there and there are internal racks so the plates stack on their ends. I look to see what\\u2019s in there and the plates are plastic and made of ivy so they don\\u2019t hold anything. I question why these are so important that they need their own space. My niece replies that she likes how they look. I would rather have had my stove. I\\u2019m saying this out loud and asking my brother his plan for the stove and where he\\u2019s going to put that. He\\u2019s busy putting the new light fixture up on the ceiling. It\\u2019s about four feet long by one foot wide. There are three wire cages that have round discs on them. The last one is a really long dunce hat shaped cone and it\\u2019s just a bare bulb. It\\u2019s really, really bright. He\\u2019s installing it and he\\u2019s busy with his tools. I go out into the hallway. I\\u2019m putting up the swing in the living room archway. I\\u2019ve got a hook for it. I insert the hook into the stucco of the ceiling and I\\u2019m turning it around and around and around until I feel it grab. There\\u2019s not much hook left and I\\u2019m skeptical that it\\u2019s going to be able to hold any weight once the swing hangs from it. I hang the swing from it anyway with the intention to ask my brother once he\\u2019s done with the kitchen to come take a look and see if he concurs with my conclusion. While that time is passing, I\\u2019ve got two great big vases that they\\u2019ve brought and some flowers. I put one on the table that\\u2019s just inside the hall and another on a long skinny table in the hallway just before the living room. I arrange the flowers in it. I\\u2019m standing back and admiring; I like how these flowers look in the two vases. They make a nice diagonal line of flowers when you open the front door. In fact, they arrange in perspective, one behind the other so it looks like there\\u2019s one giant bouquet of flowers. I think this perspective is interesting. While I\\u2019m kind of lost in that perspective, my niece sits on the swing and is swinging on it. I notice that the hook is separating from the ceiling just as I suspected. I say, \\u201cStop swinging!\\u201d and I grab the swing because I know one more swing would have taken the whole thing right out and some of the ceiling would have come out with it. I\\u2019ve caught it in time and she gets out of the swing. I take it off the hook and get some glue and some of the material that the ceiling is made out of and I put the glue around the hook. I\\u2019m sticking the material with the hook to the stucco ceiling and am repairing the hole. I have this idea as I\\u2019m screwing it back in that now it\\u2019s a permanent fixture and I didn\\u2019t know that they were going to stay forever and now I\\u2019ve made this swing forever. It\\u2019s done now. I go back into the kitchen and we\\u2019re setting up for somegames. My brother has made this big chart and they\\u2019ve gone out to get food. I\\u2019m in the kitchen by myself and looking at what he\\u2019s done and figuring out what everything is for. I still wonder at the practicality of taking up so much space for these plastic plate ivy underlays. I notice that I\\u2019m squinting because the light from the ceiling without a shade over that long cone shaped bulb is so bright. My niece comes in and says, \\u201cOh look, this is supposed to go over the light.\\u201d It\\u2019s this beautiful cone shaped Tiffany lampshade. I put it over the light bulb. It not only makes the light comfortable, but it\\u2019s really pretty. I notice as I screw it over the light that you push it in so it accordion-pleats over itself, so now it\\u2019s no longer this long dunce cap shaped thing, it\\u2019s flush with the other two round plates on the ceiling. I\\u2019m relieved about this. My brother has returned with some games. He\\u2019s got a piece of bristle board that he\\u2019s going to use as a chart to keep track of the scores. He says, \\u201cLook what I\\u2019ve done. I\\u2019ve put your son right across from you on the chart and your daughter on the Y-axis and your daughter across from you on the X-axis. Here\\u2019s the point where you are and I\\u2019ve made it just a heart.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Firefighter\\u201d I have a new puppy. I\\u2019ve put him on a towel beside my bed. I\\u2019ve just set my teacup down on my bedside table and I\\u2019m debating whether or not to take him out one more time before I go to sleep. He\\u2019s not housebroken yet. I know I\\u2019ve just taken him out so I think I have a couple of hours to sleep and I\\u2019m really tired. I close my eyes and go to sleep. I wake up abruptly, something startled me, a noise. In that startle, my arm shoots out and knocks the teacup off the bedside table. It falls to the floor and smashes. I pick the pulley up from the towel and wiggle my feet into my shoes. I walk out of the bedroom, up about five stairs and outside. It\\u2019s still the middle of the night, though. I set the puppy down in the grass. He snuffles around a little bit and I hear him peeing. We walk a little farther so he can poop. I think that he does so we go back in the house after spending a little time outside. I put him back on the towel, take my shoes off and get into bed. Then I look down and there\\u2019s poop on the towel. I think, \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t stay out long enough, I thought he pooped.\\u2019 I get another small piece of towel and pick the poops up. I walk across the hall and flush them down the toilet. I pick up the two towels and am looking around for something to put them in. I notice I have a dog crate in the corner but it doesn\\u2019t have a tray in the bottom. I wonder if you can buy those separately. I\\u2019m trying to find another towel, a clean towel for the puppy to lie on. Then some people that I know from yoga start to file into the room. The room turns into a gym. I still have the puppy. People are wanting a yoga class now. They see the puppy and start talking about him instead. They ask me what kind he is and such questions. There\\u2019s a commotion at the side of the room and I see two firefighters. They\\u2019re both dressed in the fireproof coveralls and one of them has an axe. I wonder if there\\u2019s a fire going on and if we should be vacating the room. I pick up the puppy again, put him under my arm, and approach the two firefighters. One of them looks familiar and I feel like I know him from somewhere. They say there is a gas leak. The one that I think I know says I should come with him while he shows me the sight of the leak. We climb up a ladder, the kind you\\u2019d see in a submarine that goes straight up. There\\u2019s a small opening that also goes straight up. I give the puppy to my friend and climb up the ladder following the firefighter. When we get to the top, it\\u2019s like the landing on the upstairs part of my house. There\\u2019s a big wheel, like the kind in a submarine that you turn. It\\u2019s like a waterproof lock over doorways. He sits down beside it and says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s where the leak is; it\\u2019s down there.\\u201d He indicates the other firefighter and says, \\u201cHe went down to shut it off earlier but he left something down there and it could still be open, so he needs to go back down and turn it off.\\u201d He turns the big wheel, takes the hatch lid off so it\\u2019s open, and the other firefighter slowly descends down the stairs. We know it\\u2019s going to take a while. For some reason I think it\\u2019s about half an hour. The guy I know is now sitting and anxious and he keeps taking his hand to the side of his neck. We need to sit here and wait because we have to open the hatch back up. There\\u2019s also the possibility that it might explode. It is quite nerve racking. I ask the guy I know if he wants me to do a little thai massage on his neck. He says, \\u201cOh yes, that would be great. Just a minute.\\u201d I can\\u2019t remember if he says he needs to wash his face or wash his face and hands. I wait. I go in the bathroom and also wash my face and hands. I wonder if I should brush my teeth but I don\\u2019t. He comes back down. He takes a lot longer than I think. It feels like it\\u2019s maybe twenty minutes and I\\u2019m thinking we don\\u2019t have much time left before we have to open the hatch up again. He does come back up though and sits down. I do the neck sequence and the back of the shoulder sequence - just the seated sequence - and then the time is up. I sit across from him again at the hatch. He looks at me. I guess it\\u2019s the thai massage afterglow and he says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen you like this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s gazing at me with this look that is open and maybe unconditional love.\"],[\"\\u201cA. Street\\u201d I\\u2019m back on A. Street, which is a street I bought a house on with Omar and a couple of other friends. We bought it to flip. We took everything out of the house when we bought it, including the drywall, the plumbing, and the electricity. We created three apartments from it. I lived in one on the main floor for a little while until the basement was fixed up into an apartment, and then I moved out. I kind of supervised the building, collected the rents and did day-to-day jobs that a landlady would do. In this dream, I\\u2019ve returned after being absent for a long period of time. It\\u2019s because I want to sell the house and I want to move myself. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m living far away from there like I do in waking life. In waking life I want to move and I\\u2019m trying to get the money I need to do this. I\\u2019ve got a couple houses picked out that I want to move to. They\\u2019re across the street from the Fairground. I just don\\u2019t know how much they are. I\\u2019ve contacted one of my friends who is a real estate agent to help me with this. She meets me at the house on A. Street. We enter. We start looking around. She\\u2019s doing it with her real estate agent\\u2019s eye. I\\u2019ve got a clipboard with paper and am going to write down the things she says to do to stage the house and what she arrives at as an estimated value. As we\\u2019re doing this, the tenant comes down from the upper floor apartment. She talks to us for a little while about mundane things. Then she says that she would like to move into the main floor apartment when the house sells. I tell her, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s a good idea except that you are on student welfare and they pay rent directly to us. This apartment is much more expensive than the smaller apartment that you have on the upper floor. How can you afford to pay for this? Are you working now?\\u201d She says she\\u2019s not working but she thinks she can budget so that her student welfare still covers the more expensive rent. I tell her that I don\\u2019t think this is realistic and I do some math with her. I say, \\u201cThis is how much your rent is, here\\u2019s your utilities. You won\\u2019t have anything leftover for food after that.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI can make it work.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry but this isn\\u2019t realistic. I can\\u2019t sign off on this.\\u201d She walks away disappointed. The tenant that lives on the middle floor is not present, but I have a key to go through his apartment. In the dream, I\\u2019m thinking that he\\u2019s away. But at the same time my conscious mind acknowledges that he has passed on. His apartment has been vacant for some time. We go through it and note that it needs some paint and some cleaning. We go back down to my apartment. My cats, who I have brought with me, one has gotten out to the backyard. I\\u2019m wondering who left the back door open. I go into the backyard to pick it up and notice that the other one has got out. I don\\u2019t understand this because I brought them in a carrying cage which I set down in the kitchen while we did this walkabout with the real estate. It feels like things are starting to get out of hand already. I\\u2019m in the backyard and notice that there is a tenant in the basement and there wasn\\u2019t one there when I left. I can hear some loud music coming from it. I wonder how we\\u2019re going to get in. Now I\\u2019ve got both cats under my arms and go back up the back porch stairs. I put them back in the carrying cage and firmly latch the door. I tell my friend that there is a tenant in the basement and I\\u2019m not sure if we can look in that apartment. She\\u2019s already on it. She\\u2019s pushing the door to the apartment open and I tell her, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that. That\\u2019s the door to the apartment. You have to knock first.\\u201d She thought it was just a walkway. So she pulls the door closed again and knocks. This guy comes to the door. He\\u2019s wearing jeans and no shirt and he smells like beer. I feel a little bit nervous, but she\\u2019s quite confident and asks if she can look around. I don\\u2019t go in but she does. I hope she\\u2019s okay. She comes back out and makes a few more notes then goes back up to the kitchen. We sit down on the couch and she starts going through the things that need to be done. The whole thing needs to be painted and it all needs to be cleaned. She has a few extra things like door latches and some fixtures. She says, \\u201cAll in all, you should be able to get this ready for about $2,000.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t have it, but I can put it on credit. That\\u2019s not too much to come out of the equity.\\u201d Then she says, \\u201cBut I have something else here we\\u2019re going to have to put on the windowsill when we have the open house.\\u201d I look at it and think, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d It says, \\u201cWrit of Sale.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a lien. The mortgage was not paid on the property. So the bank owns it.\\u201d I wonder how this could possibly have happened? I paid all the rents religiously every month they went in the account. Who has used this house as collateral for something and never paid it? I wonder if one of the other two partners has done something surreptitious. At that point I see Omar and he\\u2019s walking by the front of the house. I go out the door and am trying to talk to him but it\\u2019s like he isn\\u2019t really aware of me or the house, he\\u2019s just walking by. I can\\u2019t talk to him or get to him. Now I\\u2019m really disappointed and can feel that in my heart. I\\u2019m not going to be able to get the funds together to move. I don\\u2019t want to sell the house and disturb any of the process that was already in place before I start to try and sell it. The tenants have been paying the rent. Whichever one of the partners who have set this up to repay the debt, I need to leave that in place, or else I\\u2019ll end up being financially responsible for something I didn\\u2019t do. I ask her, \\u201cHow do I reverse this? How do I stop this process that I\\u2019ve put in place?\\u201d Now she\\u2019s talking to her boyfriend who\\u2019s sitting on the couch and they\\u2019re talking about a concert that they\\u2019re going to. They\\u2019re going to see Teenage Head at an outdoor amphitheatre just on the edge of the reserve. I think, \\u201cOh, I didn't realize Teenage Head was still alive or that they had done more than one album.\\u201d The boyfriend says, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re right, they only ever did one.\\u201d I respond, \\u201cSo, they\\u2019re just going to play all of those songs?\\u201d I wonder why people would go see a band that hasn\\u2019t been around for so long. I think maybe they have a strong local following and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cMain Duck\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It\\u2019s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There\\u2019s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There\\u2019s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there\\u2019s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That\\u2019s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend\\u2019s son who I\\u2019ve sailed with before. We\\u2019re having something to eat. I\\u2019m not very hungry. I\\u2019ve brought a few things to eat that I just don\\u2019t feel like eating right now, so I\\u2019m just waiting. People are deciding what we\\u2019re going to do for the day. We\\u2019ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It\\u2019s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There\\u2019s a town and we\\u2019ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I\\u2019ll just eat there when I\\u2019m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They\\u2019ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can\\u2019t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I\\u2019m hoping there\\u2019s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There\\u2019s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it\\u2019s really messy. I\\u2019m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There\\u2019s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, \\u201cWow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she\\u2019s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we\\u2019re just staying for three days. That\\u2019s okay because there\\u2019s not a lot to do here and I\\u2019d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don\\u2019t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We\\u2019re back in the reception room. The owner\\u2019s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he\\u2019s going to leave right now because it\\u2019s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he\\u2019s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend\\u2019s boyfriend tells me that we\\u2019re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that the opposite direction?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the direction we\\u2019ve been going.\\u201d I say, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I indicate where we\\u2019ve left from and where we\\u2019ve tied up and I say, \\u201cThis is south.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo here, I\\u2019ll show you on a map.\\u201d He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship\\u2019s made and we\\u2019ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We\\u2019ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn\\u2019t make any sense to me.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Race\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house with a couple of rooms. The rooms are spacious. There\\u2019s a dining room with some kind of chandelier in the middle of it. There\\u2019s a foyer between the dining room and living room. The foyer has a door that goes to the outside. The living room is also spacious with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The foyer that joins these two rooms is quite large with some furniture in it as well. I\\u2019m with another woman and two men. The other woman and the man have a relationship together. At the beginning of the dream I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re off in the shadows. I have a new relationship with the man that I can see. He\\u2019s white and has dark brown hair. I can see his features, they\\u2019re a little angular and pointy. He\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am and slim. We\\u2019re just getting to know each other. We talk somewhat. I have a feeling I\\u2019ve been set up with him but I don\\u2019t feel any energy with him and he\\u2019s a stranger. We do start talking. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing together really, but we move around the rooms and talk in different areas. I can feel myself starting to warm toward him. He can be interesting. I am starting to like him. The woman and the other man come out of the shadowy part of the dream. The man starts to talk to the man I was with. The woman approaches me and asks if we want to leave to go out for the day. We\\u2019ve both separately agreed that we do. The vehicles are motorcycles. The man I\\u2019m supposed to ride with seems to be recovering from some kind of injury and his buddy is asking him about the injury. He tells him that he thinks it\\u2019s going to be okay. Now I look and see him flexing and extending his leg at the knee. He says, \\u201cSee look, everything seems to be fine.\\u201d So, we put chaps over our legs and put on heavier coats. We go outside, get on the motorcycles and tour around for a little bit, then come back. We come back in. I'm involved in some meal preparation, as is the other woman. The two men are also doing things to help prepare. Then we have a meal on the table. We share the meal, all four of us. The other two recede into the shadowy part of the dream and leave me with the man I was speaking with and riding with all day. Now I can feel the pulse of a growing sexual energy between us. We explore this for a bit. We\\u2019re in the foyer when we\\u2019re doing this. The other man interrupts us and tells my partner that he needs to come out and look out the living room window and see what\\u2019s going on. My partner and I separate. The two men go into the living room. I\\u2019m tidying up and getting dressed. I see that there are a number of vehicles on the other side of the street, different models of Jeep from the more rugged safari type to the SUV type. Each one has a driver that has gotten out and they\\u2019re kind of congregating on the shoulder of the road. I can see also that some of them have been injured. The men are clapping each other on the back warmly like, \\u201cYou did it!\\u201d Others are rotating one shoulder up and back and bending elbows as though the shoulder and elbow have been injured but are now starting to heal. I notice that it\\u2019s a sunny day now whereas previously very little light was coming in the windows and it was semi-dark. This living room is very bright now. We\\u2019ve got a great big long console tv like the kind people would have in the 1960s that sits in a big wooden box. They\\u2019re starting to gather around to watch a big race. Some of the men that are coming in are quite elderly; whereas the man I was sharing energy with is in his forties. It\\u2019s a variety of males. They\\u2019re finding seats in this giant living room on the couches lining the walls. They\\u2019re setting up to watch this race together and it seems to be a really big event. I\\u2019m not interested in it, but I am interested in what\\u2019s going on in the backyard. I walk out. The living room exits into a greenhouse, like a sunroom, which then exits out into the backyard. I realize I\\u2019m in my grandparents\\u2019 house on the north shore and I have been all along. I\\u2019m looking for the rose bushes. All the gardens are only at the beginning with shoots, like the beginning of spring after a long winter. I\\u2019m just going from garden to garden to see what\\u2019s coming up. I go back into the house. I see the woman\\u2019s features now and it\\u2019s my stepmother. I tell her that there are some things coming up in the garden. She then just recedes into the kitchen. I check on the men in the living room and they\\u2019re still watching the NASCAR races. Then I notice that someone recently has cut roses and put them in vases in the sunroom. The roses are this deep pinkish red in the middle with light green petals around the outside. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat an unusual rose,\\u201d and I wonder who cut them and from which bush. I go back outside. Now it\\u2019s like the beginning of summer and everything has bloomed. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and I look down the length of the lawn. I can see the top of the boathouse and it has grass on it. I want to go lie there because I want to feel the waves and hear them under my body and soak up the sun. I go around to the side of the house first to see if the red and green roses came from there. No rose bushes there. There\\u2019s some kind of gardening shelf, just a little bench made of painted white wicker, with a small cupboard underneath. I open it up to see if I can find gardening tools. Somebody has already opened it and there\\u2019s a pair of gardening gloves and some shears and a couple containers sitting on the top of the bench. I wonder who has been wearing them and if it\\u2019s the person who has been cutting the roses and putting them around the house. I go a little farther and see that one of the plants is a Rose of Sharon but it\\u2019s not in bud yet. Then I decide to stop looking around the other side of the house and walk down the length of the lawn to lie in the sun for a little while. Then I can hear people talking, the doors opening, and people starting to leave. I know the race is over. I stand up and walk back towards the little bench to see if the gloves and shears are still there. I\\u2019m going to try and find some roses because I want to put some in my own room. My stepmother comes out and says, \\u201cYou really like it here, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s beautiful. Can we stay for a while?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think so.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good. There\\u2019s so much space. It\\u2019s nice not to have to squish myself into a room or turn my body sideways to get into a closet or out of a door.\\u201d She agrees. I say, \\u201cEven if I had a brand new house, they only make the bedrooms nine by nine now. I really like having a big bedroom.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, we can stay for a little while.\\u201d Then she recedes again. I go back into the living room. My friend and his friend are the only ones that remain. His friend asks him to come out for another motorcycle ride. My friend asks if I\\u2019d like to come and I say, \\u201cYeah, I would.\\u201d We get our motorcycle clothing back on and get on the bikes.\\u201d We\\u2019re driving down the highway. It goes around a bend and something I\\u2019m carrying, I think it\\u2019s a roll with a change of clothes in it, flies off the bike and I can see it beside the road. We don\\u2019t stop until we come to an outdoor cafe. I can feel that my right eye has tears in it that have been running down my face, but my left eye is dry. The friend of my friend says, \\u201cI wondered if you were ever going to express any of your grief. I can\\u2019t believe you haven\\u2019t done it until now.\\u201d I tell him that I was, he just couldn\\u2019t see it. He says, \\u201cHmm,\\u201d as though he doesn\\u2019t believe me, and then says, \\u201cWe should go back to the corner and get what you lost.\\u201d I agree and let them take me there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe House on Rowan Avenue\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house on Rowan Avenue. I\\u2019m in the living room trying to arrange the furniture so that there\\u2019s a seat in front of the fireplace for someone who wants to sit there, a space so they can still talk to someone on the other side of the living room, and then I\\u2019m creating another seating arrangement so that two other people can be in the same room but not be in the same conversation as the one beside the fireplace and the small settee across from it. There are three or four of us that have all rented a room from some absentee landlord that owns this house named George. I know that there\\u2019s only three bedrooms on the middle floor, but two of the people are a couple. I\\u2019m aware that the top floor of the house is still vacant. I\\u2019m having a conversation with my friend, Alice and it\\u2019s she and her partner that share one of the bedrooms. I don\\u2019t know the other person in the other bedroom. They were there first though and saved the room at the end of the second floor for me because they knew I lived there before and would like that bedroom. I\\u2019m really appreciative of this. Alice is telling me that she wishes there was a quiet place for her to sit in the living room because sometimes she doesn\\u2019t want to be part of the conversations. This is why I\\u2019m trying to arrange the living room to make separate spaces in it. I\\u2019ve moved the couch so the back of the couch kind of delineates that there\\u2019s almost two rooms in the living room. I\\u2019ve set up another small chair with its back against the back of the couch, so it further defines a line between the end of the fireplace and this one. I\\u2019ve left enough room for someone to walk through so there is some Feng Shui flow from the conversation space, past the couch to the fireplace and then back. None of the chairs or the couches have legs, they sit directly on the floor. I have a couple of tall floor lamps that I\\u2019ve also used. They\\u2019re sitting on the edge of the flow that the Feng Shui creates, as though it\\u2019s a road. I\\u2019ve put the floor lamps around the row instead of the parameters of the room. To me it feels like I\\u2019m setting up one world then moving along that flow of air into the other world. I\\u2019ve started a fire in the fireplace now and have pulled the chair up. It\\u2019s a round chair, like a circle with an indentation in the middle that\\u2019s full of pillows. I can sit and feel the warmth of the fire on my face and hear the crackling of the wood. Then, I see other people coming in the front door. People are gathering in the kitchen so I get up and go into the kitchen to see who\\u2019s there. There are just some people making tea. I can feel the hum of contented voices chatting amiably. I leave there and instead of going back to the fireplace end of the room, I choose the other end. I\\u2019m sitting there thinking that maybe I\\u2019d like to get a book. Alice enters the room and talks to me about how she wishes she had a space that was more private. I say, \\u201cWell isn\\u2019t the top floor still unrented?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I believe it is.\\u201d I respond, \\u201cWhen I used to live here, we kept that area as a separate reading room and we fixed it up and made it understood between all of us that if you felt like talking or entertaining, that it would be done in this living room, leaving the other room just for alone space. We put all the books up there and had a light and some comfortable chairs.\\u201d Her face lights up when I tell her this and she says, \\u201cYou have no idea how much I would love that!\\u201d She gives me a big hug and says, \\u201cThank you so much for suggesting that.\\u201d Then we go upstairs as do the other two people - her partner and the mysterious person from the other bedroom. We create this space and agree to use it as such. Then we\\u2019re back downstairs. I can see the stairs going up from my seat. I see a woman with a boy of about maybe seven or eight running up the stairs, which is something else we don\\u2019t do. All of us have agreed to go up the stairs quietly because there\\u2019s no carpet and the wood creaks. But they boom up the stairs and you can hear them go up the first then the second flight. My heart sinks and I know they\\u2019re going to the top floor. I look at Alice and say, \\u201cIt appears George has rented out the top floor.\\u201d Her face just drops. I feel disappointed that the landlord has rented the space to someone with a child because none of us here want to have anything to do with children at this point in our lives. The child upsets the agreed upon social order we\\u2019ve set up with the quietness. We\\u2019ve all agreed that if we come in at 3, we\\u2019ll tippy-toe, take our shoes off and softly pad around in our socks. One of us gets up for work at 5. We\\u2019ve agreed to go down the stairs slowly and not wake up the people that work late in the night and have to sleep in the morning. We\\u2019ve also lost our reading room at the top. I think how unfair it is that he\\u2019s rented to someone with a child without talking to us first. It seems to have defied or betrayed some kind of agreement we had for the tenants who are cohabitating in this house.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Dream\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand the structure I\\u2019m in. There\\u2019s a room, but it's not really closed in. It has a ceiling but it\\u2019s almost like it doesn\\u2019t have any walls; it\\u2019s just a floor and a ceiling. It\\u2019s good wood floors. There are shelves but I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on them; they go in a vertical line, shelf after shelf, and there\\u2019s a walking space between them. At the far left corner of this room is a desk and a chair and a glass partition like the kind movie theatres have as a small ticket booth. There are no walls on this partition though - it just has the glass front where people would pass the money and tickets through. My daughter is sitting in there. She\\u2019s writing something or doing something on the desk with her hands. I can see a level below this floor. It starts around where the desk is and is about four feet lower. Again, it doesn\\u2019t have any walls and it extends back with a ceiling above it. I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s back there. There\\u2019s a guy sitting there and he\\u2019s also at a desk and he\\u2019s got a swivel chair. He\\u2019s swiveling around, getting something behind him, putting it back on the desk, maybe calculating something, typing it in, swiveling back and forth. This guy is somebody I just met. My daughter has passed something under the glass that I\\u2019m supposed to pick up. I\\u2019m on the same floor as she is. I need to get to the floor underneath and I don\\u2019t know how I get there, but I\\u2019m just suddenly there. As I go to pick it up, the guy sitting at the desk underneath the pickup window - kind of in the way- swivels his chair around and I have to lean over him to get it. I am trying to stretch my arm over him because I think I can reach it. I come within a couple inches of it but I can\\u2019t get it. Instead of swiveling back and forth in the same pattern and rhythm as he was, he deliberately stays there a little bit longer and makes body contact with me. I can feel a sexual energy between us. I\\u2019m intrigued by this but also feel that I need to finish whatever task my daughter passed onto me. I wait for him to swivel back the other way so I can grab whatever it is she passed me. It\\u2019s like a tube, it\\u2019s tiny and pen-shaped. I get it this time. It\\u2019s in my hand. I go back into the shadowy part of this lower level that\\u2019s on the same floor as he is. I\\u2019m doing something but I\\u2019m unaware of what it is. When I come back out, he\\u2019s standing up in his chair. My daughter has come out from behind her desk and they\\u2019re talking to each other. He kisses her on the mouth. She looks surprised and backs up a step. I wonder why he did that. I think they really do have a lot in common. Then the dream just ends. But there\\u2019s something else, when he kisses her on the mouth, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a golden light all the way around them both. It illuminates her surprise and it\\u2019s quite a beautiful light. I can see how golden and young and beautiful her features are. It doesn\\u2019t change the fact that she\\u2019s surprised, but it\\u2019s that the kiss left that beautiful golden light around her face and head.\"],[\"My boyfriend and I were robbed by three of my classmates.\"],[\"Playing basketball with my friends as a kid again\"],[\"speaking to a higher self - and told me 'time is meaningless'\"],[\"I was originally working as a normal officer but then I was attacked by some monsters which were from the sky suddenly. I was killed. When I awoke, I became one of them. I started killing people and eating them. But then, very unexpectedly, I turned back into a human girl again. I was standing at the middle of a highway. A girl was running forward to me on that moment because there were monsters chasing for her. I followed her and ran very fast. We finally went to a little village but till the last moment, we were still running and escaping from those horrifying creatures.\"],[\"It may sound a bit deep, yet my most memorable dream was hearing my Dad cry in our bathroom. When I approached him in my dream, he was reluctant to say why he was crying. Eventually, he spoke how it was about tally marks on his tattoos. There was something wrong with them, apparently.\"],[\"I am walking home on a street as a child to a place I used to live.  I look up at the sky and I see round circles of various sizes all with the pattern of a candy flower; swirls of red, pinks and whites.  They are spinning, some are closer than others the sense of depth is visually clear..  I know that they are going to be pulled by a magnetic gravity like force into an invisible void, like a black hole but it isn't black, it is just a force that I can feel as an energy and yet I can't see actually see it.   I look down at my hand and I am holding a type of futuristic lottery ticket that shows a sequence a numbers: 0.0, 0.1 and 0.3, 4, 6 9 and so on.  I know in my mind instantly that the spinning balls are planets and each planet represents a number and the numbers on my tickets are ones I have selected, so a winning number refers to one of these planets. I panic because I have 'bought' too many numbers that I could not afford.  I look more intensely at the numbers on the electronic ticket and D0.1 turns red.  Yes, I am a winner! is a thought in my mind.  But I need more, I have still spent too much, the D0.1 letter and number  is in a sequence of more, about 4 and half lines.  Then there is a line gap and another set, I am searching in the next set of numbers with some that also have letters for another one to turn red to indicate a win.  One more does, and my total win starts to accumulate at the bottom of the ticket - I feel uneasy even though I  know I have re-covered my loss but not by enough to get me where I want to be.  I never actually see the amount I have won, it won't appear, it is a blur.     I wake up, fall back a sleep and go into another dream.  I wanted to go straight back into that dream (I am able to do this, the most times I have woken and gone back in is 3). The feeling of fear from that dream (above) stops me returning.\"],[\"timeloop\"],[\"For some reason I cannot quite remember, I was over across the street to the neighbour's (a couple 30 years older than me - I am 51) looking for a place for my sister to rest (my sister is afflicted by a complex health condition in various forms since more than 30 years). I go up to the last floor which is like an airy small attic, walls laid with oak wood and windows through which light enters abundant, still a small space though (I have no idea if they have a place like this), and I find there a bed where my grandmother is lying smiling to me (my grandmother has been dead for 15 years and I am named after her), covered up in a light brown blanket, as if she is cold but getting more comfortable by the minute. Suddenly I become aware that I have been introduced to the room by the neighbour (the wife) who reassures me that everything is going to be all right and then vanishes. I find myself grabbing a broom and sweeping the room, the next thing I know is that my sister is also there also sweeping energetically and we smile at each other while I chat to the neighbour (the husband) who has just appeared. I remember that I am supposed to be making the room clean and comfortable for my sister and go to check the bed, and where my grandmother was is now my sister, wrapping herself in the same blanket and looking as if she is trying to settle herself. I am shocked and I then find myself immersed in cordial conversation with the neighbour (the husband) and am dimly aware their son (they only have two daughters) is somewhere around. The son strikes me as not very clever or interesting and, feeling slightly guilty for thinking this, I redouble my efforts at a vivid conversation with the neighbour (the husband) to show that I am still friendly and approachable. The neighbour (the husband) comes very near me talking about some theory which I understand and to which I agree, he comes nearer still and a fraction of a second before he does I become aware that he is going to kiss me and although I am not all right with this I do nothing to prevent it and prepare myself to kindly endure it, to my surprise it is a very satisfying kiss on the lips for which I close my eyes. When I open them, their daughter has come in the room and she reprimands me gravely, I feel very embarrassed and guilty and exposed and I worry about how my husband will be able to understand what this was all about.

Also in that dream there were some guys who robbed and a very strange chase began.\"],[\"Second Dream: (I only remember the end) I dreamed that I was wearing a high school uniform, I was going to ride a bus and in the elevator to the bus we were AKe, OAn, BGr, and I don't know why but AKe could do the Split but he could not play charades, and in the end he lost two bags that were actually additional, because they were not from any of us students.\"],[\"I dreamed that I was going to classes with RCa, FMa, QJo and other people. We were at the UTP of Panama at the FIE, the classes were like in the study hall. Then I realized that I had a subject related to logarithms and chemistry with the theory teacher with the last name C\\u00e1ceres and that I was not going to graduate because the laboratory teacher did not tell me that she would no longer let me enter classes. I realized that at home, in my room, because I was supposed to have that class that day but one of my classmates told me not to go because the teacher had taken me out of class. So I decided to go talk to the theory teacher why if I didn't pass the course, I couldn't graduate, and they told me that he was a bad teacher and that the lab teacher kicked me out because I was three times late. In my brain I thought that I had to graduate and that I had to get the theory teacher to accept another job instead of the lab grade. So I went to talk to the theory teacher and I think that now I would have to qualify many things, but he accepted me to continue giving the subject and not to put F.\"],[\"In another dream, I dreamed that I was in a drawing competition, people danced with a background theme related to music and I had to make a drawing that would express it. There were three drawings and the last one looked like an image from Machika's video Anyway there it was.\"],[\"Last night I dreamed of Hashiko, I dreamed that there were two of them, and that we were

effect\\u2026.So I give up, he is in charge\\u2026.Everyone is naked?....We are in a bathroom?....Later, as I go to close the front door here at the ranch, a group of four swallow birds quickly dart by me and fly inside\\u2026.oh oh, I worry and wonder if that is a problem\\u2026.They must have figured out that the arena is gone, and they are looking for new places to make their nests\\u2026.But

our house, to make sure the door and windows are closed\\u2026.The water is likely to come way up the beach\\u2026.I see it come, and the water does go unusually high on the beach, but it does not actually reach the house\\u2026.that is a relief\\u2026.Later, I am in a room with a couple of family members\\u2026.A woman has been swinging on a big rope suspended from the ceiling\\u2026.She gets off, and now we get a turn\\u2026.I take the lead, as we swoop back and forth\\u2026.But it is difficult because the woman just keeps standing there in the middle of the room, so I have to make sure I avoid hitting her as we swoop around the room\\u2026.I experiment with speed and angle, and find that I can arc upwards so high I can touch the ceiling, on both sides\\u2026.it is lots of fun\\u2026.At another point, I have been in a sexual situation with a woman, and I have a slight erection\\u2026.Then I meet Jones, he is very happy and we give each other a big hug\\u2026.but I can tell he is aware of my erection, and he tries to prolong the hug\\u2026.I turn and twist away in his arms and try to lead us into the other room, it is very awkward and uncomfortable as he keeps hold of me and presses his hips into me\\u2026.Later, a brief image: I am with an unattractive older woman, she is in a nightgown\\u2026.I happen to see her from the side, and a perfect profile of her

dying\\u2026.As the apartment building starts to sway, I turn in fear and push Ronald forward, and to the right around a corridor, saying run, run, run!....I look back as we go, and see the building falling towards us\\u2026.It looks like we are just beyond where the top of the building will hit, but there will still be a massive blast impact\\u2026.I lead Ronald to a place behind a sturdy structure, which seems as safe as anything, and I tell him to duck\\u2026.The building crashes, and a huge concussion knocks us down\\u2026.he cries out in surprise and alarm, while I feel something thump off my back\\u2026.Earlier, people are trying to wash cats\\u2026.Cats can get the virus, too\\u2026.Other people think that things are getting better, but I know they are getting worse\\u2026.\"],[\"Other people are trying to influence and shape what we can and cannot do\\u2026.They will switch whether it is safe to go out or in?....I am fine inside here, but now if I go out,

worried that is too long, it is dangerous for them\\u2026.\"],[\"A girl and two older women wait for a process to unfold\\u2026.It was taken over by other people, who are in charge of it

fly\\u2026.he has to wait like this for a bigger process to happen\\u2026.I feel a little sorry for him, just standing like that, waiting\\u2026.A small black plastic tube is part of it\\u2026.And a

her\\u2026.Earlier, I am with some children\\u2026.Two of them jump in the water of a lake, and I get in too\\u2026.I help them get out, grabbing the boy by the collar and helping the girl up the little ladder\\u2026.The boy is surprisingly heavy, pulling my arm down\\u2026.I worry, will he sink?....That would be bad\\u2026.I tell the girl, Lancey?, to hurry up the ladder and out of the water, so I can pull the boy up and out, too\\u2026.\"],[\"Lots of comings and goings, people are agitated\\u2026.I go down a street, and see a cat laying down, motionless\\u2026.I wonder, is it dead?....It looks like our cat Levi\\u2026.Later, I see a pile of old cat puke by the toilet\\u2026.that\\u2019s gross\\u2026.I wonder how that could have been sitting there for so long?....\"],[\"I see a little white kitten in the street\\u2026.I bend down to greet it, and it comes to me, very friendly\\u2026.It jumps into the pizza box I am holding, I wonder if that is ok\\u2026.yes it is\\u2026.at some point, I go into a big bathroom, fancy like at a restaurant or hotel\\u2026.But lots of people are in there, talking in couples\\u2026.There is nowhere for me to go privately\\u2026.So, somewhat

confused\\u2026.I quickly grab one of the guys\\u2019 guns, a small snub-nosed black revolver, and toss it out the window into a ditch by the side of the road\\u2026.They have to go back to get it\\u2026.Later, I watch as a guy is in charge of a big process, from one long end to another\\u2026.a long horizontal extension\\u2026.But he is frustrated by the crisis, at not being able to do what he wants\\u2026.\"],[\"There are lots of little white objects like pills or balls in the ground\\u2026.people are supposed to work to find ways to deal with them\\u2026.But the followers of a woman get frustrated, and they dig the white things out of the ground so it will look like she has done the job\\u2026.But I can see it is the opposite, they just tried to change the appearance of reality to make it look like she succeeded\\u2026.\"],[\"Something about soil, or compost\\u2026.People want to test it for the virus?....to see if the virus is mixed into the dirt\\u2026.I somehow know my

people\\u2026.I go inside, get people in, then close the door\\u2026.The shark pushes hard against the door, forcing it open a few inches\\u2026.Scared, I struggle to keep it from breaking inside all

enough to hold me, I am fine\\u2026.Later, I am with a woman, we are running down a hallway naked\\u2026.We are excited, going somewhere together\\u2026.A couple other people are in the hall, we try to avoid them, and hurry past\\u2026.at the end, people are going to a new planet, but they find it is like a world of cloth and flowers, pretty yellow fabric on the ground, with red flowers popping

all\\u2026.At one point, I see a guy go up sneakily to a child who is among other suffering children, and the guy roughly folds the child\\u2019s legs into a fetal position, like a little ball, and says harshly, \\u201cSurvive!\\u201d\\u2026.Like the child is some kind of alien growth or species who needs to get through the crisis to do its mission\\u2026.\"],[\"Lots of images of people during the crisis\\u2026.do they have the virus or not?....all seems chaotic, no consistency between the images and whether people have it or not\\u2026.I get the sense people are lying, dissembling, trying

line, pressuring me\\u2026.I do not like it\\u2026.At some point I am with some other people, we are following a creek as it goes underground through a town, under city streets, buried below but still

once my box comes up, I do not know how to go out safely\\u2026.it is confusing, it seems we are back in danger again\\u2026.Later, I see the enormous base of a tall, ancient conifer tree\\u2026.sloped or fluted outward at the bottom\\u2026.I walk around it with others, there is a question of how to care for the tree, not harm it\\u2026.other people seem oblivious\\u2026.\"],[\"I

will be fine\\u2026.Later, I see some homeless guys on a street corner, playing rhythms with Quaker Oats big cylinder containers as drums\\u2026.I have an oats container of my own, with a handful of

moment, and say, yes, sorry, actually we do\\u2026.She is disappointed\\u2026.I am aware of the tension between my attraction to her and my feeling that we have to do the right thing, given the crisis right now\\u2026.wow\\u2026.I go back to get the shirt I left at the water\\u2026.I have a big roll of dollars in my pocket, it falls out for a moment onto the ground, I have to pick it up, and I wonder if the others see it, I do not want to show off\\u2026.I easily jump over a fence as we walk along\\u2026.Then I somehow fly up to the top of a tower, high above the ocean and beach below\\u2026.Another guy is with me\\u2026.I let him drop down, then I stop him with my mind, and bring him back up\\u2026.He is freaked out\\u2026.Without these powers I would be scared up here on a tiny white seat, attached to a thin white pole maybe a thousand feet in the air\\u2026.Then I am down on the beach, sitting on the sand, looking out at the water\\u2026.Can I make a water spout

over\\u2026.But we do not totally capsize, and we get to shore ok\\u2026.I help push and guide it the last part of the way in\\u2026.Later, I am with a group of people, helping them with files and

three glass boxes on legs with sand inside\\u2026.Lots of old stuff is still in there from a previous display\\u2026.I have to clean it out first\\u2026.I do not like that, I am annoyed, as I sift

good card to get at the beginning, because you can buy them first, but a bad card at the end, because then you have to pay the owner\\u2026.I think of how this card being in the deck forces things to

I frequently have dreams where I am someone else. This was kind of on the border of that.\"],[\"I had three dreams, the first one had something to do with records and putting them away on a shelf somewhere. I can\\u2019t really remember the second one anymore but the third one was detailed. My older sister was working somewhere new and I went to go visit her. It was really loud and there were a lot of rules - in real life she works as a lawyer but in this it was like a hip young fashion office. She took me to the break room but it was like a big party and there was lots of loud music playing but it didn\\u2019t bother me this time. Then all the sudden it got late and quiet and we were standing in twos of people with wooden pews behind us. This guy named Bass who had been flirtatious all of a sudden got serious and announced that his wife was dying. People shared stories about grief and I stood up and said, \\u201cI know you don\\u2019t know me but you can call me anytime even at three in the morning and I will listen. I will let you talk about them and I can just be there.\\u201d I gave him a big hug and he cried. He looked like somebody I went to high school with who was in my older sister\\u2019s class and died in a motorcycle accident, but it wasn\\u2019t quite him. I don\\u2019t remember his real name but it wasn\\u2019t Bass.\"],[\"I had a dream where the man from the first dream crept into the second dream. My recent ex was in the dream and we were skiing but I didn\\u2019t have the right gear (a helmet or a coat). I felt inadequate and frightened and he laughed at me. He kept wanting me to go break into a house \\u201cfor fun\\u201d which I thought was awful. I went to go find him and the house had little kids in it who were scared. I tried to comfort and distract them. The house was very modern and futuristic and I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to work the doors to get them safely out so I hid with them. The man from the first dream was gone by the end of this (he never went to the house with me).\"],[\"I woke up only remembering the last little bit of the dream. I was waiting for the elevator at an apartment building and holding my dog, Pinto. I wasn\\u2019t feeling well and started to faint (related to my chronic illness in real life) and there were two nurses at the elevator waiting. I asked them for help and they just kept talking. Then Mary, a nurse, I actually have worked with came to help. She carried me and my dog to my apartment and I remembered feeling embarrassed that she saw me like this. In real life this is not someone who has been kind to me at work, and I work extra hard to keep my heart open to her. In any case, then I woke up!\"],[\"I was in an underground hotel lobby with all the lights on. It had wood floors, wood ceiling wood-paneled walls. I\\u2019d been there before in another dream but not in real life. I was waiting for a massage at the spa. A bartender took my order and left, tipping his hat. I saw people but did not talk to anyone. I went swimming in the underground pool. The pool reminded me of a bath at a temple stay in Japan. Then I went into a dark stadium alone. Then I woke up.\"],[\"The dreams I remember mostly centered around my ex boyfriend and being unfaithful during our relationship and finding out later. In my dream I was confused and hurt. In real life I don\\u2019t think this happened but would not have been surprised, either. This is a theme though that comes up in my dreams about him often over the almost five years we were together. Wonder what else that may symbolize?\"],[\"Last night I dreamt that my late husband Caleb met me for a weekend away. He was young and I was older. We had a great time at a bed and breakfast, walking around and seeing my older sister Liz. We went driving back home but when I got off the exit it was all grassy and completely vertical. He agreed to take the car up the \\u201chill\\u201d so we got into two cars and I was following him but then I lost him. Then I woke up.\"],[\"This was interesting and maybe a first - I don\\u2019t remember my dream but woke up with a song playing in my head that was part of the dream. It\\u2019s called \\u201cAll Ways Love\\u201d by Tubby Love. It felt soothing and hopeful to wake up - love that song!\"],[\"I was with my same two friends, Emily and Tyler, and we were now in a village set in a different time period. Maybe it was the early 1900s. We split up to go find our way back home and each had different adventures. I can\\u2019t remember what they were but it was dark/night out. I felt safe but didn\\u2019t feel Tyler was safe because he is gay and it wasn\\u2019t accepted where we were.\"],[\"I was in a part of dream 2, but an old neighbor was there renovating a house. One of my ex\\u2019s dogs (that I consider like one of mine) was there walking through a building with me. He was going ahead to check for safety as it was under construction. It was dark and had a lot of steps both up and down. There was an older man working on the kitchen of a unit and he was an old neighbor of mine. He was showing me a decorative white porcelain fixture for the kitchen or bathroom with an early 1900s style delicate painting of a woman.\"],[\"I was with my late husband\\u2019s best friend's wife, Candace. She invited her younger teenage sister over who was wearing a yellow bikini top and tiny black shorts with a robe. There were older guys at the house leering at her and I felt like this could be very inappropriate. In real life I\\u2019ve never met her sister but doubt this would happen. I told her to maybe throw some clothes on and they called me a prude and insecure. I was angry about it when I woke up.\"],[\"I was living in a community again that was familiar from my dreams but I don\\u2019t recognize it from waking life. It was a housing development all alone in the high plains. It had snowed recently. I walked past a house that had been for rent but there were big burned wooden beams inside - someone told me it had burned down. I went to my house but the dogs were not there so I went to pick them up from my ex\\u2019s house. He was not there but there was a guy who called on the phone saying he was looking for him. Then he called me and asked me to get him to work on getting the Christmas tree put away. Then some workers came and tried to move it and it broke. He yelled and it made one of the workers cry so I hugged him.\"],[\"I had a dream I went to yoga class (I have not been able to go because of my health right now). Interestingly, it wasn\\u2019t day or night but underground again. I saw random acquaintances I knew in real life including a teacher who I used to run into randomly everywhere (Whole Foods, Trader Joe\\u2019s, gas stations) so much so that he used to joke that he wasn\\u2019t stalking me. I had recently messaged them to congratulate them on something they did and they had written me back to say they were wondering if I had moved because I wasn\\u2019t around and if I wanted to get a free pass to their class. I haven\\u2019t written back because I didn\\u2019t want to say anything about my health. I\\u2019ve recently had some news and am not sharing publicly yet, and I just don\\u2019t know what to say other than thanks I hope to be there soon. Back to the dream. Then I was able to practice in class and it was lovely!\"],[\"I was a man (not me) and part of a gang/bad group of men who were smuggling something. I was driving a car underground - deep deep underground - and every time I would come to a fork in the road I would stop to ask the leader which way to go. We stopped at an underground diner and had sweet potatoes and blueberry pie, it was run by a large African American woman and she was hiding her kids from us and she was obviously scared and wanted us to leave. The lighting was all underground with candles and low lights on the walls.\"],[\"I was a young girl (not me) at some kind of college I\\u2019ve never been to. It looked like Chicago but I\\u2019ve never been there. It was dark/night and we were going out dancing. I was with a friend but also on a date with a guy. It was like an 80s movie. We went to a bar and by the end we had sung karaoke and ripped up our dresses - suddenly I was wearing a long wedding dress and it was ripped to my knees and glitter/color all over it like a Cyndi Lauper video or something. It was free and happy and lighthearted but there was an element of danger lurking.\"],[\"Dreamt that my younger sister was in the hospital and had similar rare chronic disease I have (or they think I have).\"],[\"A scene at my grandparents\\u2019 lake cottage of taking care of my sister when she was a kid. She was being bratty and wanted to tear apart the room to play something called \\u201ckinex.\\u201d\"],[\"I was driving to a concert at night with ex boyfriend Rory and when we arrived it was my late husband Caleb singing. I think it was the afterlife. There was a woman singing and she was really into it. She said \\u201cI think I remember you from last time\\u201d and I introduced myself as Caleb\\u2019s wife and her face fell. Her name was Dawn Jo. It was dark. She looked concerned but I wasn\\u2019t at all.\"],[\"Had a dream my brother in law (who is an Army Ranger) broke into my apartment looking for info to use against my sister for their divorce.\"],[\"Had a dream I was driving with ex boyfriend Rory in a new city - he had just moved and we were going to check it out. It was dark outside and bright inside like a mall. We left and went to a party in New York and my late husband\\u2019s friends were there including Noah and a bunch of guys who represented his best friends. I left to go get ready and then woke up.\"],[\"I had a dream I was hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know and someone gave me a necklace that said \\u201cbeware\\u201d or something similar and mentioned my health. Then I went to meet roommates for a new apartment in the town in this dream. We decided to make tacos. When we went to the store we came across a drunk woman and she attached herself to us so we tried to take care of her, but when she became sober she wouldn\\u2019t leave. My older sister showed up to visit at some point and then I woke up. The dream was disorienting and confusing, I was annoyed by all of the people in it during my dream.\"],[\"I had a dream I was renting a room in a house or maybe like an RV from a guy. There was at least one other roommate. We were told to be careful plugging in our devices as they drained the system. When I went to bed I looked outside the window and saw trash and book bags on the ground, then saw older dogs sleeping outside. I didn\\u2019t know how I could sleep while these dogs were outside. I made eye contact with one who just looked so so sad. Then I woke up. The whole dream was set at night.\"],[\"I was wearing a fancy red dress and working some high level job as a politician. Some type of emergency (maybe a government attack) happened when I went to the bathroom. Some man I worked with in dream but not in real life followed me to the bathroom. I changed and then I woke up.\"],[\"This dream was surreal. I dreamt that I was with my high school friends at a basketball tournament but got stuck/lost somewhere. A young Ram Dass came to be with me while I was stuck in some kind of trap. It was intimate physically but not sexual. In some way he represented all teachers, all people. He was just loving me, literally it felt like I was being filled with love. I felt warm and peaceful, content. I have never dreamt of him or any other of my teachers before. I woke up immediately feeling warm and loved.\"],[\"I was driving down this road going over the speed limit. The sign said 50, although it was in a neighborhood so I knew it was over, and I missed a stop sign. It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow\\u2019s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I\\u2019ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids. Then I went to drive around looking for a gift of plates but all of the stores were closed. I remember bashing Trump in a few conversations.\"],[\"I was me but also wasn\\u2019t me - like me but not me now? I was skating around and around and around an indoor skating rink. There was a company offsite and I kept seeing people that I knew but I don\\u2019t know in real life but had met before in dreams. We were all going around and around. They were all faces of people I knew from some job but I never knew these people in my life now. It was all wooden and lit with artificial lighting and there was music playing and it felt like it was supposed to be safe but was not really. I didn\\u2019t want to stay but I couldn\\u2019t leave.\"],[\"In this dream it was deep deep sleep and it was dark out. I dreamt I was supposed to dance in a performance with my OT colleague Susan and my friend Kate who also works as an OT . We met and danced wearing clear gloves holding hands for rehearsal. Then we were supposed to meet for the final performance and I couldn\\u2019t get there on time. I was late and annoyed. I tried to get ready but had GI distress and then tried to do makeup but my eyebrows were gone. Then these men were coming down the road and I could see them kicking up dust. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a group of people and someone who looked like my older sister and we were walking in a place that looked like NYC, it was dusk, turning dark quickly. We saw an overweight man in a wheelchair at the top of the stairs and he asked us to push him down, we said no and he said it would help him get down the ramp. We started to walk away and he started to slide away and my sister caught the wheelchair. Then I think he had a dog with him. We all went to a dark place like a bar and these blonde women at the front were jeering at us and I lifted both hands and flipped them off (not something I would do in real life). It was forceful but dark and I don't know if they could see me. Another dream was I was in a large grocery store and people were eyes down scurrying around. Last dream I was watching a video of myself as a kid. I was injured and in some kind of sled on the grass but it was daylight.\"],[\"I had a dream I showed up in this house in the dark with the lights on. It was a cottage. There was a group of people already there. I knew I had been there in dreams but not in real life. It was attached to another house behind the driveway. The house had brown shingles with white icicle lights on it. I think it was winter. I was looking inside a window. There were people and they all knew each other but I didn\\u2019t know them. I think it wasn\\u2019t their house either- they were sheltering there where they were able to survive. There was an old dog bed that did not match the dog in the picture on the counter. I felt sad. There was a peanut butter jar, and I had a taste and threw away the knife and this made the group tell me (they spoke to me as one, not as individuals): \\u201cthat was a rookie mistake!\\u201d But it was not friendly. It was immediately safe but also dangerous, and I could not stay. I did not fit with them. I went to the back of the house and down to a small restaurant. There was a Jacuzzi with a lock on it. I think the dream before that I was walking the streets and there were police out everywhere. In another part before that I was driving around and I should not have been driving around, it was dark.\"],[\"It was dark and I was at the store trying to buy eggs. I bought two hard boiled and two loose unboiled eggs but I dropped them when I went to the counter. I apologized to the clerk but they wouldn\\u2019t look at me. I was returning to a house I was remodeling, all made of wood. It was still dark but there were lanterns. I felt lacking, apologetic, not enough.\"],[\"I don\\u2019t think I was me. I was a woman and I was being shown half of a house, a duplex. It wasn\\u2019t nighttime yet but not daytime - dusk and gray. It was a craftsman type house with a lot of wood details, and someone was showing me room to room to room. I was part of a couple but the man was never home. Another couple moved in and I thought they were moving into the adjacent duplex side of the house but they insisted on living on my side. Then the dream turned into a nightmare, we were cooking and chopping dinner and the woman started threatening me with the big shiny knife. I woke up and my heart was racing. I even thought I heard something in the other room but there was no other sound when I listened. Went back to sleep.\"],[\"It was dark, I was not me, I was an African-American woman and her daughter. I was both of them. The story played twice. I was one of them each time. There is a house we went to for safety and I think it was supposed to be a grandmothers\\u2019 house. There were old school hair mirrors on the vanity table. One night we left and it seemed like it was part of a wild game preserve or Safari or something - I don\\u2019t have a reference point for. They were giving tours at night to school children, I think. We weren\\u2019t supposed to be there so we stayed alongside the underpart where they couldn\\u2019t see us in the shadows. I remember holding onto the crumbling side of dirt and rocks and looking up. You could see the stars and you could see the man, hoping he could not see you. If you got out far enough you were free but it was dangerous like a desert. It was daytime in the desert and you could see it. The first time we went, I was the mom. I tried to hide behind a tree but he saw her and we had to get on our knees. Somehow we got away. The second time we did the same story and I was the daughter and we were much more clever. I woke up with my heart pounding.\"],[\"I was helping a slightly older couple sort through and donate clothing - I think it belonged to someone the man knew. I held up sweaters that did not fit him or were very feminine. There was a whole truck of them, some of the sweaters were not tightly woven or too small. I called my sister Sarah. In the dream she was my sister but we were the same age I think (in real life she was born on my 9th birthday).\"],[\"I was at a small bar concert or something and the woman who cuts my hair was a proxy for me to buy cowboy boots and jeans. It was night.\"],[\"I was in Asia and in a crowded bustling city at night. I was with two companions but they didn\\u2019t talk to me. I had several iPhones. We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I\\u2019m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn\\u2019t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn\\u2019t have it. I was staying alone in a hotel room that was like a train compartment and then it was dark and raining. I woke up sweating.\"],[\"I was in a dimly lit yoga class in what looked like a barn or wooden room and there was a front section for people who could practice on a mat and I was in the back on a seated section where it was darker. There were people with me but it was hard to see them. It was a teacher I used to see a lot on Sundays, and it was a class I used to go to every week before I got POTs.\"],[\"I was working in a house for someone. It wasn\\u2019t dark outside but it wasn\\u2019t light either- a place I\\u2019ve never been in real life but in my dream I\\u2019ve been there before. It was old fashioned; it looked Victorian style - lots of lace and a huge heavy dining room table with claw feet. I was hurrying to clean up before the owners came home. There were at least two dogs with me, one small/medium sized and golden brownish and one larger and brown. I think they belonged to the owners of the house but I took care of them. I think a big wave came at the end of the dream with water rushing everywhere and then I woke up (or thought I did) and I thought my Apple Watch was calling someone but when I checked later it wasn\\u2019t. It seemed like it really happened. I thought I heard, \\u201chello, hello\\u201d in a deep female or lighter male voice. I double checked my iPhone and my Apple Watch which I was wearing to monitor my heart rate. I wasn\\u2019t scared but confused.\"],[\"It was dark. I don\\u2019t think I was me. I think I was a brunette and was some kind of spy or something. I was meeting up with some man at a restaurant for an exchange, but I saw him sitting with a woman and was surprised. I felt jealous and betrayed. I walked up to this man. I think I said something clever and mean, and I left something on the table. Later, I had to go back and retrieve something from a dark brick one-story building, I wasn\\u2019t supposed to be there. Somehow I got caught and the package opened and then all these people came out of the ground but they were duplicates of the same set of people, replicating over and over and over again, and then more started walking out of a school bus. I don\\u2019t think I knew the faces but they were familiar in the dream. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my ex and we were going to a festival or something and we had to pick out a tent and we were looking at all the different fabric types and debating which one to get. I was advocating for waterproof. We were joking about one that was an American flag.\"],[\"This one was more emotional. I woke up with mixed emotions. In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn\\u2019t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that\\u2019s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows\"],[\"I was in the woods in a house and getting a FedEx delivery sent to my sister Susan\\u2019s cottage. In my dream we all lived near each other in the woods.\"],[\"My apartment building at night was outside. Instead of how it actually is, there were floor to ceiling windows and someone was showing me the closets and how they were different and somehow this explained why I was sick. Then this man invited me into his room in the unit and he looked like my ex\\u2019s friend Franco but was not him. He was sitting on the bed with prayer flags behind him and he was trying to explain something to me but I did not want to listen. In real life I have an aversion to him, his energy always feels like coyote trickster or something to me - like always up to something, so it was weird to come up in my dream.\"],[\"I was making jewelry out of a flimsy kit. I left the kit on the side of the road and these boys about age 11-12 found it. They were beating up their friend and I tried to stop them. They didn\\u2019t want to make jewelry at first but then they tried it and liked it. I left but had to go back because I left purple earrings for my little sister, Sarah.\"],[\"It was dark but like old western themed muted gray outside too. Women wearing long skirts lining up to practice shooting guns. Metal sounds clinking everywhere. Buckets of shells. Dirt on the ground. Dusty targets that were also like big bowls. Big wooden containers of supplies. Waiting in line for big guns. I could feel the vibration of the kickbacks from the shots. Big guns like shotguns, little guns and the targets. The big guns had bullets that came out with rubber tips that looked really phallic. I don\\u2019t remember much else other than it felt very purposeful and we weren\\u2019t talking or joking, we were training.\"],[\"Baby on my hip, not sure if it was supposed to be mine, but felt like I was babysitting. Following someone downstairs to an underground bar. There were only women. All happy and clustered and drunk, laughing. I was following someone to a Fingernail bar. Woman in a gold sequin dress talking to other women squeezing by her. Going to get plain nails and dip them in the cup with gold glitter.\"],[\"I was in a room in a house and there was a workout video playing of doing floor abs and it was like 80s leotard old school. Something I haven't seen or thought about in years. It almost looked like a contemporary art experience. Then three loud noises \\u201cboom boom boom\\u201d and I woke up. My head on fire.\"],[\"I had a dream that my little sister Susan was having an affair on her husband with someone who reminded me of my ex. I was watching it like a movie and there were red long rugs rolled up in a big ballroom and they were running away. The sky and everything was navy blue like the ocean. I had no emotion - normally things like this even when I know I\\u2019m dreaming or wake up from the dream get me riled up for a minute but I felt nothing.\"],[\"There were two parts to the dream - the first part I was with somebody but I don\\u2019t remember who, and it was dark and we were basically squatting at some building and we knew we weren\\u2019t supposed to be there (but we stayed there anyways) and there was some kind of election. We knew we had to leave because there was a new owner that came and we couldn\\u2019t stay. So we left and we went running through the woods and I lost the other person. I had to jump all these fences like one after another after another but they were set up really close to one another, so I would jump one and literally the next fence would be one foot after it. Then there are these artificial lights and I came across the stadium and the security guards were outside and I started jogging like it was my plan to jog there the whole time and look for this high school. I went inside and met this class that was gathered inside talking about their plans for graduation. Somebody said that they were accepted to medical school, somebody else was talking about something that they learned about themselves...like an introduction and it was artificial lighting like in the science lab and for some reason it was a high school. I told everybody, \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you at the University of Connecticut,\\u201d and I was telling them that I went there for high school. We played against them and always lost and I was coming there to find a job. I don\\u2019t think I was me in this dream.\"],[\"Fragmented dream. I was at work in our primary group room at the hospital with a few of my coworkers and my manager walked in for a huddle. We pointed up to the ceiling and showed her how it was buckling - it\\u2019s the kind of drop ceiling that looks white with a grid pattern- it was bulging with something that looked like pillow stuffing. We all went to get a closer look and see if we could fix it. There was also a magical component to the dream. I wish I could remember more but it was something like after this happened someone painted me with a wand and I had the pastel colors again and went for a walk by myself. It was so ordinary but it was otherworldly.\"],[\"I was at a house in the kitchen and I\\u2019ve never been there before. It was older and everything was worn down and white but cared for- my ex was there and he was angry. I don\\u2019t know why. I was cleaning up a broken garbage bag on the floor and trying to put everything inside of the next one and it kept poking through and I realized they were brooms and brushes and of course they would poke through. Someone came to the door and it was a whole group of people who were actually banging on the door. There was a redhead woman wearing a pink dress and I think she was a trans woman and she said she needed to marry her wife and now she couldn\\u2019t. The men behind her looked threatening and we let her inside.\"],[\"The last dream I saw my old friend Luke in the parking lot and he asked where I\\u2019ve been and invited me to a party on a train. I got to the party and it was like boxcar apartments on the train and everyone was playing guitar. There was some kind of game or guitar competition, but it was really crowded and while it looked fun, I just wanted to get off the moving train and away from all of these people, mostly men. Something about it didn\\u2019t feel safe.\"],[\"I was driving over the bridge - I\\u2019m pretty sure it was San Mateo bridge - and I drove over it more than once but I don\\u2019t remember why. The road was really bumpy and I think I was by myself in the car the first time, and the second time I was with somebody else. I was in a big hurry and there were a lot of people driving over the bridge. In real life I never drive over the bridge\"],[\"I was in a neighborhood of people I don\\u2019t know and they invited me to come for a dinner in a garage. There were poster signs everywhere and there was a large blonde woman and some younger blonde children. She was celebrating something and making everyone food. When I came by I introduced myself and sat down and put on a face mask. She got angry with me and said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need that here! This has ruined the summer for my granddaughters!\\u201d pointing to them. I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really ruined the lives of people who died, and she said, \\u201cName them, name your patients!\\u201d I tried to explain that I couldn\\u2019t for HIPAA and that I worked in mental health and that many people are impacted right now in many ways, but she was so angry, foaming at the mouth and said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to have a plate anymore you can leave!\\u201d\"],[\"Another dream. I was with a younger black man and woman, they were wearing protective gear but I don\\u2019t think I was really a character/actor just a witness in the dream. They were in combat. They locked the door with the kind of lock that is a circular handle that closes safes. They were exchanging fire with people across the street. It was all under control. It was measured and it felt like the future.\"],[\"I was inside of some building and was given a code to get snacks. The machine was so hard to figure out and I finally got some snacks but it was all chocolate kisses. I saw someone else with popcorn, so I went to try to get that and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with someone else and maybe a small group of people and we were trying to get furniture for an apartment for someone we know. I had to watch scenes in my mind of people negotiating with the landlord about the different animals they could have. They had two small white dogs and a very small pet pig or something and there was another really small alligator or some reptile that could only stay in the kitchen and pace north to south on the kitchen floor, and there was like some type of instrument that would let us know that it was only going north to south, and it had covers over its feet. The two dogs were small white and matching and they could go anywhere in the apartment. I think the apartment was somewhere in New York City. It reminded me of New York somehow - it was for a couple but I don\\u2019t think it was for me. I was watching this like a movie. I was back with the group of people then we all went to IKEA to get the furniture and it turned into a mob. We were all walking counterclockwise and shoulder to shoulder and kept going in a circle trying to grab the items that we needed and couldn\\u2019t communicate with the other people we were with about what they were getting and we just kept throwing things into a pile of pillows and rugs. I kept trying to work my way over to people to make sure we were getting the right things but it was impossible to maneuver and there were all these different huge pillows that go on couches oversized on oversized like too big for words and it was really frustrating and I don\\u2019t even think they were for me- they went to the people in this apartment. Then it flashed back to the apartment and the landlord was saying something about how the reptile was doing okay going north to south in the kitchen but that he\\u2019s been hearing the couple argue in the corner of the apartment. The apartment was dark with hardwood floors that were dark wood and white tiles and I\\u2019ve never been there before.\"],[\"I keep dreaming fragments - I\\u2019m drinking water or eating breakfast. Kurt Cobain was in one and we were talking about something. I think I interviewed him about causing a ruckus at city hall once. There was a family breakfast I kept eating and then realizing I was NPO (nothing by mouth) in my dream.\"],[\"I was on several floors of a house with a circular staircase and I\\u2019ve never been there. I think I was me. I was trying to get to the top for privacy and peace just to rest and there was a white soaking bathtub and a white cozy clean looking bed and I wanted to get clean and get in bed and rest but some force or somebody kept calling me back calling me back like gravity pulling me down from this room.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me- I was a woman like me but she was rich and coiffed and she was purchasing a home. It was a preview of the home with everything encased in plastic so it could be wiped down, even the art on the walls. I watched her walk to a white van with a man and then I woke up.\"],[\"Next dream, same universe as the beaches. I was driving a red convertible to the ocean again, I was with my ex Rory and his friends. We found a place to sit down on a patch of rocks on the water\\u2019s edge and there was a young black man right next to us and I couldn\\u2019t take my eyes off him, I knew him, the one from my other dreams. He caught me staring at him and I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, you remind me of my friend\\u2019s husband (I named him) but I know you\\u2019re not him. I feel like I know you.\\u201d He introduced himself quietly and smiled so I saw all his teeth but I don\\u2019t remember his name. His voice was so kind. He took off his baseball cap and put it on my head over my straw hat, and nestled it in to make sure it was on there. He said something about there\\u2019s only eight groups of us at this beach. Then he got in the water. Then Rory and I decided we were hungry, debating between tacos and lobster rolls so we started walking on this decrepit but very crowded boardwalk. We saw lots of artists, lots of homeless people. One woman was sitting in a wheelchair; her face was painted grayish white but her lips were moving and I asked if she was okay but she didn\\u2019t answer and everyone kept walking by. She was dying slowly right there invisible but how could you miss her. It was like her body was 95 perfectly entombed. Then the waves started to come at first splashed through the boardwalk and then bigger where we had to hold onto the railings. Then we turned to leave and the waves kept coming and washing out the boardwalk in every direction, the railing was not sturdy; there were areas it was replaced with children safety gates and didn\\u2019t feel sustainable and I held on by the tips of my fingers and felt the water lift the rest of my body up and thought I couldn\\u2019t hold on any longer. People were just holding on wave after wave and we were losing each other but I wasn\\u2019t panicked because I let my body just float when it needed to float and move when it could. The people with their feet on the ground kept getting knocked over. I shouted to let go, let go and hold on hands only but they didn\\u2019t listen. After what felt like forever, it stopped. I walked along the inside of the artist areas and people were in there with water on the floor but otherwise unaffected. A group of white young women wearing all white shirts and green shorts came in perfectly dry and complaining loudly that they weren\\u2019t letting people in because of the waves and I really gave it to them. I let them know about the severity of the ordeal and they needed to be careful too if they were going down there. They didn\\u2019t seem to care that people just died. They just shrugged their shoulders. Then my father in law was at the boardwalk and we were checking out all of the art and he turned to me and said \\u201clet\\u2019s get a tattoo!\\u201d In real life this is something he has been telling me about as a memory of his son, my late husband.\"],[\"I was in my ex Rory\\u2019s Jeep with the dogs and we were going somewhere too fast and I told him so and he said, \\u201cno we are fine.\\u201d But then all a sudden he realized it and we were skidding over mud and he had to slow down and we started spinning and I grabbed onto my dog and then we saw these large animals like dinosaurs with big bumpy patches all over them. Later we were on a sidewalk in lawn chairs that moved. We just sat down and he showed me that the road would move underneath the chairs, but the chairs would not move.\"],[\"Whew! Woke up and felt winded like I just was running. My dreams were dark but not scary with lots of grey and some beige and yellow. The last dream was vivid. I was working on my unit but it was the future, I knew because the young social worker had a mustache and it was turning gray. He poked his head around the door and said, \\u201cwe have more coming; we have to make room.\\u201d All of us, even the patients that could, made room for more beds. We lined the beds up so close to each other with no dividers and no rooms anymore, just beds next to each other and we turned the hallway into a unit. It was still the psych unit though. Some of my long stay patients were still there and one of them from a previous dream was in a wheelchair and these doctors came to see him but they hadn\\u2019t aged. They were like, \\u201cget up and walk,\\u201d and he did, but he was so tiny, like a little old man boy. He had stopped talking. There were mostly men on the unit, only a few women. One of the women was maybe a social worker from a place I used to work but she was getting admitted to our unit (not happening in real life) and she was angry, she was like, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna have to make me walk through that door!\\u201d The security guard Arshis kept asking me if I was okay, something he\\u2019s been doing in real life lately because there has been a real threat to me on the unit. There was something unsafe outside like a war zone or something and we were living and working there. We were staying there forever and it was gray out of the widows, there was no sun, no day, no night. I wasn\\u2019t sad, I was working and working the milieu of patients like I always do and I belonged. I couldn\\u2019t leave them.\"],[\"I was frantically trying to put items away on a shelf but nothing fit and I kept dropping everything. It was odd. It ends with a lot of jewelry.\"],[\"I\\u2019m struggling to recall everything but I have these intense memories of being with a group of people and bonding intensely because we had to and meeting in an apartment in a dark apartment somewhere. I don\\u2019t know if I was me but then we all got into this train together and someone else had to drive it. This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like \\u201coh shit\\u201d and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.\"],[\"I was doing something with my sister Liz who is older and we were having an outdoor party and there were configurations of people and we needed to figure out where they were going to be under the tent. She changed it and told everybody about it and took credit for changing it. For some reason this annoyed me and in real life this is something she would do and I would let it go because I don\\u2019t care. We were serving American food and Indian food and I don\\u2019t know why it was a big deal or a faux pas but it was definitely a problem to combine the two. I think there were fireworks too and the whole dream was at night.\"],[\"I was underground somewhere with my family and we were looking at the history of the fault lines and earthquakes. We discovered an inaccuracy! It was a big deal- for some reason we were in a ship and there was a lock (waterway) system and somehow this was related to the 1800s. We saw that after the earthquake in the 1800s (which in my dream I think I related to as big as the 1906 in San Francisco) they decided not to fix the underground area because it was all working. We followed the cracks on the floor and then realized there were less cracks on the other side of the room, and somehow this was significant. The imagery was of a big steel ship/boat with dark deep blue paint. Also in part of this dream I was having dinner with my dad by the water\\u2019s edge - by this lock system - and I had just finished eating with my sisters when he came late. I left them to eat together. My sister was going to order a snack. I went to go make myself a big parsley fresh veggie drink somewhere by myself in a hotel room. In my dream I remember thinking, this is a LOT of parsley, but this is really refreshing.\"],[\"I was with a group of older ladies on a trip and there was a scene of getting back into the back of a mini van to go home. They had to arrange themselves like squished in the van.\"],[\"I was watching a scene like on tv but able to participate, like wearing goggles. There was a middle aged black man and his maybe 11 year old son. They were talking about moving from California to Detroit area because the dad lost his job. The dad was playing with his son in the front yard somewhere. There was a golden retriever playing with them that I know in real life (my somewhat adopted dog who lives with ex) named Trevor. Trevor recognized me and ran over happily wagging his tail, telling me about his family. They were talking about having all four seasons in Detroit.\"],[\"Dreams ended with the picture of the sunset right before it gets dark on a tree, maybe a poplar with black leaves and what looked like striated pastels in the background. I wish I could paint. It was so beautiful. Peaceful.\"],[\"This was like a movie of myself from months ago -it was back in maybe March when my fever hit and the doctors didn\\u2019t want to do this for some reason but told me if I was serious about finding out what was going on health wise, I would need to shave my head completely: they were so hesitant about it, I didn\\u2019t even resist for a moment and was like \\u201cokay; let\\u2019s do this, When do I need to have it done?\\u201d and they said June and I said \\u201cbut it\\u2019s August\\u201d and then I woke up. There were yellow and red colors all around me. I was at the hospital for some surgery and they put me in a device and on the side it had a bunch of diagnoses to rule out but I couldn\\u2019t read them all.\"],[\"This dream wasn\\u2019t in black-and-white; it was like in dark blue and gray and white colors. It felt like it took place somewhere else entirely- no place I have ever been to in real life. The people I went to see in the dream were familiar to me in the dream but not in real life. I went to see a couple and I think in the dream I had known the male previously but it was years and years since I had seen him. When I got to their house we practiced yoga and I remember doing lots of hip openers and it was like I almost couldn\\u2019t get the deepest stretch because in everything I did, I was so flexible (this has not been the case in real life as I\\u2019ve not been able to practice like I used to). But the release that I felt from forward folds of all types was amazing - it was like I just folded into myself. I think I did a bunch of seated spinal twists, too. These are all things I can do in real life but for some reason in the dream I was like Gumby and I couldn\\u2019t find the tension to release half of the time. Then we all went to bed on the same bed, but it was not sexual. We just fell asleep and when we woke up we had to go somewhere so we scurried around getting ready and we were leaving. I needed to go back and do something like take my medicine or something like that. I messed up the covers and then I woke up.\"],[\"These are fragments: Gems underground. Chris Cuomo was having a party next door and it was just like you would imagine someone on tv is like in real life. I think I had been watching a lot of news or something. He was having a party and wearing a suit, maybe a plaid suit like old school. Young black man showing me where he died twice. Singing Hare Krishna. Woke up with maha mantra on my tongue.\"],[\"I was with a group of people all coupled up. We were younger and we wore plastic bags over our feet to walk downstairs. I don\\u2019t remember much more.\"],[\"I was with ex Rory and he was driving a car and it was familiar in the dream, but not in real life. Some workers outside are wearing masks and some not. We drove by an outdoor jewelry store (all stores have moved outside) and I thought I saw people taking things and commented that if I was security I would have to be careful not to assume everyone was guilty. Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He\\u2019s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said \\u201cI knew you would pull that card!\\u201d And I started to read it but couldn\\u2019t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said \\u201clove.\\u201d He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate. The lights went out and I couldn\\u2019t find any clothes that fit. Then I woke up and my heart was racing.\"],[\"I was driving in the same universe but in a car. I stopped into a small town and it was snowing. There was a movie theater and a menswear shop. I went into the shop and saw a friend of a friend who I knew from working in San Francisco a long time ago. I haven\\u2019t seen or thought of them in years. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I had a dream that I was waking up, which was actually happening. My brain was processing all the images and feelings and emotions and moods and I was categorizing them. It was like I was watching my brain work while I slept but I was still waking up. I can\\u2019t remember content; it was more just the operational bird\\u2019s eye top level view of sorting and organizing.\"],[\"This was so fragmented - I had a dream that I was watching myself on a phone call on a corner having a serious conversation about something and then watching a neighbor come across me who was across the street from me. They had ching length white hair. They seemed pleasant and they had a red hammock that I could use when I came to knock on their door later that was all in the bushes.\"],[\"In my dream I was meeting with a man who was supposed to be a hands on healer but he was also creepy and I was trying to avoid him. He was going around visiting people and I was hiding from him in the bathroom. It was dark. We were near an ocean. Covid was happening or still happening because of masks and I was worried about people being too close.\"],[\"Half or full asleep - not sure - open door, shadows almost like visions of trucks going by, marching. All grey and green.\"],[\"A white room. My ex Rory was outside the door and I was inside. I was creating art or something on the floor. I had pot that was spilling everywhere and red wine, but I didn\\u2019t want him to see it. There was another part to the dream where we were in a house and having sex with each other but by extension with other people in other rooms but it wasn\\u2019t a graphic or sexual even. It was matter of fact. I could be where I was and be experiencing what they were experiencing. I was just experiencing people. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it.\"],[\"I was me I think and I was with a group of other people I\\u2019ve never met. We were at a store of some kind, maybe a children\\u2019s store and people were not wearing masks. Something happened: one of the men was bad and he got injured. He tried to take me and run away but I ran with another woman and I didn\\u2019t quite trust her either. We were suddenly driving at night on the streets where I grew up (kinda) and all the kids were camped out in tents on the football and soccer fields at night and only some of them were wearing masks.\"],[\"I\\u2019m climbing stairs with a colleague and other healthcare workers helping out somewhere. We\\u2019re trying to find space for our belongings and all the spaces were claimed. There were these symbols that looked like circles and guitars but not quite guitars, like Picasso guitars. There was another symbol that looked like a Scorpio sign or something almost like the prince symbol with a spade. We could not find any unclaimed area to even put one water bottle. I was frustrated but we finally found a spot to put our things after what felt like forever so we could get to work.\"],[\"I was with my older sister and she was somehow newly famous. She was going to give a concert or something and we were driving ourselves to each location. When we arrived, people were trying to sign her dress and we needed to go to the bathroom and change into jeans. In the first place, everything went smoothly. The second stop on the tour was someplace in California. We got there and she was changing in the bathroom. She was really short with me and I was basically her assistant. Then we went upstairs. It was like a bed-and-breakfast/ hotel/ concert venue. We looked out the window and we saw all these tiny little people. They looked like tiny little aliens but they were children and we realized it was a sweatshop next door. The children are comforting each other and there is an American flag there. It made me sick to my stomach and I kept wondering how we were going to help them and it was really upsetting. We were trying to figure out if we could call the police or call somebody to come in stay at that room so they could see what we are seeing and help these children because we know if we went to just go rescue them we could make it worse\"],[\"I was with my friend from South Africa and either one of her friends or a guide and we were climbing around these Crystal caves. There was no gravity or sense of space because I was sideways and upside down and at one point I was worried I was going to fall through. They put something underneath me to hold me but there was something really powerful about the crystals I was holding onto. It was also dangerous. They were amethyst maybe.\"],[\"I have no idea where this dream came from but it was attached to the end of the crystal dream where somebody was showing us their teeth and they had inserted Christmas lights and got tube lights to go on their teeth. We were saying that this wouldn\\u2019t stand the test of time but someday they would be sorry that they did this.\"],[\"Two scenes where there was a neighborhood restaurant or group of restaurants and we needed goggles and masks to go in and some cost extra money. There was a seafood place that you could hear and see from there with weird old time music playing and red checkered stuff everywhere. I don\\u2019t know if it was this same dream or not but I was with my ex Rory and other guys showed up as part of our group or nearby. One of them, after much time, angrily came up to Rory and said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t give her any affection, dude what is wrong with you!\\u201d He was vitriolic and I tried to calm him down but he stormed off.\"],[\"I was driving home and there were these huge parking structures and we all had to wait in our cars in order to go down and up these ramps. There were a lot of tiny sports cars and the ramps were designed so you could go fast or slow down the ramps. I went slow down the fast ramp.\"],[\"I was visiting Aidan, my friend from high school, and I think staying there while visiting the jail. She had this huge kitchen with all of these desserts lined up and organized for a party she was having for her kids. I tried to help pass out birdhouses but they were all wrong hanging from broken hooks. My younger sister Sarah was there and I was going to give her a cabbage patch one because she wouldn\\u2019t have had that in her age group growing up younger, but I got chastised for it. Not sure by who. It was dark. So many desserts. I went to get something out of my bag and my cash was soaking wet because something spilled on it and Aidan said I could pay her for my kids and I was like, \\u201cmy kids?\\u201d I guess she had been watching my kids in the dream all weekend while I did this other thing. I also paid the police people.\"],[\"There was a bright but soft golden glowing light coming and radiating but almost like floating into my apartment lighting up all the dark corners. It felt peaceful. Then I woke up and really had to pee!\"],[\"I was with someone I knew, maybe a friend or sister and we were sitting down and going to take a picture of ourselves, but no matter what I did I couldn't get the selfie thing right.\"],[\"I was in some kind of bad relationship and they wanted to keep me away from this guy and he was in jail maybe? I was with 2-3 other people, maybe peers like sisters or friends and we went to visit a museum and then were in the parking lot and I took them to the gift shop. I made several passes through with different people finding different little items. The last time I went I found this wall to wall display of weird ass flamingo pictures like twelve pictures arranged in rows. There were wall to wall crazy pictures of them walking and they looked ANGRY like if a flamingo could walk with arms/feathers around them and stalk and sulk. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me. I was a woman with a family and we had a garden and land and a greenhouse and neighbors. I had a little boy. It was green gray outside. We were watering the garden and there was a sonic BOOM and all of a sudden we could not water or share with our neighbors over the fence. It had stopped the water from being shared. Another part of the dream: Hooded people came. They were shooting at unarmed people in the neighborhood who were just gardening- boom boom! It looked like they were holding hoses but they were guns.\"],[\"My ex Rory and I are at some kind of party and there is all this fake jewelry and donated supplies for self care. I had already looked through it and realized some of it I donated last year (but in real life I\\u2019ve never seen before). It was time to go and I realized he had pimples to pop on his face that looked strange and they were like brown poop. It was so weird but he let me pop them (also not reality based) and they were full of brown squishy material. They were huge and on the side of his face. It was like that pimple popper show - haven\\u2019t seen it in years - but a satisfying feeling like that and also gross. It looked like poop.\"],[\"Images: Elevator. Parking garage and tip. Something else. Ram Dass\\u2019 face on a white board at work, and then lights out and his face on a candle. Wings on the ground.\"],[\"In my dream I woke up and I was in my apartment but it was the inverse layout and the lights were on. There was nothing on the walls, except there was this strange out of place headless glass bust on top of the TV. It was so out of place. I went to get water and felt like someone was there and things started falling out of the water tray but they were words and ideas not water. Later in this dream a PT I work with called to ask how to get her driver\\u2019s license and I consulted with Rory for some reason and I was annoyed by this. She said she was running late but on her way. I kept thinking, \\u201cWhere are we going and she needs to quarantine!\\u201d\"],[\"I went to a hipster cafe or something with my late husband Caleb but somehow also my ex Rory\\u2019s energy was there. He was impatient to order and he got his food ahead of me. It was 1300 when he ordered and got food and went to eat without me. I was waiting in line to order and then when it was my turn I didn\\u2019t know what I wanted and the people in line were upset and I got out of the way. When I finally ordered it was just a piece of cheese on bread, nothing else was appealing. I was worried about something the whole time like that he was mad at me or somehow this was my fault it was taking so long. Then he came back at the end and said, \\u201cI\\u2019m still waiting for you.\\u201d It looked like Caleb but the energy made me nervous and scared - more ex boyfriend Rory energy.\"],[\"I was at Esalen for something but there were lots of families staying there. We were kind of in pods away from others but I didn\\u2019t have a pod, it was just me and some other people who were way younger than me. At some point in the dream I got drunk on red wine, it was overflowing from a plastic margarita cup (I have no reference point for this) but I had just hooked up with a cute young guy (also totally out of character- the whole scene actually pretty ego dystonic for me). Later in that dream or a new dream, I was working on something and someone kept asking me to bring mural supplies to make a giant sign. They wanted this one kid to work on it and this annoyed me. I don\\u2019t know why maybe because someone was telling me what to do?\"],[\"I was with my sisters and my mom or a woman who represented my mom (who passed away when I was 20). We were like a group of Thelma and Louise type characters running from town to town and we were getting chased by police, there was even a water chase scene on jet skis. Then I woke up.\"],[\"Wandering around an older town \\u201cBirmingham\\u201d or something like that with rustic wood and cobblestone streets. My cell battery was 1% the whole time and I was trying to connect or find someone with a predetermined meeting. Later Patient C and my grandparents' old house in Virginia. I was trying to charge the phone and he took it from me and laughed but it wasn\\u2019t mean, it was playful. There was some kind of party but nobody was there.\"],[\"I was with Rory somewhere and we were sleeping in separate bedrooms but he kept sleepwalking in the middle of the night and then checking his hands when he would come home.\"],[\"It was dark icy blue kind of dark and I was in a room that was large and new to me, I was hiding from people and went from window to window making sure the blinds were closed and the deadbolt on the door was locked. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my friend Emily and she was pouring champagne into glasses and she had some pre-poured in her cupboard! However she drank first and then gave me one but it was a large round cup. I was disappointed it wasn\\u2019t a champagne flute but didn\\u2019t say anything. She said I could stay and watch a movie if I was lonely. I explained that I tried reaching my sisters but that they were busy. In my dream I saw an image of my sister Anne and her family dressed up like fancy Santa and elves and they were doing a family photo shoot and kind of snobbish. Then I went back to my other dream.\"],[\"I was taking a car to a parking lot that was also inside of a house. There were young black valets and I think they thought I was a \\u201cKaren.\\u201d I wanted them to know I wasn\\u2019t. I got out and went inside this house and it was HUGE and super nice and somehow mine. Not a reality for me. It had wide stairs but in order to go up, I had to go down and it was frustrating. When I finally got upstairs an alarm went off so I turned around to go downstairs and had to go up before I could go down! Then I woke up. The stairs were like pool table green with big mahogany bannisters.\"],[\"I was getting ready for work and a colleague was with her family showing up by the telephone pole in a neighborhood and her brother was like, \\u201chey I know you,\\u201d and it made me want to run away.\"],[\"My dream was a young black girl trying to enter my balcony. She looked at me in the eye and wanted something from me.\"],[\"I was renting a house for Christmas or beyond and I had my own decorations and furniture as well as the ones that were there. My sister Sarah arrived and was trying to help but was annoying me. She was asking if I did this or that and I just wanted to be left alone. I had a long handled lighter for a candle and couldn\\u2019t get it to work and it broke and was leaking fluid everywhere. Then I woke up annoyed.\"],[\"I was with my ex Rory, and we were traveling somewhere like doing a condo or a timeshare or something. When we got inside we were trying to close the blinds and they fell off and he was like, \\u201coh this happened when I was here before,\\u201d and I was like, \\u201coh that\\u2019s annoying.\\u201d The people who worked there were sitting outside looking through the window and not helpful at all, just rolling their eyes. He had shared that he\\u2019d been there before with his late wife and I was like, \\u201coh where are we?\\u201d and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was at work and I was there on a day off rushing to finish. I went to go do my charting and I sat down to listen. There\\u2019s water rushing up from the floor and I want to go save things off the floor and there was an extra computer on the chair.\"],[\"I was on the elevator with some work colleagues, but it was an elevator sometimes and like a subway. It looked like a big, sterile elevator sometimes but then at other times it looked like we are on this underground train that was white with everything silver around very sterile. We kept getting stuck and we couldn\\u2019t figure out how to get on and off of it. Somebody came to call out for us; it was this lady we work with and she was actually trying to keep us on it instead of getting us off it. Nobody knew the password. There was like this code to put in 3711 or something to help us get off and everybody was debating how to do it the right way. Somebody said that we\\u2019d all been in this situation before and we would figure it out everybody had their own way but nothing was working and then I woke up.\"],[\"We were at a big holiday party for work but at somebody\\u2019s house. There were maybe ten of us and it was all decorated for the holidays. We were celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah in the new year. Someone came that wasn\\u2019t supposed to come and started murdering all the Jewish people. It was really upsetting having people with guns. Then fast forward, I was at the same location and we were doing a world service. I sat in the front room with one of the attendings, Dr. Donovan. It was just three people in the front row -nher and me and somebody else on the left-hand side. I was scared and they were speaking another language.\"],[\"I was with my family and some extended family on my dad\\u2019s side. It was dark and we were going to a big football game. I was nervous about it and I wasn\\u2019t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn\\u2019t like him. I knew that it wasn\\u2019t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design. Everybody was commenting on how fast it was for the game but I was really nervous about going somewhere in public.\"],[\"Airbnb. Conference. A short fat white trans woman with a beehive wig tried to take my cab then shared with a shorter round man with brown hair, khaki suit. He hailed the same time for the taxi that I was taking to the next hotel. I could\\u2019ve walked but was in pain. It felt like was picking up on dreams that were not mine\"],[\"I was walking along a main street where everything was fucked up from water damage and my friend Emily had a shop that I didn\\u2019t know she had until then and it was ruined but it was like a paper shop and she needed to place these big bottles in front of the machines.\"],[\"There was another dream about something where I didn\\u2019t feel good and I left to go get a soft pretzel snack from a concession stand somewhere.\"],[\"I woke up in another dream where I was recovering at a house but the house was for sale, so I had to make it presentable. I\\u2019m trying to remember the details on this but I was also watching the interactions between a couple. There was a man and a woman who were together and he was trying to make friends with all of the single women at the party and make plans to see them and his wife was like, \\u201cdude take a break!\\u201d\"],[\"Then I had another dream where I was visiting. I think I was back home in Virginia and I needed to crash somewhere and I don\\u2019t know who the friend was but he was explaining to me that his relatives had this townhouse. They had just gotten it as a deal because the owner had died by suicide in the closet. Actually now that I\\u2019m thinking about it, it was my ex Rory and the people that live there were his mom and his stepdad, but it wasn\\u2019t them - it was definitely not them really - it was just like his mom\\u2018s voice was the lady. In any case the place was a disaster. There was food all over the floor and it was really unkempt with stains everywhere. They kept saying that the middle level of the townhouse was cold and that\\u2019s where the person had died by suicide in the closet. They kept making references to it like it was spooky and it just made me sad for the person that had been there before. It looked like the street I grew up in Virginia but it was townhouses instead of small houses. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was part of this elite group of athletes or team of race car drivers. We were all working out on mats lined up 3x2 facing each other. Then it was almost like the matrix; we were strapped into seats and I could see the tops of the cars and race track all black and blue and purple, almost animated looking. Someone went too far and made an illegal move and crashed. We were about to start an investigation when I woke up. I was with my best friend Aidan growing up - we barely keep in touch now. Anyways I was with her and we were at a place that was supposed to be my work now and getting ready for a sleepover. We saw Arshis and some of his family, so invited them. It was very platonic, matter of fact like, \\u201cwe are having this get together would you like to come?\\u201d\"],[\"I was at this rapper's house, a famous one, maybe P. Diddy, and we\\u2019re having this party. They took us out back to this private ocean. I went into the ocean and it was murky but he said that there were these reeds in it and even though they seemed weird because he would feel them underneath and they actually lifted you up. So we went into the water and music came on and at first I was going around with this guy - I don\\u2019t know who he was - and he wanted me to follow him but I didn\\u2019t. I just went my own way and the more I went my own way the more I twirled and the more Power I felt through my legs. It was incredible and I was climbing over the reeds and slithering but even that was powerful and I realize that the reeds were there to protect us and lift us up as well. I was unstoppable. I was just twirling and dancing and I was like a ballerina and Ballin\\u2019 and it was so lovely and so beautiful I never wanted to wake up from that.\"],[\"I was with somebody like a female friend, but I don\\u2019t really remember who. We were walking from somewhere together and there were all these steep hills one after the other. All of a sudden it was snowing and icy and we were really careful going down these really steep hills and talking about how they would gather speed. Then these people came up behind us and they\\u2019re kind of like these hicks. We overheard them saying things like, \\u201ccan you walk Jonas? Look at us.\\u201d I stopped to get these dollar deals on the side of the road and they had these weird covers and I was looking for them everywhere but they only had one pair. There was something that I had to talk to this other friend about before; it was weird. The roadside stand had all kinds of old travel gadgets.\"],[\"I was on this moving platform of things and my dad was there. I was embarrassed by him because there were other people I knew from work, like attendings etc.\"],[\"The last dream I had was more like a general dream I was with a bunch of other people I don\\u2019t really know in real life.

We were going to go up on stage and get our picture taken\"],[\"I was a younger black teenager and I challenged my older brother to a fight and I knocked myself out into the wall. I was narrating like a movie.\"],[\"I was riding along as a passenger in an old beat up pick up truck. We stopped at this old town and got out. We walked inside this tiny little gift shop and it was like walking in circles. I couldn\\u2019t fit anywhere, it was like a doll house. There were boxes all over the floor and I kept thinking, \\u201cthis is not ADA compliant.\\u201d\"],[\"I was at work and my colleague erased my quote from the board...I wasn\\u2019t mad I was just confused\"],[\"I was moving out of a room or suite from my best friend Aidan\\u2019s house and she was helping me move. We have packed up all the boxes and are making sure we have everything. There are all these clear containers. Then I was getting dressed and she was carrying everything down faster than I could. When we walked out her mom was lounging around outside and there were all these stairs, lots and lots of stairs. I said a joke about how she was a Sherpa and it was really funny. Then Aidan and I went out somewhere and it was during the pandemic but we were in high school like we were when we were best friends and yet we were both wearing our work clothes for some reason and my badge had University Health care. It was hard to see and it said 9 to 5 and we went into this police station or Fireman's gym and they really go \\u201c95\\u201d like it was the call number for a place that they knew. I was embarrassed to tell them it was a particular university, but 925 meant something in the dream.\"],[\"I was in a yoga studio and crammed in trying to go to class and I couldn\\u2019t see the teacher and I was annoyed at the people around me because they were acting really immature.\"],[\"This dream was probably based on the movie I saw tonight before I went to bed: something about the vast of night.

The second time it flooded she was just out of the shower and I told her it was flooding and she panicked and told me to flip the switches and I couldn\\u2019t find them but I went around spraying the spray she told me to use. It was dark and there were a lot of staircases and rooms and children\\u2019s play stuff but the whole house was empty.

Went up the escalator and the door at the top was closed and we all were getting jammed at the top.\"],[\"Last night I dreamt that the new iPhone came out and it was like a retro flip phone and I felt cheated by it I mean I bought it I think I had one in my hand and my husband had one and we\\u2019re at a party and somebody else had one and actually this guy took his out put it on the table and then when he did I thought oh my gosh what is that old flip phone and then I remembered that I had one so I reached into my pocket and I pulled it out and I was kind of messing with it and my husband took his out and said merry Christmas or whatever so I guess he had surprised me with it and I was really underwhelmed I was disappointed and it was a weird feeling to be disappointed I felt really shallow and petty observing my feelings about this inanimate object.\"],[\"At my childhood home there is a family reunion from a few families that are important to me. (In waking life I don\\u2019t know these families). A friend John who is in love with me invited his family to meet me, but I am married. He introduces me to the room of people and says we have a lot of history and I balk because it implies something romantic that never was. (In real life he was a high school crush and a pen pal after he moved away). I feel embarrassed and want to confront him but not humiliate him. I wander around and mingle with guests and don\\u2019t confront the friend. I fly to China for the marathon but leave mid way through to Iceland airwaves and to do a kayak trip around the island. I don\\u2019t finish the race either. I go to my favorite shop in Iceland and there\\u2019s a t-shirt that says we\\u2019re having a baby and it\\u2019s a picture of a tiger and a bird and the baby is a monkey. I go to lunch and my best friend Bea is there and we embrace. (In waking life we recently had a falling out). I tell her I sold the business and that I got invited to join a matchmaking service but I\\u2019m married so I don\\u2019t want to go. I panic about getting home and also back to China to finish work because I bought a one way ticket. I call to stay with a friend Julia (who I also had an argument with last year and want to patch things up). Julia picks me up and she tells me she finished the half marathon and she is in recovery from it still.\"],[\"I was on a cruise or some kind of family summer camp and had played a few rounds of an interactive scavenger hunt - I think something active maybe paintball and I sat down at a table with a family that I know and then there was a family that I didn\\u2019t know. The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn\\u2019t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I\\u2019ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn\\u2019t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn\\u2019t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn\\u2019t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn\\u2019t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.\"],[\"I was in a tiny house with my husband that was glass (or mostly glass: had a lot of windows). And there was a HUGE dog outside with a cat on its back and they were running around the house. Then three wolves came and everyone was running around us. We weren\\u2019t that scared but maybe a little. Mostly excited about the cat riding the dog.\"],[\"There was a stranger squatting in the guest house on the far end of my property. The guest house was a little dilapidated and needed lots of work. But there were three beautiful white Lily bushes growing outside of it. It\\u2019s a house I\\u2019ve seen before in a dream. I knew the guy was there but I couldn\\u2019t explain how I knew, I just felt it. No one believed me. I went out one day to confirm my suspicions. I saw the reflection in the window of someone behind me and I turned and no one was there. A tall cowboy western looking guy in a blue flannel. I looked in the window and saw him again and when I turned around he was there with his wife and daughter and they walked away together really floaty and turned around to look at me once. They were ghosts. I was nervous but I went into the house and I saw someone sleeping. I got scared and ran all the way home and he was running behind me. I got inside and closed the door and he stood there begging to talk. So I talked to him and he was actually really nice and asked if he could help fix it up in exchange for living there for a year. I thought that seemed fair. He had a job and was saving all his money to marry his girlfriend. I agreed but didn\\u2019t tell anyone that lived with me about the arrangements. I went out to the pool and my kitties were swimming in it. There was a baby pony near the pool. I swam with the kitties. There was a swing set on the hill above the pool. And there was an eerie feeling about it. My niece was playing on it. I called her over to swim with the kitties and to look at the pony. I don\\u2019t think she listened.\"],[\"Dreamt I was in a very strange house. It looked like a cheap Korean spa\\u2014beautiful materials were used like jade flooring but it was damp and the floor uneven and I had vertigo. I had invited my mom and sister and niece to live with me. There was a noise in the downstairs portion of the house and it was a child that was completely deranged/a monster really. It had a gun and was shooting at us. I got a gun and I was fumbling with it, I was so scared! I dropped it and it rolled down the floor (very sloped uneven floor). I ran to it and tripped and almost had it when the monster was standing over me with the gun. I shouted \\u201cbehind you!!\\u201d And the baby turned and shot my mom! I felt so guilty it was my fault I ran to her and the baby was still shooting. I got the gun and shot it. It rolled very gruesomely all the way down the uneven floor to the door and down the stairs. It was horrific and bloody. And my mom and this random monster baby were dead and I had to do something but I knew no one would believe what happened! I had to make up a lie blaming my mom for it all. I didn\\u2019t want to do it and I forced myself awake.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room. The paint on the walls was old and chipping and the carpet was raggedy. I gave her some art and she loved it but wanted to take it somewhere to be finished. I was visiting a hotel and I couldn\\u2019t afford to stay there, I was waiting for a friend that had a room key. Staff kind of found me locked in the hallway with posters, I was staging a protest the following day. I had a million bags and posters and markers and nothing was organized. I felt really flustered. There was a family of 8 that needed help figuring out how to get jobs and who was old enough to work and I couldn\\u2019t figure out what they should do.\"],[\"I lived a whole life in my dream last night. This is a love story, though not a waking life idea of a love story. Traveling through Asia as a college kid, following in with an anarchist gang and getting into a lot of trouble. Fleeing a penitentiary sentence I escaped to an island and found my true love. He didn\\u2019t believe in marriage or monogamy and I found space to allow his love in my life and not have it be the center of my life. I accepted his conditions. I raised our child kind of solo with him in and out for long periods of time. He ran a hostel on the beach which is where I met him. There was never a sentiment of hate or resentment. At some point I decided to leave the island with my kid and travel back to the states and settled down there for a while. When the child grew up I returned to my nomadic Ways and wandered back to the island. There were no phones or anything like that but I found my love at the hostel and we settled in together there until he died. This dream spanned from age 18 to 70. I was grateful for what I had. I didn\\u2019t control or expect anything, which is weird, because it is not how I am in waking life. I woke up missing him. I accepted a lot of limitations, particularly with my lover, and surrendered to it - having a beautiful life with and without him. I chose love over what I thought was due to me.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room. The paint on the walls was old and chipping and the carpet was raggedy.

Mom dad adult son. Immigrant family, maybe Persian? In an urban setting. The son is seen (even by me initially as the viewer) as short chubby and lazy who drains resources and who relies on his parents. In reality he is extremely depressed and unhealthy and needs help with his life. He works at a company for 10 years for 2 hours a day. He has 2 friends. Me as an omniscient character and this other guy he works with who got him the job. Both of us childhood friends. Then there\\u2019s a girl from work and at the company party ends up sleeping with G, wakes up in his loft which is super nice. Then while getting coffee, meets his parents and is startled that he lives with his mom.\"],[\"I was almost like trapped in a housing complex. Where every house was the same. I was supposed to sell the houses to new members of the community. It was all brown people from different ethnic backgrounds. I was taught how to do the job but I wasn\\u2019t doing it well. There was this Beautiful man, Naveen Andrews, that lives there and he was helping me get acclimated. There were seminars every day in the courtyard. Everyone was so calm and collected and moved so gracefully. I didn\\u2019t. My stuff was everywhere. My motorcycle was in the middle of the impeccably landscaped garden and I had to move it out during a seminar and it was so distracting and noisy and awkward. I had my first tour I was giving and I had all the paperwork for each person and they all were completely different but I could only remember one name and I kept calling them all the same name, Sheera. I was so embarrassed. I sold one house to one of the people who was In love with Naveen. She also hated me for being so close with him.\"],[\"I become instantly aware of needing to be at a precise location at a specific time and do a specific task. I do it and it doesn\\u2019t seem like much. I arrive at my final exam presentation and instead of speaking, I need to dance to a specific song. It\\u2019s a dramatic ballet. After the performance, I become aware that I have just shaped the future/changed the future. I receive awareness/communication within myself that I have changed the course of history by this act, a classmate is forever changed by the dance and is influenced by art instead and he no longer becomes an evil politician but rather a philanthropist of the arts. It happened again, I was to meet at a bar at a hotel and talk to someone sitting there. I did. We talked about how I was so depressed but then got help and it changed the way I interacted with my own trauma. I gave him the number of my therapist and I became aware that instead of suicide bombing the town at the end of the year, this man I spoke to would fall in love at the end of the year. I started following all of these instincts, knowing I was shaping a better future through small acts of kindness, love, passion, art. It became all consuming. I saw someone having a conversation and I became aware that they were receiving the same kind of transmissions as I had been. I kind of kept an eye on them and eventually they asked if I was following them. I asked why they were doing the things they were doing and eventually we realized we were on the same mission. Soon, we had formed a whole community of receivers. We had meetings and at one meeting I remember bringing the issue to the table that my old self and motivations and trajectories were so changed, like I had died and replaced by prescience. I still had my own memories from before but I was sharing my self and body with this prescience that had nothing to do with me as my own person. We didn\\u2019t find a solution but we did mourn and grieve our lives and tried to find ways to remember and be ourselves.\"],[\"Old style cottage farmhouse. No barn. Half underground. A gathering of farmers. And then there was me, a researcher. I take over research from my predecessor. No talk of who that was or where they left off or where I was to start. Joyous and also conspiratory. Conversations hushed when I\\u2019d come in. There was something everyone knew that I didn\\u2019t. No one was unwelcoming or overly welcoming but something was amiss. Something subtle. There was a small Market across the street, the only place to get food but we were a farm so it was confusing. What were we farming? I remember wondering why there wasn\\u2019t a barn and asking about it. I was in a place of questioning everything, a feeling of excitement and also of distrust. There was a knowing that my aunt's house was close and that I\\u2019d grown up seeing the farmhouse. The overall feeling of the dream was eerie, even if the actual events weren\\u2019t blatantly so.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a house and step out into the backyard to join a small group of 2 or 3 people. We\\u2019re standing in the grass and see that someone has spread out a huge white blanket over the lawn. In the middle of the blanket is a big pile of dog shit, and I\\u2019m like, what\\u2019s this?! We share this backyard with neighbors that live in the house behind us. So I decide to go over and see if I can find one of the neighbors. One of them is a guy in his late twenties. He\\u2019s sitting in a makeshift house, like a playhouse for kids, really simple with just cutouts for doors and windows and nothing else really. He\\u2019s sitting inside with his didgeridoo and his flute and he says yeah, the dog had a stomach upset and has been shitting all day, but he doesn\\u2019t volunteer to help clean up. I don\\u2019t recall how I respond, but I end up leaving and walking back to the house. As I do this, I step in a pile of liquidy dog poop. I don\\u2019t have any shoes on and I can feel that liquidy shit on the sole of my left foot. Then I see that somebody has pushed the blanket together towards the middle but the poop is still there in the center, so that has to be taken care of. I walk back inside. My mom is upstairs in the bathroom. I go into the kitchen and Mary is there. She offers me this saline mister spray with medicinal properties for your food. So I spray my food but I\\u2019m not sure that it gets into the food because it is misting into the air. Then she is pushing a little black pill up into my left nostril. I don\\u2019t know what it is, but I trust her. For a moment I wonder if it is some kind of drug that will send me on a weird trip? But, then I know that it is herbs based on a healing tea that will help me breathe easier. Right then, my son wakes me up, but I can still feel that I can breathe easily through my left nostril.\"],[\"Construction on the inside of a building. Wooden boards being installed in the roof, each have been inscribed with the artist\\u2019s name: Grower. The \\u201cW\\u201d is in the shape of an owl.\"],[\"I am with a group of sisters and we\\u2019re all standing on yoga mats but we\\u2019re not doing yoga. I have taken off my adornments and placed them at the top of the mat and they\\u2019re almost in Ursula's in space, so she gives me this look and so I in a really apologetic way move them over to the side and hide away in a bit of shame for that. Again I\\u2019m not able to stand in my true power and be myself in her presence. There's a direction from somewhere, someone telling us to remove our clothes. We are all wearing these beautiful silk flowing gowns. Nobody moves at first. It\\u2019s an odd direction and we don\\u2019t know where it\\u2019s coming from. Then Ursula who is across from me on a mat steps forward in this really seductive way starts to slip off her dress. Two women on either side who are studying with her are her attendants and they help her remove her gown and all of her underthings. Then everyone else proceeds to do so. I feel like, oh gosh I have to also and so I remove my outer gown, but I keep on my underwear because I haven\\u2019t waxed and I\\u2019m feeling pretty shameful about that. So I\\u2019m left wearing a black thong. Then I\\u2019m in a room and one of my husband\\u2019s friends is lying on a couch. He\\u2019s 7 feet tall - a really big guy - and he\\u2019s kind of joking around. He says something that agitates me. I climb up onto him and start to pound on him in a playful way. And I say, \\u201cYou know I never really do this with anybody else, but you\\u2019re so big and it just seems okay to do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s laughing and he thinks it\\u2019s a funny thing, too. Then I\\u2019m in a building and I\\u2019m talking to this very wealthy man - a billionaire, creative person who I don\\u2019t know in waking life. My husband\\u2019s friend in the previous scene is also a very wealthy man. He\\u2019s talking about his vision for what he wants to create and bring me along with it. We are in a glass skyscraper type building and we see King Kong. King Kong is smashing buildings and it seems like he\\u2019s looking for this guy I\\u2019m with. He sees us through the window and comes toward us. We\\u2019re frantically trying to run away - run up the stairs or run down the stairs and get out of the building. And the building is crashing around us. I run downstairs into a hallway and I see an arrow pointing to a sign with a name - Beth. Beth is a friend of mine in town - she\\u2019s a counselor. So I see an arrow to her house and I run to find her. She\\u2019s there and she walks with me to the top of the stairs. She stays with my son in a stroller at the top of the stairs. I run down the stairs. I have to go to the bathroom. I end up in this Japanese style bathroom with all these automatic toilets that I have lights and sing songs. You\\u2019re supposed to go to the bathroom in a particular way and push the right buttons so it cleans you in a particular way. So I do, but just as I\\u2019m finishing up, a whole group of photographers are standing right outside the door. They walk in and I\\u2019m not fully dressed again. I\\u2019m feeling ashamed of being caught with my pants down.\"],[\"I am with a small group of people and we are climbing up a very steep rock. We get to a point where the rock opens up and you can see down into a deep crevice, but you can\\u2019t see the bottom because it\\u2019s so deep. Most of us have made it across. One woman who was an acquaintance from middle school, Anne, is there. She\\u2019s stretching her leg out to get across the black hole and she doesn\\u2019t make it. We all watch her horrified, seeing her fall and fall until we can\\u2019t see her. Then we hear some flapping and a bird/woman has caught her and is lifting her up from the depths.\"],[\"I see an absolutely gorgeous man and decide that he will be my lover. He is perfectly shaped and poised. I am deeply attracted to him. He reminds me of the first man I fell in love with nearly 20 years ago. I\\u2019m semi-lucid and keep rearranging the scenes, repeating moments to get them just right and perfect so I can be with him. In one of the scenes, we are in a big room with many beds of all different sizes. He has one bed and the other beds are for others. I somehow make all the beds shift over to one side of the room. My intention is to have our bed separate from the others. Then I look over and see him sitting next to me on a bench. We\\u2019re on the same side of the room with the cluster of beds all pushed up next to each other. The other side of the room is empty and it feels unbalanced. So I erase the scene and start all over again. There are other scenes I can\\u2019t recall. Now we are in a grassy field like a baseball field - this is the last one. I go up to him and brush my lips against his skin. He\\u2019s not wearing a shirt. I indicate that I am interested and wanting more even though I\\u2019m married. I love the warmth and heat of being so close to him.\"],[\"I am walking on a sidewalk with my husband and see a pile of packages ready to be mailed. They\\u2019re addressed to our parents and from our friend Sherry. I think it\\u2019s such a nice gesture that she bought presents for our parents and we didn\\u2019t even think to. We see that one package is not fully wrapped. It\\u2019s a cake and waffles. We nibble the waffles and love them! We eat around the perimeter and hope it doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019ve been snacking on their gift. Then I\\u2019m with my husband and his family - dad, step-mom and step-sisters. We\\u2019re standing in a circle and they are passing around the beautiful cake that Sherry sent. They cut different sized slices and Krista takes an extra large slice - it\\u2019s so big there isn\\u2019t enough for everyone. Either I or my son grab the cake from her and start to eat. She\\u2019s upset, but the rest of the group says \\u201cno, they need cake, too.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful cake with orange frosting, different layers and textures. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in the same room, but it\\u2019s later in the day. I\\u2019m alone with my son. My husband\\u2019s dad walks in but he looks like a zombie, as if he\\u2019s been in a car accident. He\\u2019s completely bald and white pale and his face is streaming with blood. Then a younger version of my husband\\u2019s dad comes in with blood streaming down his face, too.\"],[\"My husband is teaching a class, but the attendees are all potted plants in plastic NICU incubators. Then I\\u2019m in a big hotel. My husband has engaged the services of a male escort. He\\u2019s really looking forward to this man because he\\u2019s a very good kisser. But the man\\u2019s body is so distorted - he\\u2019s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I\\u2019m not happy about the situation but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He\\u2019s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we\\u2019re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I\\u2019m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it\\u2019s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can\\u2019t recall much more. Then we\\u2019re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter. I\\u2019m really upset that he\\u2019s breathing on me and that these people walked into our dining room obviously sick and just off a plane or boat. The scene shifts. I\\u2019m outside walking along a marina. There is shallow water with rocks like tidepools. I look down into the water and see two black and white cats curled together in a circle. They are all wet. I think it\\u2019s odd that the cats are so pleasantly sleeping floating on the water. I keep walking and see a couple drenched yellow chicks. I wonder if they\\u2019ve drowned or if they\\u2019re also sleeping. Then I see a turkey struggling on its back in the water between rocks. I see pigs doing the same along with some other animals. It\\u2019s a very odd scene.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we\\u2019re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I\\u2019m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I\\u2019m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That\\u2019s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I\\u2019m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There\\u2019s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I\\u2019m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, \\u201cI was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.\\u201d She lists the women, but I don\\u2019t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it\\u2019s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don\\u2019t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It\\u2019s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He\\u2019s playing with the water from the fridge. He\\u2019s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I\\u2019m concerned that I don\\u2019t have anyone to take care of him and that he\\u2019s disturbing the session. But my client doesn\\u2019t seem to notice or care that he\\u2019s interfering.\"],[\"I have tickets to go to a show and the show is tonight. Before going to the show, I go to a bar and meet up with some friends. Then I go back to the house - it\\u2019s a communal house that I share with a lot of different people. I decide to go to the show. I stop at a health/art fair. People are getting their hair and makeup done, and I wait to have mine done, too. I wander around looking at art. There are huge beautiful pieces and odd pieces. People are wandering around looking, too. Then I look at the time and I realize I need to get the show. It\\u2019s 11pm but still twilight. I realize I am too late for the show.\"],[\"I am at a building that appears to be an unemployment office, though it\\u2019s more of a nice community center and rest stop along a highway. I\\u2019m filing for unemployment and looking for support. While I\\u2019m inside, I look out the window at my car. My car is a convertible and the top is off. A man is sitting in the passenger seat. He\\u2019s scruffy and older looking of mixed ethnicity - at one point he seems Chinese and another African. I make a move towards the car to tell him to get out, but then he slides a gun across his lap and points it toward me. The gun is upside down and pointed at me as a warning to stay back. So I don't say anything to him. I go back inside and a woman notices that I\\u2019m disturbed. She asks me about it, but she can do nothing to help me. So I\\u2019m at a loss. The dream shifts to the next day at the same time. I\\u2019m waiting for help. He happens to be inside, too. The woman who I spoke with yesterday comes out and apologizes to me that we are here at the same time and that he could be near me. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it, it\\u2019s okay. He doesn\\u2019t seem to be threatening today.\\u201d I notice that he\\u2019s just standing there, leaning against a wall, trying to get help, too. Then I wander around. At the back, there is an outdoor patio and some of my friends are there. One of my friends suggests we have a glass of wine. So we go to order wine. There are so many choices, but no menu. So we have to guess and give words to the man serving the wine, describing the taste profile or experience we desire. He pulls out a bag of sarsaparilla and cloves and holds it open for us to smell. We enjoy the smell and he gives us a mason jar of red wine that has this flavor profile. While he\\u2019s serving us, he tells us that he used to have a job that paid $35/hour and he misses that regular pay because now he is just living on tips. We thank him and each pay him $5 for the wine and $1 tip. He says again, \\u201cI still wish I had that job where I was getting paid 35 a month.\\u201d I think, \\u201cHmm a month? Didn\\u2019t you see 35 an hour? 35 a month is not a lot.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say anything, though. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m walking through a building. It appears to be a school. It\\u2019s on complete lockdown and all the doors are bolted - some are bolted shut and others are locked partially open. The halls are completely empty. The rooms are emptying. I\\u2019m carrying a glass of red wine in my hand, peering into windows and rooms. As I\\u2019m walking down one hallway, a naked and very full woman is walking towards me with a swaddled baby. It appears she has just given birth. We nod at each other, but say nothing as we pass. She\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen so far. I turn left and am walking down a hallway. I peer through a doorway and see a woman dressed in black. She\\u2019s squatting as if giving birth, but she\\u2019s already given birth. Her baby is on the floor beside her. She is wailing and keening. The carpet under her mouth is soaking wet with tears, saliva and snot. She is retching and I can\\u2019t tell if she\\u2019s actually throwing up. I walk past and then turn back. Now this same room is full of mothers who have recently given birth. This is a support meeting for them being facilitated by my midwife. I go in but am embarrassed to have red wine and put it on the desk. I leave, but forget my wine. I go back, but can\\u2019t find it on the dresser where I had placed it. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a very nice house with a loft where I have been sleeping and resting. I climb down the ladder and see one of my roommates from freshman year of college. She tosses me a baby food pack of pureed vegetables. It\\u2019s nearly empty, but I\\u2019m grateful to even have that little bit. The car from earlier in the dream has now been given to my brother-in-law. Now he has two cars - one for work and the convertible for the weekend and picking up girls.\"],[\"A store after hours. It\\u2019s been closed for a while now. People are gathering here at night, unlocking the door and huddling close inside. Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I\\u2019m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I\\u2019m not really welcome because I\\u2019m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won\\u2019t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I\\u2019m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.\"],[\"I am a passenger in a vehicle of some kind, I think it\\u2019s a train. I\\u2019m with other people and we are looking for our home. It\\u2019s night outside. We\\u2019re going past some pick-yards filled with old smashed up cars. Then we end up at a huge mansion in this cute little town. We walk in because it is our new home. I am most impressed with the kitchen. I love it because there are three different sitting choices - a half moon table at the end of the island with a couple chairs; a longer rectangle dark wood table for 6; and a pretty shiny off-white round breakfast nook with soft pillows on the two benches. To the right of the kitchen is a big formal sitting room and dining area. The dining table is large and gleaming white. It only sits 4. The chairs have mossy soft green cushions and the place settings are lovely - silver and cream with gold, soft green napkins. There is a fireplace with antlers on the mantel. It\\u2019s very nice, elegant, cozy and inviting. Off to the side of this large room is a small library/consultation room. Later in the dream, my mom has returned from a trip into town. She has a towel wrapped around her head as if she\\u2019s just come out of the shower. She is having a counseling consultation with a woman. The house is surrounded by a lot of space. I\\u2019m walking with my friend and housemate (I don\\u2019t recognize her from waking life). She steps on a dry place with branches and fallen leaves. The ground gives way a bit and we look at each other, astonished, and I tell her: \\u201cKeep walking!\\u201d As she keeps carefully walking, the ground continues to give way and we see that it is a mote without any water in it. The mote was dug around this house many many years ago. We are astonished. We look at each other and remember: We\\u2019ve lived in this home in a past life. This house has always been in our family and it is right that we have returned. So we continue to walk, moving the ground away with our steps and remembering/revealing this mote. Now I have to go into town for an errand. I\\u2019m a passenger in a car. The town reminds me of the outer parts of San Francisco where I used to live. I\\u2019m going to meet people for ice cream. At first I just order a regular ice cream cone. But then I see that the other people have chosen a crispy cookie cone. When I look at theirs, I want it because mine is just this soggy flour burrito wrap. I ask for the crispy cookie cone and they look at the board to calculate the cost. My order comes with four layers and each cone is $3, so it will be an additional $12. I think that\\u2019s too expensive and just take the regular one. It\\u2019s not very appetizing and I don\\u2019t love it but I eat it anyway. Now I\\u2019m being driven back with a realtor and I look out to see the windmill - it has been lit up with white lights and is sparkling and beautiful against the night sky and dark ocean. The realtor points out that they had to take away all the historic sculptures from the beach because the big giant peach was cracked and needed to be renovated. So they decided to renovate all the pieces that used to be in the carnival at the beach. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s sad they had to take those away.\\u201d I look out the window to the left and see that a house has been torn down. But they\\u2019re building a new house out of bottle caps. I\\u2019m amazed at this bottle cap house. On the way back to the house, we see a wonderful field and imagine going there to play and eat lunch. I know it will be a wonderful place to live.\"],[\"\\u201cA Seaworthy Vessel\\u201d I have built a big raft for the ocean with a group of about 5. There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there\\u2019s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It\\u2019s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I\\u2019m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I\\u2019m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don\\u2019t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They\\u2019re all great and I love them all. I\\u2019m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don\\u2019t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I\\u2019m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I\\u2019m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he\\u2019s pointing out. It\\u2019s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I\\u2019m in a shop. It is Jeremy\\u2019s shop. It\\u2019s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It\\u2019s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race. So we set a trajectory...\"],[\"I didn\\u2019t want to remember this dream. I wanted to forget it. I woke feeling paralyzed by fear of being abandoned. I am lying in the back of a car with my husband. The seats have been folded down so we can lie flat. He is naked. I am wearing a sweatshirt, leggings and shoes. They aren\\u2019t real leggings because my pelvis is bare. I\\u2019m offering my body, but still holding back with reluctance. There is a coldness about him, his body saying, \\u201cNope, I\\u2019m done.\\u201d I feel fear, despair, total abandonment come over my whole body. In another scene I\\u2019m walking into a building with Jack. He is in waking life and in this dream, a relationship counselor. We walk in and look through the window of a door into a classroom. I see three men on yoga mats and a fourth teaching. In the next room, my husband is co-teaching with our friend, Sherry. There is a big group of people doing a practice involving rubbing their knuckles along their foreheads. I\\u2019m surprised there are so many people when they were only expecting a few. Jack tells me that the group next door was supposed to have a bigger class, but cut back to only 4, so the remaining people decided to take class with my husband and Sherry. It\\u2019s good to see my husband doing his thing and having success in his role as a teacher. Then in another scene, I\\u2019m at a wedding ceremony or vow renewal for my husband and me. When it comes time for me to kiss my husband again, he has a basket of papers and a basket of flowers. Other people are around. He pretends to draw me in, but rejects me, turning away at the time of the kiss. There is a sense that I\\u2019ve done something horribly wrong and he\\u2019s gone now. There is also a health fair that we were supposed to be in, but got cancelled.\"],[\"I am at a teahouse - it reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco. I\\u2019m enjoying tea with a man and looking at his hands to see if he is wearing a wedding band. I have a memory of walking and talking with him and seeing a wedding ring. Now, his left ring finger is bare and his right ring finger has a silver band. Then I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walk in and am so disgusted. There is diarrhea all over the floor and big sticky gobs of shit everywhere - toilet seat and floor - and an especially disgusting yellow mucousy looking one dripping off the handicap bar. There is toilet paper strewn all over, too. I still have to pee. I end up getting shit on my hand. Then I\\u2019m trapped in this repeated portion of the dream, where I am trying to pull my pants up. I have one of my son\\u2019s diapers on and as I\\u2019m pulling the pants and diaper up, I keep smearing poop on the outside of the diaper\\u2019s right panel. It\\u2019s gross. I\\u2019m trying to repeat the scene in the dream to make the poop disappear, rather than deal with cleaning it up. I am in this bathroom with all this shit for a really long time. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m at a restaurant, sitting at a table all by myself. I\\u2019m looking out across the other tables and I see an acquaintance, Liz, and her husband. She is wearing a revealing black and red snake skin dress that displays her body and all her tattoos. She\\u2019s also wearing high red shoes. She\\u2019s flaunting her body. She\\u2019s looking back and forth at me and my husband. I see that my husband is sitting at a table near her. My husband is sitting with another person - this person is both the man I was enjoying tea with and a woman, somehow. Liz has a haughty look about her, assuming things aren\\u2019t going well with my husband because I\\u2019m sitting alone and my husband is enjoying the company of another person for dinner. Liz gets up and walks around to my husband\\u2019s table to say hello. All the while, her chin is lifted and she\\u2019s looking back and forth between my husband and me in this \\u201cknowing\\u201d way. It\\u2019s extremely uncomfortable. Her husband is also looking back and forth, more curious than haughty. The dream shifts again and I\\u2019m in a store. I have two massage tables set up near each other. I\\u2019m on probation and they\\u2019re deciding whether to imprison me or not. A man comes in - he\\u2019s the one who makes the decision. He lies down on one of the tables. Another woman who is also in charge is on the other table and the tables are actually right next to each other. We move the tables apart a bit. I massage his neck and head. He gets up to take care of some work. I tell him his scalenes and upper trapezius muscles were very tight, and I tell him what I did. Even though the work was good, they decide to imprison me. They lock me up in a room. At first I\\u2019m quiet but then after they leave, I bang on the door. The man from the tea house is there on the other side of the door. I ask him to help me, but he won\\u2019t.\"],[\"It\\u2019s a summer night. I\\u2019m doing work for Edward.. There\\u2019s a cottage with a garden. He sends me out with garden shears and a request to find five poles. I go out into the garden and I walk all the way out to the far end where there is a fence. I see five wooden poles lined up along the fence and pressed into the soil, standing up. I wonder if I\\u2019m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they\\u2019re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They\\u2019re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest. We\\u2019re all looking into the dirt. It\\u2019s a fascinating garden walk in the night. He finds a big snail with a grey-silver spiral shell. He taps lightly on the shell with a stick to show us. Then there\\u2019s something about talking cats. In another scene, I\\u2019m possibly in danger. It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m running, running, running. I\\u2019m dancing as part of a dance company. We\\u2019re rehearsing. I\\u2019m in the locker room getting ready to dance, but also scared to be found.\"],[\"I am in Elizabeth\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the house I\\u2019ve always known since I was young. We\\u2019ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I\\u2019ve brought isn\\u2019t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, \\u201cSee how tall the ceiling is?! It\\u2019s always been this tall.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYes, so tall!\\u201d Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can\\u2019t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn\\u2019t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she\\u2019ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, \\u201cOh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I\\u2019ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.\\u201d She\\u2019s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I\\u2019m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day. When I go to her office this time, it\\u2019s different. There are walls around the office. She\\u2019s there, but the bears are not.\"],[\"My husband has just come home. As he was walking under a bridge, a woman slid her hand down his leg. He stopped and had sex with her. He comes back and tells me as if it were fine. I am livid. I get aggressive in my words and actions. I poke him really hard in the ribs and push him back. He is turning me into the person in the wrong. I am so angry that he would do this and act like it is okay because it happened under the bridge and she invited the encounter.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching as a group of people are training for combat. It seems to be a private army. Brad Pitt jumps into the courtyard. He confronts the leader. He says he wants to meet him in hand to hand combat. So the leader agrees. They begin this extreme demonstration of skill. Brad Pitt is wearing a big black trench coat and a mask. The guy tells him that he cannot let go while they are shaking. There\\u2019s an odd moment where the two men are in a firm grip, apparently shaking hands, but jaws clenched, muscles rigid, and sweating. All of a sudden, the leader whirls Brad Pitt across the courtyard. He hits a huge door, but then picks up a hose and sprays the leader down with high pressure. He is then accepted into the tribe.\"],[\"I am outside walking my bike with my husband through a park. We go inside and it\\u2019s close to an appointment time that I need to make. I have to get something for my bike, but can\\u2019t remember what it is. I\\u2019m on the second floor of a huge bike shop. My husband is with me. I take my bike all the way down the hallway. I\\u2019m looking at baskets. Suddenly my bike has disappeared. I haven\\u2019t seen anybody. I haven\\u2019t gone anywhere. It\\u2019s just gone. Then I start to panic because I need my bike to get to my appointment on time. I run back down the hall. My husband is right behind me now. I say, \\u201cMy bike has disappeared!\\u201d He\\u2019s helping me look everywhere. We\\u2019re looking and looking and we can\\u2019t find it. It\\u2019s just vanished. We go downstairs and there are people standing in line to buy their things. I cut right to the front of the line in my panic. There are three cash registers checking people out. One person waves her hand and I step right up to her. I tell her what's happened. She says, \\u201cOh no, we\\u2019ll look for it. What\\u2019s your name? I\\u2019ll make a note of it here. I\\u2019ll give you a call. In the meantime, do you want to buy a bike or something?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cNo. I just need to go.\\u201d My husband and I go out. Now it\\u2019s pouring rain and it\\u2019s dark because it\\u2019s night. I can\\u2019t even imagine riding my bike in this heavy rain and through all the puddles. I\\u2019m still really upset because I\\u2019ll be late. I may have already missed the appointment.\"],[\"My son is in an outdoor hot tub jacuzzi. I go over to get in with him and see there is shit everywhere in the water. It\\u2019s not his. It was just floating in the tub. There are other people in the hot tub - random people from a dance company. They are talking about their dance company. They ask me why I haven\\u2019t left the company that I\\u2019ve joined yet. They ask, \\u201cHasn\\u2019t it been enough? Why do you still stay?\\u201d I step in to try and get my son out. He submerses himself under the water. Now it\\u2019s worse because I\\u2019m afraid he could be ingesting this poop water. There\\u2019s a moment of panic when I try to get him from under the water. He\\u2019s younger than he is now - probably 9 months or so. I scoop him up out of the water. The poop has not only been stirred up in the water, but is now stuck to my legs, arms and hands. I\\u2019m trying to keep hold of my son while washing the shit off. It\\u2019s turned into a facial mask consistency - slimy and fully stuck on me. I\\u2019m absolutely disgusted. I get out and I still have this on me. We have to get dressed. Now we\\u2019re walking down a street through a neighborhood to downtown. There are a lot of other people walking on the street, too - actually walking in the middle of the street because it has been closed to vehicle traffic. There are quite a few homeless people with shopping carts and random plastic bags of things loitering around and quite dirty. We have to stop at a stoplight. Then we keep on going. We end up at a food stand and order food to go. I\\u2019m with my husband and my son now. They give us our food in a to-go bag. The plastic bag has a knot in the top to hold it closed and trying not to touch more of it because I don\\u2019t know how clean the bag is and I don't want to contaminate the food. I don\\u2019t want to be contaminated and I don\\u2019t want to contaminate the food, myself. We keep on walking and end up at a food truck place with multiple vendors. At one stand, they are doing a cooking demonstration. They are making an amazing wrap with long filets of salmon and cucumber and a wonderful lemongrass sauce. They are demonstrating the creation of this food. My son and I are watching as my husband goes to wash his hands. I\\u2019m holding the other food and regretting that we bought it before we knew about this food. The salmon dish looks delicious. I notice my husband has been gone for a long time. I go looking for him. I can\\u2019t find him anywhere. Finally I see a round table with all our stuff on it - our wet clothes laid out on the table and over the chairs. Our bag is on the chair, too. I\\u2019m relieved to see that the clothes are out to dry. He returns while we settle in to eat.\"],[\"I am walking through the woods with a group of people. Tad is there in this group, too. He lingers towards the back and I slow down to linger with him. We walk closer together and brush shoulders and hands as we talk. He pulls me over and begins kissing me. It\\u2019s intoxicating. We make love in a clearing. Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There\\u2019s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I\\u2019m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there\\u2019s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I\\u2019ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I\\u2019ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend. My friend is at a bar and I tell them what\\u2019s going on. I laugh. Then I\\u2019m suddenly at the bar, outside. I can see stuffed animal penguins in the grass - one on its side and one on its feet, walking towards the water. There\\u2019s another moment with Tad - beautiful and romantic coming together that I wish I could remember better.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a retreat - a weekend getaway with my husband and son. We\\u2019ve rented a house. I\\u2019m upstairs in the bathroom. My son is with me in the bathroom sitting at a table. I\\u2019m going to the bathroom, then realizing that my husband\\u2019s brother is there with me. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. I walk out without flushing the toilet. I also take off my shirt, but am again surprised that it\\u2019s not my husband who\\u2019s with me, but his brother. Then my husband comes home and goes up to the bathroom. He had been out. He looks into the toilet and is upset. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. Now I\\u2019m in an office building or a house - not mine or one I recognize. My friend is sitting on the kitchen counter. She looks at me as if she wants something from me. She wants to show me a picture she made. There is a window and a butterfly bush outside the window. Butterflies are flying around. My husband is standing there at the window and tells me how much he enjoys getting away for the weekend.\"],[\"At the last minute, Burning Man is happening this year. It\\u2019s very low key, but still in the desert. You just arrive and buy tickets at $15/person. You can also purchase rooms for $10/night. I go with my husband. We park the car on the side of the road, then walk through rusted out picked apart cars and airplanes with a bunch of white men smoking and drinking beer. We see our friends Diane and Warren in line. Diane offers to buy our tickets. I think it\\u2019s so nice of her. I then wonder what we\\u2019re going to do about our sleeping situation. We didn\\u2019t bring sleeping pads or blankets, so we\\u2019ll be sleeping in the car through the cold night and just throwing clothes over us. Now I think we might be able to afford a night or so in the hotel because Diane bought our tickets. We are walking through the festival. It\\u2019s more like a regular festival with vendors rather than Burning Man\\u2019s creative form of energy exchange and generous artistic sharing. As we continue to walk, we end up on a concrete street with hotels and office buildings. My husband looks up into a window and it\\u2019s cracked by a bullet hole. There is blood splattered all over the window. We don\\u2019t know if it just happened or if it\\u2019s been there a long time. We also don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an artistic expression of some kind. We don\\u2019t know if or how or where to report it and we keep on walking. But I have a feeling someone is dead in the hotel bathtub up there. Diane looks at a building on our side of the street. She exclaims about the black and green obsidian architectural accents on the building and around the windows. She thinks it would be wonderful to live in such a place because of the protection afforded by this stone. I think it\\u2019s beautiful, too. I like the idea of living in a place like that. We keep on walking. Then we are at the exit point of the festival where we get food to go and catch a bus to go back to our car. We\\u2019ve done this a couple days already and have our favorite dishes. I have been picking up a noodle bowl with a friend of mine (who I don\\u2019t know from waking life). We\\u2019re either really early or really late. The guy who makes our noodle bowl sees us and he secretly makes our food. But he can\\u2019t give it to us yet. So I go to the front and my friend stays and waits for our food. I\\u2019m waiting for him. The food is delivered to him, but then he never returns to me. It is revealed to me that he was trying to find me, but he stepped out into the road and was run over and killed by a car. All that\\u2019s left of him is a small clump or rat hair and crushed rat bones in the gutter. I\\u2019m concerned but not very upset. It seems more strange than awful. Then my stomach is not feeling up to eating, but I know I need to eat. I stand in line at a deli counter and ask if they serve hot sandwiches. They hand me a menu and I\\u2019m also trying to squint at and read the menu on the wall. I can\\u2019t read either, but they tell me they don\\u2019t make hot sandwiches for dinner but not now, so I go on. I go to the back where there is a bakery. I stand at the counter and no one else is there. The baker and owner of the bakery comes out from the back. He loves everything about baking. He\\u2019s telling me about all the ethnic baking styles he does. I say I want something warm and hot. He asks me what I like. I say I like hot. He asks me what kind of hot and I say \\u201cspicy.\\u201d He asks me what kind of spicy and I say \\u201cwarm spicy.\\u201d I\\u2019m not giving him a clear idea of what I like. He shows me a tray of baked goods and invites me to try it. I love it. I\\u2019m sitting on the side nibbling on this savory dish. Then a big group of people arrives and they start looking at all the sweet dishes. One person comes and sits next to me and eats their dish. I go up to the front and see they have a tray of sugar glazed sticky buns in the shape of mice. They tell me these are covered with raspberry sauce and filled with blueberry cream. So I take one and they ring me up at the register. They tell me it\\u2019s $12. I\\u2019m surprised that one pastry would cost so much. I tell them I already paid for the savory treat. They don\\u2019t really believe me, but then the owner comes out and tells them I did pay, so I only owe a few bucks. I feel nourished and I feel good about this exchange.\"],[\"I am teaching a yoga class. I\\u2019m subbing for my friend. It\\u2019s like I just pop up out of bed and there I am in the yoga studio. So I\\u2019m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it\\u2019s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don\\u2019t know who they are or where we are or what I\\u2019m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it\\u2019s just so odd. So I\\u2019m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren\\u2019t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I\\u2019m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can\\u2019t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it\\u2019s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn\\u2019t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It\\u2019s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I\\u2019m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can\\u2019t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I\\u2019ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark and crowded. I\\u2019m running away and trying to escape before Ursula finds me. She\\u2019s looking for me in the crowds. I can tell she wants to harm me. There is a conference and gathering of people dressed in futuristic clothes, all in black with coats. Somebody lets me borrow their big puffy black coat to help hide me. I put this on. There is a row of people who tell me I can blend in with their group. I think it will be a solution to sit in that row with them. Before the conference starts, I go to the bathroom. Ursula and Gemma walk in right behind me. They don\\u2019t see me and I slip into a stall. But Ursula steps into the stall next to me, to my right. Gemma continues to wait in line and I don\\u2019t know how to escape without her seeing me. I think I wait until they both use the other stall because there are only two stalls. I think it\\u2019s safe so I go out, but they are washing their hands. Gemma sees me, though. I join the row of people who told me I could hide with them, but Ursula spots me. I escape the conference center in my big puffy black coat. I go down the street to a small house where I see a boy digging in the dirt with a shovel and pale. His mom is standing on the porch. She offers to help hide me.\"],[\"There were a lot of parts to this dream and it felt like a big dream, but I only remember a small part. There is a house up on a mountain road where four people need to gather - two men and two women. The two men have arrived and one woman just arrived. I might be that woman. We are waiting for the fourth. She\\u2019s been given directions to find the house - just drive up this mountain road. As we are watching and waiting, we see a car pass by. It\\u2019s her. She keeps going up the road and misses the house. We are concerned and wonder how far she\\u2019ll drive before she realizes her mistake and comes back down.\"],[\"I am replaying in my dream over and over what I can\\u2019t decide is a memory from waking life or not. The so-called memory is a decision to do a dream experiment with Pema of remote viewing where we both decide on an image or visiting each other in the dream world, then coming back together to compare notes. I\\u2019m playing the scene over and over again as a loop to see if it actually happened in waking life. Then there are checkpoints, sometimes I\\u2019m walking, sometimes I\\u2019m in the backseat of a car, and sometimes I\\u2019m on the back of a motorcycle. I\\u2019m going through these checkpoints where we are searched and allowed to pass through or are held for more thorough searching. At one checkpoint that looks like airport security, bags are being passed through a scanner. There is a big bag of ceremonial cacao powder going through the scanning machine. For some reason, they need me to look at it and claim it as my own, placing a paper on it to show that it is mine. I wasn\\u2019t carrying it with me. It was a delivery to me. I So I agree. I think I\\u2019ll take it with me right away. They tell me I have to leave it for two weeks and come back to get it. At another point, I climb onto the back of a motorcycle that already has two people on it. I\\u2019m holding an egg that is cracking. It\\u2019s precious to be holding the egg at this moment of time, but it\\u2019s also making me feel somewhat uneasy because I think the mother should be watching over the egg. The motorcycle is speeding down the highway. I show the egg to the person sitting in front of me. I pass the cracking egg into their hand. The inner transparent membranous layer is now showing and I can see the animal underneath trying to make its way out. The egg cracks open entirely and the animal emerges. It is a little slimy cute bird-rat. It has wings and a long tail that extends up the animal\\u2019s back like an external spine. It looks like a dinosaur or maybe a dragon. We are holding the animal with care as the motorcycle continues to speed on.\"],[\"There is an operation with water dams - underground controlled waters. One of the dams breaks and the water is flooding. Tons of people are getting caught in the rushing water at the dam. Some are being washed away - children and adults of all ages. I can see them caught under the water. I\\u2019m among the people trying to fix it. Some of us are sitting at the dam, dropping things into the water. Others are trying to pull up and move metal fixtures and objects to stop the water from rushing. One woman at a control panel sees what\\u2019s going on. She strips her shirt off and runs into the water and swims up against the current to try and stop the flow. In another scene, I\\u2019m in my backyard. My neighbors are all walking around the grass. The fence has been broken and they\\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the pieces around to make a solid fence and container for the lawn again. In another scene, I\\u2019m walking up a hill to a mountain village with my son. We are following somebody. We hear a train in the distance. People are trying to stop the train. We are looking for our car. In another scene, we\\u2019ve been given a golden retriever puppy. It\\u2019s nighttime, but we don\\u2019t have a cage for the dog, so we go to a grocery outlet. They are closing up. But we need a dog cage. We end up buying other items. There is one item that goes through and I decide I don\\u2019t want it. We ask if we can return it and they say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s too late. We\\u2019re already past closing.\\u201d So we just decide to take it and come back to return it. Outside there are Latino men with blanket rolls setting up to sleep on the sidewalk for the night. Each of them also has what looks like a wolf head. When I look closely, it\\u2019s an entire white wolf pelt. They each killed their own wolf and made a protective cover for themselves to keep out the cold at night.\"],[\"I go to an address to find a new dress for Trina, my former boss. I\\u2019ve never been here before. When I walk in, my jaw drops in amazement. It\\u2019s a huge barn that has been converted into a boutique with gorgeous gowns hanging up on the walls all the way up to the ceiling. I\\u2019m looking for a particular style because the other dress was torn. It\\u2019s like an art gallery. I find a similar dress but with more vibrant colors. I ask for help getting it down. The woman who works here is thin and old with dry wrinkled skin. Her eyes are very bright and alive. She seems to know something I don\\u2019t know yet. Then she tells me that they have a dream group that meets here every other Tuesday. The man who leads this dream group is so eccentric and people really love him and adore him. I\\u2019m a little interested but also wary and doubtful of a man with such charisma and appeal. Then I\\u2019m walking down a hall in this big barn which I now realize is a retreat center. I see a sandwich board with an announcement for this dream workshop which happens to be this day later this evening. I then encounter this beautiful man in the hallway and there is something so magnetizing between the two of us. We are immediately drawn together and he\\u2019s pressing me against the wall. We are having an ecstatic sexual encounter, even though I\\u2019ve never seen him before. Then we smoothe down our clothes and go our individual ways. The old woman from the art dress show has arranged for me to have dinner with this dream teacher. So I go and am surprised to see the elegant dining room within the barn. I\\u2019m sitting at a table by myself. I order some food and this woman comes by. I\\u2019m loving my food - bread with oil for dipping. The woman pulls the bread out of my hand and starts to eat. I\\u2019m fighting her for it and think it\\u2019s so beyond that she\\u2019s decided to come up and eat my food! We\\u2019re having a fight about it and she just doesn\\u2019t understand. She wants to sue me not letting her eat my own food. Then the dream teacher\\u2019s assistant sits at the other side - I don\\u2019t know if they are a man or woman. The man from the hallway comes and sits directly across from me and gives me this smile. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that man in the hallway was this dream teacher.\\u201d I feel a bit awkward and don\\u2019t know what to say. He\\u2019s smiling at me in a knowing kind of laughing way and is enjoying my little shock. He introduces himself as if meeting me for the first time. I play along. His assistant kind of knows what\\u2019s going on. They order the food for the whole table and seem to know the menu well. The food arrives - noodles, lobster, buttery decadent amazing melt in your mouth meal with the most exquisite wine. My senses are turned on to full ecstasy. We begin talking about dreams. I end up going to the dream group and I can feel why people love him. My whole self is turned on again. I go every week. It seems like every other week we have this amazing sexual experience together and the other weeks he\\u2019s just focused on teaching and being there for all the students. I accept that this is the education and experience. Our relationship is amazing. There are no emotional obligations or expectations. Each class, the chairs are adjusted. In the last part of the dream, I remember a woman sitting in front of me. She\\u2019s a younger woman and hasn\\u2019t had any children, so her body hasn\\u2019t been stretched and it\\u2019s still in a bouncy young shape. She\\u2019s wearing a teeny tiny zebra print bikini bottoms. She\\u2019s leaning over in a provocative way then arching her back across the back of the chair revealing her beautiful sexy body and trying to catch his attention. I feel unhappy and insecure. My friend sitting next to me tells me, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it. He\\u2019s completely yours, through and through.\\u201d\"],[\"I am in the back of a building. There\\u2019s a man who really loves me. We\\u2019re wanting to be together, Then I am with this man and a group of priestesses building an altar. Gwen, Erin and Kem are there. Ursula is conspicuously not there. We put items on the altar, each of us contributing to different altars. The image that is most clear to me is a pile of tarot cards spread across the table, a picture of red shoes and an actual pair of red satin pointe shoes at the center of the altar.\"],[\"All I can remember is a mason jar with a smoothie in it and a transparent baby caterpillar climbing over the rim. I think it\\u2019s gross and wonder how many other bugs might be in the smoothie.\"],[\"There was so much to this dream but I\\u2019ve forgotten most of it. It felt important. People have made sand sculptures. Three people have made turtles. Two were too round. The third one is life-like. I see it with sand roses, then I see it lined with blue beer cans. Then I see it standing on its back fins on top of one of the other turtles. It is waving its fins in the air and saying: \\u201cThis is how a turtle is supposed to look. See how flat I am?\\u201d\"],[\"We\\u2019re visiting a female teacher, somewhat like a swami or guru, at her luxurious apartments in a city. She is of Indian descent. She is very alluring and has a lot of wealth and beauty and power. We\\u2019re at the dinner table. Fae is going through a process of some kind - she\\u2019s having a hard time and people are gathering to help her. The minister\\u2019s wife does some beautiful singing and healing with hands, whooshing away the worry, concern and pain. Then people gather closer to help, but Fae feels complete and most of the people go away. I stay. George is sitting at the table and speaking with Fae in the voice of our shadow work teacher. He\\u2019s helping her get clear on some things. He looks at me and talks with me in the same voice. Then we have to go. I have to go with my husband and we must leave quickly. I have a bag and am going down a hallway to an elevator. I get in the elevator, but my husband is still back in the apartments. I am trying to hold the elevator open. A guy comes. He\\u2019s leering at me. He has my husband\\u2019s backpack. I don\\u2019t want to be stuck in this elevator alone with him - I have a bad feeling about him. After a while of me insisting that we hold the door open, other people come. A mom is pushing her mentally/physically disabled child in a big plastic car. Other people come in and the elevator is full. My fingers slip and the doors close. The elevator goes down and when we get to the street level, everybody pours out. We\\u2019re on the streets of New York. there\\u2019s no way to get back up, except if we stand in a long line for the next elevator. I\\u2019m panicked because I\\u2019ve lost my husband\\u2019s backpack. The guy has moved on. I see that the backpack has been dropped. I check and see that everything is still in it. I guess I just have to wait for my husband to come down and hope he can find me. The city is so big and overwhelming. Then it\\u2019s later in the dream and I\\u2019m back in the luxury apartments. The teacher is preparing to go out for the evening. My husband wants to go and so do I. She says we can both come, but she has a glint in her eye. I remember my son is asleep upstairs and we both can\\u2019t go if no one stays to watch him. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what we can do. There are other people in the house - her male consort and other people that my son hasn\\u2019t met. I guess it will be okay. She takes me upstairs and looks at my shoes. I\\u2019m wearing red moccasins that are good walking shoes, but she scoffs at them - they\\u2019re quite ugly. Her shoes have a point at the end and are intricately beaded with lovely tassels. She tells me I need to change my shoes if I want to go out with them. Then she tells me she has a wife for my husband or maybe my brother (who I don\\u2019t have in waking life). I\\u2019m confused and concerned. She shows me a picture - a Christmas card - with a family. She points out a woman with a round face and kinky hair. There\\u2019s also a photo of her with her friend and her son floating in a jacuzzi. They\\u2019re holding a onesie over the baby. I\\u2019m wondering how much time I\\u2019ll have with my husband if he\\u2019s with her. It\\u2019s very confusing. I realize that she\\u2019s talking about someone else.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving along a beautiful lush coastline, maybe Oregon, maybe Ireland, maybe Hawaii. I\\u2019m going to a hotel with a small group of people for an educational high level training of some kind. I don\\u2019t recall who was there, except for Jeremy. Zoe is still alive, but she\\u2019s at their house and near her death. We arrive and are settling in. Somewhere around three o\\u2019clock, Jeremy gets a call from Zoe. She's distressed and feels very close to death. He, unusually, denies it and her because she\\u2019s been having similar experiences and it\\u2019s been more stressful and anxiety producing than real. So he hangs up the phone. I go into meditation. I see her in the courtyard outside their house - but it\\u2019s not their house in waking life. She\\u2019s dancing barefoot on the concrete ground. She gets really tired and turns off the music. She goes to the deck and lays her head down on the wooden deck and falls asleep for the last time. Somehow, we found out she has died. I know the exact moment because of my vision - it was in that three o\\u2019clock afternoon after, like 3:11pm. I gather my things to go with Jeremy over to the house. All the arrangements have been made by her friends. There are interactions in the hotel before we left, but I can\\u2019t recall them now. There\\u2019s a sense we will be spending the night together. We make the winding drive back along the coast to the house. When we arrive, her friends have laid her body out in the barn. Pema is there along with other friends who I\\u2019ve seen in passing. They\\u2019re preparing for the funeral or celebration of life. They\\u2019re slicing lemons in the kitchen and in the garden gathering flowers. They\\u2019re also gathering and writing poetry and preparing for guests. We go inside. People are sitting in rows. I sit by myself at the end of a row. I turn around and there are people looking at me. They are people from my past who I don\\u2019t remember as I\\u2019ve lived in many places and known many friends and forgotten many people. They share their memories of me and how they haven\\u2019t forgotten me. They\\u2019ve even waited for me to return, and I never did and I didn\\u2019t remember them. There is one man in particular who I\\u2019m drawn to - he\\u2019s a Pacific Islander, very robust and of the islands. I\\u2019m deeply attracted to him and wonder what is between us. I also see deep pockmarks on his face from cystic acne when he was younger. There\\u2019s a woman sitting next to him who also has scars on her face from acne. The people are so crowded and sitting close together. The ceremony is about to begin. I\\u2019m a little concerned that we could all catch the coronavirus if anybody had it. I begin to lift my collar over my face, but decide against it and instead intend to breathe in my own space. People are singing and saying poetry for Zoe. It\\u2019s a beautiful ceremony. Some time passes. Jeremy tells me that Zoe has been moved to the grey house and there will be a viewing. He invites me to go. I walk in and see people sitting at banquet tables. Immediately I see my grandmother and she\\u2019s sitting next to my grandfather. My uncles are with them and so are Aunt Frieda and Bertie (they are twins and my grandmother\\u2019s sisters) and other people who are family - perhaps my grandmother\\u2019s other siblings. I\\u2019m overjoyed to see her and it\\u2019s so real, except that everyone has an otherworldly shine and vitality that is a more than human vitality. I don\\u2019t ever talk to my grandmother. I hug my uncles who are both still alive in waking life. I go to the end of the row and connect with my great aunt.\"],[\"I arrive at an international train station. It\\u2019s been a long journey and I\\u2019m tired and hungry. I find an abandoned small purse like a wallet - it\\u2019s flat but full. I open it and see a lot of money, credit and bank cards. I take it and am not sure what to do with it. I don\\u2019t speak the language and the officials here seem untrustworthy. So I take it with me. I sit at a table with friends and I show it to them. Some time passes and we are waiting. Swamiji arrives and takes us to the center. We get settled in. Somebody needs some money. I give her the bank card and the whole purse to extract the money. I tell her to keep it because I don\\u2019t want it on me anymore. I\\u2019m sitting with Swamiji and he gives me a lesson of some kind. I tell him about the purse and money. He\\u2019s upset because the purse holds a U.S. passport and tracking devices, so anyone who has taken the money could be accused of theft and charged. I\\u2019m a bit worried for myself, too, because I took some cash earlier to buy some food for myself. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to replenish the cash and we are both trying to figure out where the woman has gone who took the purse. We don\\u2019t want to get involved with the authorities. Swamiji is very concerned.\"],[\"Multiple dreams seem to be occurring at the same time. One dream keeps looping like a mental thought. I have ideas about the sleep and dream database. I\\u2019m trying to make sure I remember them. I\\u2019m at a computer and wanting to find all the dreams by a certain participant and search by participant name. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to do this. I\\u2019m looking for that search function and trying to make sure my conscious mind remembers to ask Edward about this the next day.\"],[\"There\\u2019s an awkward dream with a former friend, Liz. It\\u2019s like Edward and I have given her an itemized receipt or invoice for her to review and pay. She\\u2019s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There\\u2019s another dream where we\\u2019re looking at a house. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull. In another dream scene, I go into a bakery through the side door where baking scientists are discussing plans for the day. I\\u2019m not sure whether to leave or stay and ask my question. I don\\u2019t feel particularly welcome in this food laboratory.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying at a big house. I\\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment with a woman who reminds me of Geri (a friend who worked for Burning Man and who I camped with a couple times) for 11am the next day. There are a lot of people here. I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It\\u2019s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn\\u2019t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I\\u2019m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She\\u2019s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can\\u2019t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I\\u2019m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I\\u2019m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren\\u2019t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day\\u2019s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I\\u2019m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I\\u2019m waiting at the couches - I\\u2019ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I\\u2019m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it\\u2019s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I\\u2019m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I\\u2019m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I\\u2019m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn\\u2019t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don\\u2019t want to do it anymore and I\\u2019m not going to come back. She says, \\u201cWell, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle. This is not something you give up so quickly.\\u201d I doubt myself and wonder if this is a good idea even though it doesn\\u2019t feel right or fitting. I agree to come back one more time to give it another chance.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a little town, in and out of small groups of people. We\\u2019re told it\\u2019s going to rain tonight, so we\\u2019re coming up with a plan of whether to stay or go. Some of the people live here and others of us are just visiting. A couple of my patients (lesbian women partners) have a room here and they also have a roommate. They show me their apartment and it\\u2019s quite interesting. We walk in through the door and the king sized bed is right there. There\\u2019s a kitchen and laundry room off to the side and an additional bedroom for the roommate to the right behind a curtain. The roommate comes and they show me around. Somehow I know that Liam is there. I have a flash of having seen him earlier in the morning. Now it\\u2019s getting towards evening. I am with another person - sometimes the person is a woman and sometimes the person is a man. We meet up with Liam in the hallway of the hotel. He wants to take us to his rooms and show us where he\\u2019s been staying. It\\u2019s not so easy to get to his rooms. He takes us down the hallway, down a back set of stairs, and across another hallway. We\\u2019re on the floor just below the ground where the windows are just above the ground. We come to his rooms, but we can\\u2019t enter from the hallway. So we have to go through the brothers\\u2019 room next door. This room is where five men are staying. He knocks on the door and we walk through. The men are all hanging around on couches watching a show, probably a sports show. One man has a girlfriend and she\\u2019s watching me as if I don\\u2019t belong. We pass through a door and down a short hallway to Liam\\u2019s room. He opens the door and there\\u2019s a naked woman wrapped up in a white sheet as if she\\u2019s just been ravished in the morning and sleeping all day. At first I think it\\u2019s his wife and am thinking I should leave. But then she rolls over. She\\u2019s a very tiny Asian woman. I guess they\\u2019ve been practicing tantric sex secrets and she has a book. There\\u2019s an invitation for all of us to be together. She instructs us. We all look at each other. Liam and I lock eyes and nod. He leans towards the man first as if inviting him in, but then the magnetism between us is too strong and he leans into me. We feel so good together, rolling around the bed. I want to stay in his embrace. It feels so right and natural. I want to remember this feeling.\"],[\"This is the last part of the dream: I\\u2019m with a group of people in a tropical place. There\\u2019s red dirt like Hawaii, or maybe Costa Rica. My husband along with a couple (our friends and both yoga teachers), and a few others. We\\u2019ve been looking at houses. We come to this piece of land. Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We\\u2019re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they\\u2019re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They\\u2019re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we\\u2019re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings. I see people making the paper boats with bits of paper they found in the trash. There\\u2019s also some kind of healing going on.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at an airport. I\\u2019m sitting at a table playing a card or domino game with my grandmother and Ted. There is definitely a strong desire and attraction between Ted and me. We want to find a place and time after the game to be together. My grandmother is watching without judgment. She knows. There\\u2019s absolutely no judgment from her, but for me I feel a combination of comfort with her and a strong charge of desire and comfort in playing with him, especially when our hands occasionally touch. I have a wallet. I need to pay for something - my portion of a rent or dues as part of a big group. I take my wallet out to pay. Somehow my husband now has my wallet and takes care of the payment for me. My grandmother goes on to catch her plane. Ted and I walk together through a crowd, but not wanting to attract any attention because he is well respected in this group as am I - we are both known. Now I\\u2019m looking for a new carry-on suitcase. There are stores all over. I have an argument with my husband about which one to get and it\\u2019s so frustrating. I see a store with some beautiful floral suitcases on the loft. I\\u2019m told that this shopkeeper knows exactly what I need. I consult with her and choose one. I panic when I try to pay and can\\u2019t find my wallet. Ted goes to look for it. Then I remember that my husband has it. He scoffs at me and says the wallet is in the jacket, or at least that\\u2019s where he put it and last saw it. I\\u2019m frustrated because I don\\u2019t trust that he put it in the jacket in a secure way. I\\u2019m also concerned he just left it somewhere. Then I come upon a huge underground room - it\\u2019s like an underground sea with big pillars holding up the roof. It\\u2019s dark. I see wading in the shallow water, a figure like Merlin in a cape and holding a staff. I wade into the water to see him. I\\u2019m still thinking of and desiring Ted. I look up and see people coming across the bridge. They are carrying my coat. They give the coat to me. I feel through it and cannot find my wallet. It\\u2019s the wrong coat and my wallet is not there. I\\u2019m shaking it and feeling all over. People walk into the water then walk out. I\\u2019m not sure if they have my highest interest in mind. They are communicating with the magician. I leave. I do find the correct jacket with the wallet in the pocket.\"],[\"\\u201cMass Inoculations\\u201d I\\u2019m at Whole Foods. There\\u2019s an announcement that all customers must line up immediately at the front of the store. The doors are locked so no one can leave. A nurse is sitting at a desk and we line up in front of her. I\\u2019m about in the middle of the line. The nurse is spraying a vaccine mist for SARS-CoV-2 in front of each person\\u2019s nose and requiring them to sniff deeply to bring it in. She does not explain what it is or how it works. I comply the first time because it does not seem too harmful for my body, but I try not to breathe it in deeply. But the next time around, she takes out a long thin needle connected to a vat of the vaccine. When it\\u2019s my turn, I say no. I am firm but non-violent in my resistance. She has been prepared for this scenario. So instead of poking me with the needle, she pushes a stronger dose of the nasal mist up into my nostrils. I can\\u2019t breathe through my right nostril at first, but she continues to be steady and persistent in her administration of the proper dose. I do eventually take it in. i am allowed to go home. I stop at a doctor\\u2019s office for some reason. I see another mother from town. There\\u2019s some kind of dance with distancing and gauging whether it\\u2019s okay now to be near each other, talk or communicate in any way. I go home, but it\\u2019s not really my home. I\\u2019m in a room on the third floor. People are gathered downstairs in the courtyard, drinking and eating. I stand at the window watching. A foreign man sees me. He saw me at the doctor\\u2019s office, too, and was attracted to me. I\\u2019m not sure whether to be afraid of him or not. I step back from the window, stand naked at the end of the bed and fall backwards. Somehow he sees me do this through the window. I stay in my room lying on my back, scanning my body for any harmful effects from the spray. I want my husband to come home soon. He does, but only briefly. He has to go somewhere. I offer to drive him because I don\\u2019t want to be left alone in case something bad happens to me.\"],[\"I wake up from a nightmare screaming for the police.\"],[\"A woman in a striped pant jumpsuit is being interviewed about her upcoming wedding. The night before she had a party with her bridesmaids. They were wearing their wedding clothes and now they\\u2019re dirty and need to be laundered for the ceremony.\"],[\"A dinner event. A wild animal runs through, injured. I chase after this animal. There are other wild animals running with me. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll blend in with them and they will not notice I\\u2019m human, but animal like them. We\\u2019ll run together and catch up with the injured one ahead. A man who runs with these animals has joined us and is running just behind me down the path. One of the animals falls but is able to get up and continue. Scene change. A group of people gather on a rooftop. They are making a temporary home each night on this roof, setting up tents, cooking food. A man who used to live in his van at the river is there. He now has a truck and it doesn\\u2019t appear that he lives in the truck, so I think he\\u2019s bought a house. But he is traveling with us. Every night we set everything up then take everything down in the morning. We go on a journey during the day, taking the truck. We pull out all our kitchen and sleeping supplies at night. One night, a woman takes out a fancy grill - so much nicer and easier to use than the one we\\u2019ve been using because there is no need to hook up propane. You just push a button for the heat and another button for the water. I feel a little ashamed of my smaller one, but realize mine serves a purpose because it is smaller and more easily transported.\"],[\"A man gets out of a bad limousine. Inside are two car seats for twins.\"],[\"I find out from Gail that the ladies didn\\u2019t really want to start meeting again with me. But they were humoring me. It feels really uncomfortable. I find this out while sitting with Gail at a small particle board table that has been painted and carved to look nicer. Gail\\u2019s oldest daughter is picking at the table and ruining it. Gai\\u2019s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She\\u2019s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks. She looks so beautiful and I\\u2019m envious, but know I couldn\\u2019t wear either of those outfits because I\\u2019m not tall and thin. Irene is going to meet her lover. Then she ends up going to the second story. Katy is there and they are having a wonderful deep engaging conversation. Again, I\\u2019m feeling left out as if I don\\u2019t belong and have nothing of value to contribute. On a floor above is a barber shop. My dad is getting his hair cut. My mom is there, too. Then somehow this barber shop is in another building - a hospital. Ted tells me he\\u2019s been enjoying talking to and seeing my parents on the floor just above where he works. I\\u2019m happy to see Ted and talk with him. My mom and I then go out to dinner. We\\u2019re sitting in a dark restaurant and a man is sitting with us. He feels a bit creepy. The waiter comes by and has a thick Irish accent. I order fries and then my mom orders. Then the waiter and the man start talking with each other in Gaelic. I\\u2019m wanting to interrupt so I can speak and learn the language again. The guy at my table is reading a poem. I ask if the word means garter as I make a motion of pulling a garter up over my leg. They look at me and laugh as if humoring me. They are laughing as if it was some sort of sexual innuendo that I didn\\u2019t catch. The waiter disappears and doesn\\u2019t return to our table. He has to declare bankruptcy but is being hunted down for money he owes. I find him in a crowded cafe with multiple serving stations. He\\u2019s making eggs with parmesan cheese to serve and judged. If he gets the cooking job, he\\u2019ll be able to pay his bills. I join him at the stove and help plate the eggs. I see a pile of powdered sugar on the plate, but think it should be on the dessert plate instead. His girlfriend is also helping. I scoop up the powdered sugar but don\\u2019t have a place for it while she plops savory sauce on the plate. It\\u2019s messy but it tastes good. I think it tastes so good that the appearance won\\u2019t matter.\"],[\"A really sinister feeling deram. I\\u2019m at a retreat center. The lodging is more like a dormitory, almost like Esalen with multiple bunk beds in each room. All the rooms are lined up in one long building. There\\u2019s a priest figure who\\u2019s either leading the retreat is a guru for this retreat center community. He\\u2019s a combination of different energies, including Swamiji. There are quite a few people gathered, some remind me of people from high school and others from college. There\\u2019s also my husband and me. My husband is upset and distant from me. He\\u2019s talking with other circles of people. I go into my room that I share with a group of people. I am witness to a murder and brainwashing. I\\u2019m not entirely brainwashed though, so I see it for what it is. It\\u2019s really disturbing. The priest is there. His assistant is with him. I feel sick to my stomach and don\\u2019t want to remember what I saw. They manipulate this young man, making him into a zombie-like state, then kiss all the life out of him. The people continue to do their things - folding clothes, brushing teeth, getting dressed. I hear the priest and his assistant talking about what to do with the body. The assistant says, \\u201cThis may have to be the last one for awhile because there might be some questions about the accident.\\u201d They plan to frame his death as a fall down the cliffs. I try to behave like the others to get away. I have a sense they\\u2019ve picked up on my more aware and attentive consciousness. I\\u2019m desperately looking for my husband to tell him because he\\u2019s one of the only ones I feel I can confide in now. I see him sitting on a bench with a small group of people. I want to draw him away so I can speak with him, but he doesn\\u2019t want to leave this group. He may somehow be involved with the deception somehow. The scene shifts. It seems like a month or so has passed. The same people are here. But now they are circulating around higher society at a symphony gala. They\\u2019re still doing the same sinister plotting and killing. Somehow they end up in the same location as me. I cross paths with them in the kitchen. More time has passed or maybe this is before. I\\u2019m going to a little library for a book reading and meditation. It\\u2019s in a neat geodesic dome. There\\u2019s an attic area upstairs with a woman who deceived my husband. The library has a collection of rare spiritual and magical books - not what you\\u2019d normally find in a library. This has been built as someone\\u2019s home and then later turned into a place for the public. I\\u2019m meeting with a small group of women. We\\u2019re sitting on the couch waiting for somebody. I recognize them from waking life, but they are distinctly different from their waking life appearance - shorter hair, heavier, odd voice, strange style of dress. They decide to begin. Usually I\\u2019m the one to begin, but Beth and Sherry begin instead. Beth takes out a long curved brown dried leaf with an incense stick and a white piece of copal. But then Shnati smiles and pops the copal in her mouth like a piece of candy. They light the incense and begin. Somebody sings a song. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m setting up a beach blanket with my mom, sister and son. It\\u2019s a lovely day. I\\u2019m watching a young Indian mother and her child play in the water. She\\u2019s round and full in her body, so is he. They go out into the waves during a lull. Others are swimming in the water. Then suddenly a big wave rises up out of the ocean. The wave swallows the mother and son, then it rushes up to our towel. It washes my Kindle away along with my bags, shoes and son. I\\u2019m scrambling waiting for the waves to calm so I can find everything and hoping the water returns it all. My son is okay. My Kindle is buried partially under the sand, still in its case. It\\u2019s okay. We move our towels up where there is a young gay couple on their towel. We\\u2019re close to them, but we will all move soon and have more space between us.\"],[\"An old building made of stone with old fixtures. It\\u2019s two maybe three stories with big wide stairs. I\\u2019m walking up to the second floor. There\\u2019s something about water, learning about the power and magic of water. There\\u2019s a feeling of conflict, misunderstanding, fear, manipulation, and yet an attempt at forming a common goal - a goal of learning then teaching. The power goes out in the building. Then, we\\u2019re in the hallway sweeping up dirt and hair that has fallen off people\\u2019s heads over the years. In another room, a class is beginning. Someone hands me an amulet of lava stone with red jewels and hammered iron. I wear it during the class. The class is a movement almost like yoga. I wear the amulet to charge it with power. I\\u2019m given two other amulets to wear and keep with me and charge up as well.\"],[\"I am touring a large apartment building. Units are being made available as people move. Some are moving out completely, others are moving for a better view. When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I\\u2019m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we\\u2019ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That\\u2019s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I\\u2019d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There\\u2019s a sign about reservations required. It\\u2019s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It\\u2019s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I\\u2019m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don\\u2019t want to pay because there\\u2019s only fifteen minutes left. I\\u2019m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn\\u2019t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we\\u2019re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It\\u2019s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I\\u2019m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there\\u2019s no place for me to sit. I\\u2019m watching my son to see if he\\u2019s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t find my husband. I\\u2019m at some kind of party at a country club or public pool. First I get a video call from my mom and sister. She\\u2019s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She\\u2019s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I\\u2019m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I\\u2019m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he\\u2019s actually swimming. He\\u2019s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I\\u2019m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can\\u2019t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I\\u2019m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he\\u2019s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I\\u2019m so mad at him. And he\\u2019s just shrugging me off. He tells me that he\\u2019s been doing other stuff, too, and not telling me about it: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been drinking six cups of coffee a day, drinking beer everyday, getting high everyday and smoking cigarettes again. I\\u2019ve been hiding from you the whole time because I know how upset you get.\\u201d I\\u2019m so mad that I want to beat him up. The woman comes back. She\\u2019s watching and smoking. She has tattoos all over her body and they aren\\u2019t well done or tastefully designed. She lifts up her shirt to show her belly. I can see she is very far along. The baby is lying sideways which isn\\u2019t good. I\\u2019m continuing to get more mad. She asks him where to send the invoice for the cigarettes. He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It\\u2019s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It\\u2019s \\u201cWhyNotHard\\u201d or \\u201cWhyNot&Hard\\u201d or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. I\\u2019m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he\\u2019s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we\\u2019re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together. One of them starts to sing and tells me she\\u2019s been watching and listening to the whole drama. She\\u2019s laughing because she\\u2019s been there before. They are all singing a song and the scene shifts. It\\u2019s like we are in a music video. We are standing under trees by a body of water. There are brown leaves covering the ground. I see an ice blue woman naked and lying partially hidden under the leaves. I wonder if she is me. I can\\u2019t recall what happens next. But then I am trying to teach a yoga class to a group of people who are wanting really advanced trick poses. I can do and teach these poses but I want to slowly warm them up and prepare them to do it safely. But, nobody is really paying attention. They have this better than thou attitude that turns me off. I don't want to continue teaching to people who are so disrespectful.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at Edward\\u2019s house on a river or a lake. There\\u2019s a gathering. People are arriving for a retreat. I\\u2019m organizing it and getting people situated in their rooms. I\\u2019m giving people the schedule for the weekend and providing bodywork during the down times. I\\u2019m filling the schedule up between the meeting times with activities. My first person is Deanne. She is wearing a scarf with Egyptian eye symbols. It\\u2019s making shadows of eyes on her cheeks and one over her brow. I remark on it and ask her about it. She shows me the scarf and how these symbols are made of metal and appliqued onto the ends of the scarf. She lies down on a table in a cold stone room. She enjoys it. My next person arrives - another yoga teacher. I\\u2019m a bit distracted while massaging her. I go upstairs and see Deanne and others on the third story getting chairs. I check in with Edward and see he\\u2019s with his family moving about and getting organized. I go back inside to the stone tower and see Deanne is receiving an oil treatment on her face. I go down the stairs to where I was working with the other woman. Someone else is with her giving her a cranial session. I look at the clock and see that I left early and didn\\u2019t give her enough time. I have already put the table away, but have her lie down on the stone floor. She pulls out a mat that people wipe their feet on and lies on it. I do some contacts on her head to complete the session. Then I walk outside for the gathering. It smells so good because flowers are blooming and the garden is thriving with vegetables and herbs. He asks If I know what kind of greens people most enjoy growing in Oregon at this time of year. I don\\u2019t know. He says, \\u201cCoconut arugula.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s interesting and haven\\u2019t heard of such a thing. But then someone laughs and says we don\\u2019t have greens in Oregon at this time of year. I see that people have set up their chairs in a circle by the garden and next to the water. A sidewalk goes right through the center of the circle and no one is sitting on the cement, so I do. I sit next to Edward on the ground. Everyone is sitting on chairs. Others arrive late and they are bringing pillars of stone to lean on. They\\u2019re boisterous and talking amongst themselves. Edward stands up and moves people around so that the people who were talking are no longer standing next to each other. He moves the chairs and pillars, too. The reorganization is a bit unsettling to the people who arrived early, but it seems to be the best approach and satisfies the lady of the house who is overseeing it all.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house or residential school. I\\u2019m taking my examinations - writing, math and dance. Eac person has their own private space to write. I go outside to the yard with my blue books and find a stone grotto to sit in. it\\u2019s dark outside, night. After I finish writing, I go back inside for the dance examination. This is a small performance based audition. I enter into the audition late and displace another woman who was until now guaranteed a spot in the school. Afterward, people begin talking about my skill and wondering where I learned to dance like that. I walk into another room where they keep the wild leopards. There is a pool with rocks along the side and some trees - an attempt to replicate a watering hole in their natural environment. I see a huge one - a paleolithic version of the leopard. This one is standing on a rock in the water. A younger adolescent leopard is lying splayed out on the beach, mouth open wide and teeth showing - it reminds me of a skinned lion rug I\\u2019ve seen before in waking life. There\\u2019s also a paleolithic leopard kitten crawling around the rocks. I'm surprised to see these wild animals inside a concrete room without windows. I go to another room that is a workroom with tools, like a woodwork or metal shop.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m downtown in an urban environment that I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It\\u2019s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There\\u2019s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I\\u2019m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn\\u2019t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it\\u2019s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn\\u2019t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren\\u2019t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a car. We are driving down a slippery wet road at night. My son is in the backseat with a man. My husband is driving and I\\u2019m in the passenger seat. We\\u2019re leaving the house for an errand. A family has moved into our apartment with us and has brought all their kitchen supplies including a large cast iron pan, a whole collection of knives, spatulas, spoons and other things. Before we left, I was making an egg on a pan with a non-stick surface. Whenever I stepped out of the kitchen, the mom came and moved my egg to the cast iron. I moved it back and she moved it again. It was really irritating and I wanted them out. I couldn\\u2019t imagine blending our households. So I left. We are dropping off her husband so he can pick up more things. He\\u2019s aware of her controlling ways in the household and especially in the kitchen. He\\u2019s silent and apologetic in his silence. We drop him off at a house in another neighborhood. Then my husband drops me off at a gym for a class. Other women are sitting on the street waiting for them to open. I lean my chiropractic table against a garage door. Behind the garage door are supplies for the dance and exercise classes. I can see numbers that tally the equipment to help keep track of it all when people use them for classes and return them later. A woman comes to sit beside me. She recognizes me and offers me a drink from her flask. I take it then the teacher comes and opens the doors. We all go inside and are all tipsy. The class begins but it is disorganized. It\\u2019s kind of like an adult gymnastics class and it feels like a gym I used to go to when I was younger - balance beams, parallel bars, tumbling floor and vault. A woman who identifies herself as Tiffany (I don\\u2019t know her from waking life) invites me to her family\\u2019s home after class. I go with her. Her aunt is sitting in the backseat and we are going to visit her mom, Norma.\"],[\"A line of four airport seats set up against the back of four other seats, the fake leather with metal bars between and the sling hammock kind of seat. Airport televisions up all around. There is a viewing of an independent film. The people showing it have made a big vat of spaghetti and meat sauce to share. People haven\\u2019t come to see the film, so there\\u2019s a huge excess of spaghetti and sauce spilling out of the containers and onto the seats and onto the floor. Another scene, arriving at a house on a hill that was just purchased by a lesbian couple. She opens a glass door to a courtyard with a beautiful view across the valley to the mountains. A storm is coming. We rush inside the house. It\\u2019s a small but cute house. I\\u2019m trying to close the french doors closed against the wind and rain. One set of doors close well. But I\\u2019m fighting against hurricane force wind to close the other set of doors. My dad appears and forcibly pulls the doors together and down. They shut, but they are torn from the top. The other woman partner comes by and is upset by the damage, but she\\u2019ll fix it once the storm passes.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a movie theater. It\\u2019s dark and grungy. People are scattered about and sitting in small clusters. The film begins but people are not interested. I\\u2019m drawn to looking at a screen of zoom video squares of the people in the theater - it\\u2019s like each group is being watched by unseen cameras. One woman has her head between her knees. She is vomiting on the floor. A man is sitting next to her, patting and rubbing her back. It\\u2019s not clear whether they\\u2019re together. It seems she is suffering from drugs in her system - she took too much and is beyond high. Other people are sleeping. Others are drunk. Others are in some kind of recovery program and barely holding it together. Some are relaxing. I, or somebody, is looking for a person to participate in a study. Their system needs to be pure and clear. Their mind needs to be clear. As I\\u2019m looking around, I see that even the people who aren\\u2019t high, drunk or stoned are in despair, and that won\\u2019t do.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a conference center. I\\u2019ve happened upon a group of people. They all look like they work with nature conservation in some way - forestry, seed saving, permaculture, climate change, soil, etc. I\\u2019m really interested in what\\u2019s happening here. I just sort of add myself to the group. This is the first day of their meeting. Everyone circles up and they all have name tags except me. The guide notices I don\\u2019t have a name tag and she asks if I registered for the day. I tell her no and I didn\\u2019t know about this until I just happened upon it, but I feel like I really need to be here. She stops for a bit and thinks about what I\\u2019ve said then says, \\u201cOkay, come with me.\\u201d Everyone breaks for gathering their things and getting ready for the day of being on the land and learning about the seeds, roots, berries, flowers and their conservation as well as their medicinal uses. I\\u2019m walking with the guide. She is a young woman with long blond hair. She has grown up in relationship with the land. We are at Esalen - my dream form of Esalen. We need to get permission from the front office so that I can be here, even though I\\u2019m not planning to stay overnight. They still need to register me for the course. We\\u2019re looking, but can\\u2019t find anyone with authority. We stop at her trailer so she can get a certificate and papers for me. The trailer is really interesting. I recognize it as somewhere I\\u2019ve been before, even though I haven\\u2019t in waking life. The trailer is reserved for visiting faculty. Before the closets were full of Burning Man style costume clothes that the teachers could wear around the campus. Another wall is lined with narrow shelves filled with small cylindrical bottles of herbs of all colors. There\\u2019s another set of wider shelves in the corner by the bed with books. It\\u2019s a sweet and comfortable place. I notice that the clothes have been traded out for doll-sized clothes, so it\\u2019s more for decoration than use. It\\u2019s a new COVID policy shift, so it still has the old flavor of how things used to be, but now the clothes can\\u2019t actually be worn. She gets what she needs and fills her bag for the day of teaching on the land. We leave. We pass through a dining area. They are just now putting out lunch. She suggests we stay for lunch. It\\u2019s a spread of delicious mini sliders - hamburgers and hot dogs with gourmet toppings, and caprese vegetarian ones. It all looks so beautiful and delicious. I surreptitiously reach for one and eat it, trying to look like I\\u2019m not actually chewing because I\\u2019m not registered and I\\u2019m not really supposed to be here. She is sitting at a table with colleagues and I go back for more because it\\u2019s so tasty! I want to try at least one of everything. I see my friend Mo from graduate school. I\\u2019m happily surprised to see him. He looks a bit sad. He tells me he\\u2019s been spending more time in San Francisco. I think that\\u2019s interesting because he lives in the East Bay. He says he\\u2019s been in SF more because he and his wife aren\\u2019t really doing well right now. He was married four or more years after me. I tell him he\\u2019ll be fine and his marriage will be okay because there are phases in a marriage when you don\\u2019t feel super connected, but you\\u2019ll come out of it and appreciate each other again. He\\u2019s hopeful but a bit weary to put his hope in my words. I look around and see that my guide has left. I tell him I have to go and hope to see him around later. I am looking for the group again. I\\u2019m in the huge conference center with many floors. There are start-up companies in meeting, people working on computers, miniature libraries with specialized topics for research. I\\u2019m wandering around and feeling lost. I find a woman sitting behind a glass - it looks like an information desk. I ask her about the group I\\u2019m looking for. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m more in charge of the people who rent space here for months and years rather than day visits.\\u201d She comes out from behind the glass and we go down the elevator. We get to an area that she says is their meeting space. It\\u2019s not at all familiar. I look way down and think I recognize some of the people. I really want to find them because I really want to go on this learning trek and know this is important knowledge to gather. She leaves me there and I\\u2019m trying to find my way down to the people. I feel at a complete loss and I\\u2019m lost.\"],[\"This dream is remembered mostly backwards. The last scene of the dream I look down at my phone and it\\u2019s lit up with Jeremy\\u2019s name. He\\u2019s calling. I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it\\u2019s him even though he\\u2019s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I\\u2019m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it\\u2019s not a video call, I can see him. He\\u2019s sitting on an oversized chair. He\\u2019s very awkward. He says, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s Jeremy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI know. Hi, how are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to be light. Then he says, \\u201cI owe you an explanation.\\u201d So then he starts to share. I can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I\\u2019m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It\\u2019s urgent. I\\u2019m running through snow. It\\u2019s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We\\u2019re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It\\u2019s a big pool and I\\u2019m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn\\u2019t notice that the water has been draining until it\\u2019s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I\\u2019m at dinner. It\\u2019s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in Hawaii by a lake, My parents and sister are nearby. I look down at the brown wet leaves at my feet. I see two snakes intertwined with each other. Then I\\u2019m shocked and worried because there aren\\u2019t supposed to be any snakes in Hawaii. I also know that Hawaii doesn\\u2019t have lakes, so I\\u2019m a bit confused, too. As I\\u2019m watching the snakes, I realize they\\u2019re mating and this is even worse because instead of just two snakes, there will be more and the island could be taken over by snakes. I look into the water and see another snake swimming in the water. As I watch, I realize it\\u2019s a huge anaconda and it\\u2019s undulating towards my mom, dad and sister. I yell at my parents and sister to warn them. I realize that I have to do something about this and find someone who can help me. Now I look at the ground again. The first two snakes are also anacondas - a lot larger than I first thought. There are also so many bathing snakes writhing around like earthworms, but they\\u2019re actually itty bitty baby snakes. I\\u2019m trying to cut them with a shovel. I can squash them with my shoes because I\\u2019m wearing flip flops and those won\\u2019t do. I\\u2019m looking for help and now realize that the snakes are a problem all over the island. I\\u2019m now at a hotel looking for more snakes and help. It\\u2019s late. I see Ted. We sit on a curb away from everyone else and have a talk before returning to our separate hotel rooms for the night.\"],[\"I'm a guest in a house similar to Swamiji\\u2019s home - a small community of people living together in a beautiful home on a hill. There is an extremely obese woman who we are trying to help downstairs. She\\u2019s so obese, she can\\u2019t walk. She\\u2019s also unable to talk, though her eyes are open and she is conscious. We have two ropes with heavy duty paper clips at the ends. The ropes are wrapped around her body. We swing one rope to the ceiling and it hooks up on the ceiling. The other rope is tied to the banister of the stairs. It\\u2019s a team effort. Two or three of us are trying to maneuver her down the stairs. We keep throwing the top rope to the ceiling, but then it hooks to places where it looks like it will pull the ceiling down. It\\u2019s like the ceiling is covered with a taut fabric and I\\u2019m concerned that the fabric will tear under her weight. We have to unhook the rope then hook it again. We get her down one flight of stairs and think we\\u2019re done. But then we look down and see more stairs. We are just at a loft area with a bed. I find myself attracted to the man who is helping, too. The other two helpers are women. While the others are resting on the loft and rebuilding their strength, I go upstairs for snack. Our friend has returned from the market and is preparing dinner. She offers me and my son some snacks - a bag of fresh plums that have just been picked and a bag of cornichon pickles. My son reaches into the pickle bag. Inside the bag is a little green car the same size and color as the pickles. I let him have it. We eat. While we are eating, a woman with black coiffed hair comes in the front door. She is the ex-girlfriend of the man who I was attracted to. She says that she has just returned from her travels and is going to drop her things off upstairs in his room. I go back downstairs and find that the others have moved downstairs to the healing pools. The obese woman is in her own warm pool soaking. The others are in another pool. The man is leaning against the side of the pool and his neck is sore from getting her downstairs. I slip into the water, too. I offer to help his neck, but he declines even though he is interested. He doesn\\u2019t want to ask more of me. Another woman who was helping asks if I can help her because she is also sore from the ordeal.\"],[\"I am hiding out with my husband at the border of Oregon and California. We are on the Oregon side in some bushes. We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We\\u2019ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we\\u2019ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn\\u2019t have to smear the lotion in the dog\\u2019s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they\\u2019re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They\\u2019ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I\\u2019m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I\\u2019m thinking that maybe he\\u2019ll drive because he isn\\u2019t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river. He has found a stick and a net on a long pole, like a pool skimmer. It\\u2019s broken around the edges and the net is slightly torn. A couple comes by with their dog on a leash. They let the dog off leash and the dog jumps in the water where my son was pretending to fish with his net. My son just stands and watches at first. But then he wants to try to fish for the dog. I tell him not to. There\\u2019s a little back and forth between us. I then tell my son that we will have to go to another part of the river or I\\u2019ll take away the net. I\\u2019d rather the people just leave with their dog instead of continuing to throw the stick into the water for the dog to fetch. Eventually I get my son to draw back and watch until they decide to leave.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a boat. I\\u2019m with my husband and son and somebody else, a captain who is directing the boat. There are other boats in the water. We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I\\u2019m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he\\u2019s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I\\u2019m looking around and notice it\\u2019s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I\\u2019m looking through the papers and see that there\\u2019s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I\\u2019m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He\\u2019s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It\\u2019s really rough and she hasn\\u2019t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It\\u2019s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I\\u2019m at a celebration for Ted, an award\\u2019s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I\\u2019m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there. His dad, who is dead in waking life, is there and drinking a huge glass mug of whisky and ice. His mom and I are sipping nicer whisky that I had brought. I make eye contact with him, smile and nod my head in congratulations for his accomplishments.\"],[\"All the women have gathered for my friend Talia\\u2019s birth. We\\u2019re inside a large room. She\\u2019s standing up higher and radiant in her pregnant fullness. She starts to feel labor beginning. We\\u2019re watching and singing and holding space. At one point, she\\u2019s in a smaller room. I hear her say that she pooped and a woman says, \\u201cgood, this is great, this is part of it.\\u201d Then another woman who sounds like my mother shames her for pooping. She says it\\u2019s not a good thing. I wish I was there to be another voice of support. She comes out of that room, clean and very much in the fire of crowning birth. I can see a redness and opening between her legs. She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We\\u2019re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She\\u2019s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby. I think I would not be happy if I were not the first to hold my baby. We all look and see that it is a healthy baby. We bring the baby back to Talia with love and devotion.\"],[\"Elevators going up and down. A mall. I\\u2019m with my childhood friend Elizabeth watching. People are wearing unusual clothes. Gwen is recording a podcast about inter-racial relationships. A group of us are gathered for the recording. The intro to the podcast is recorded by an Asian woman in a relationship with a black man. She is describing their relationship and it\\u2019s recorded like a guided meditation in a semi-darkened room. Then the lights turn on and Gwen is speaking about inter-racial relationships between white women and black men. I\\u2019m sitting beside her as support. The scene opens up and a white woman and black man are running. People are chasing and trying to track them down. They separate for safety and hope they can find each other again.\"],[\"Returning to the farm. Mexican laborers are all sleeping on the ground, passed out in sexual ecstasy, their pants down, all men. An investigation reveals that one man found a long crystal in the dirt and in secret stimulated himself until he orgasmed and fell asleep. Somehow the other men understood what happened and used the crystal, as well. Returning to the farm, a group of people are having their own experiences and judgments. There\\u2019s a beautiful ballerina with bright red lipstick. She is the object of attraction and desire, but she has none herself. So when she feels his attraction for her, she pretends sleep. She sees herself from the outside, her face pushed up with bright red lipstick smudged on her nose. She\\u2019d like to fix her face and make herself more beautiful in her sleep, but moving would betray that she was still awake. So she stays and she sees on her cheek the evidence of pimples and many breakouts when she was younger and wishes that away. But he stands over her and wishes for her warmth, wishes for connection. And they\\u2019re both alone in their thoughts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m waking up at a festival. I\\u2019m walking through to the ocean or bay. I see that some others are still sleeping and the beds are set up to be floating over the ocean with only a white gauze curtain around for a little privacy. I\\u2019m curious about it. I see my friend Maxine walking around in a huge hoop skirt. It looks like she\\u2019s wearing a long curly wig that goes all the way to the ground. Other people are dressed up in festival attire. I don\\u2019t think I am, but I can\\u2019t sense much about myself. There\\u2019s a water slide that people go down to splash in the water. I\\u2019m supposed to be covering Sophie\\u2019s shift. I don\\u2019t know whether it starts at 9 or 9:30, but I need to get there. But now it\\u2019s raining and grey, and I know I\\u2019m in San Francisco. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019ll get there and park and be on time. It\\u2019s more complicated than I thought it would be when I agreed to help. Now I realize it\\u2019s not a chiropractic shift, but I\\u2019m subbing a yoga or meditation class for her. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in another doctor\\u2019s office. It smells like cigarette smoke and really stuffy. All the other rooms are occupied and the doctor of physical therapist is running late. There isn\\u2019t enough room to teach a class and it won\\u2019t be worth my time or energy to do this, but I\\u2019ve committed. Then there\\u2019s a scene of my sister lying on her stomach and a prince speaking with her and evaluating whether she is a good choice for him or not.\"],[\"Food is being served on long tables set against each other end to end. There are big circular plates of a frittata like food with some light purple-pink sauce poured on top. There is an order for who is to get the food first, but there are mothers of young children who are pushing to the front and making a mess of things with their plates. They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates. She is justifying her actions saying, \\u201cThis is for my son and this is for my daughter and this is for my husband.\\u201d She keeps putting more and more pieces on her plate while people are hungrily pushing forward against us. I have my plate and at first just cut one piece, but then I get just a little more, then just a little more, beginning to feel the scarcity of hunger and not knowing if there will be enough. Then I\\u2019m upstairs in the same building and alone. It\\u2019s an old stone building without windows, but rather openings carved into the thick stone walls. There are two young boys who have been brainwashed in some way. They are putting stones in the openings to cover the light. As they do this, they are turning the building into marsh. I can see green vines growing from wherever they touch. I\\u2019m panicking then trying to control my breath and clear my mind so I can make a plan to save this all from collapsing and turning into marsh.\"],[\"There is a land we must pass through. I\\u2019m with a big group of people. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them from waking life. We get to a point where the tigers are. We\\u2019re strategizing and learning how to get through. We\\u2019re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It\\u2019s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don\\u2019t have anyone to pair off with, so I\\u2019m going through the motions by myself. I\\u2019m also wary of holding people\\u2019s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don\\u2019t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I\\u2019ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don\\u2019t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I\\u2019m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I\\u2019m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties. I\\u2019m sad and disappointed, I feel left out because they haven\\u2019t thought to invite me. I would like to be included.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Alice and we\\u2019re preparing an offering. People are gathered inside a tent, sitting around square wooden tables. They are all crowded around the tables waiting. I\\u2019m sitting next to Alice at the table. Right in front of me is a thick spider web. I can see spiders crawling on the web. It seems to be thickening with more layers. I stand up and back up. I look at her and say to her, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re attracting more bugs.\\u201d She laughs. A tall white woman with blonde hair is sitting across from us. I don\\u2019t recognize her from waking life. She is holding feathers. She says, \\u201cIt would be nice if we could bless the elements and call in the ancestors because we really need to talk to the ancestors. We begin the ceremony. Alice is playing music. It\\u2019s kind of off. Alice is playing pop songs and I\\u2019m trying to lead an embodiment practice and meditation. We are not in sync. In another scene, I\\u2019m with a group of strong men. I notice the strength of their upper bodies. They must be physically strong for what lies ahead. I\\u2019m helping to prepare them. There is also something about blood.\"],[\"I am walking through a downtown area. The streets are dark and wet. I\\u2019m looking for a hotel restaurant and spa. I find it and it\\u2019s larger and more elegant on the inside than it appears on the outside. I go to the concierge to make an appointment at the spa. They tell me to wait in the lobby and come back when they call my name. I look over the different treatment options on the spa menu. There are only women here - it\\u2019s a women only spa. I see Rose who I think is applying for a job here as a sexocological bodyworker and some other women I don\\u2019t recognize from waking life. After some time passes, they call me up to the desk. They give me a large ticket printed on brown cardstock. It has my name on the front and information for my first time. Then they give me my assigned therapist who will give me my treatment. They lead me to the back. I go down the stairs behind them. Instead of going directly to the spa, I go to the restaurant. It\\u2019s huge with tall ceilings. People are spaced out at different tables. I sit at my assigned table. A couple other people join me. I look at the menu and the food is unusual - fine dining breakfast/brunch. I order. The food arrives and it\\u2019s a crystallized strawberry fluff. It\\u2019s delicious. The person across from me is a chef and she\\u2019s talking about how she makes a strawberry ice cream. She gets the largest strawberries and cuts them in slices and places them together to make something like a boat. She makes the ice cream from scratch. The other person sitting next to me says, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s the most wonderful thing you\\u2019ve ever had!\\u201d She promises me an invitation to a dinner party at her home. I love the idea of going to a chef\\u2019s home for dinner. Meanwhile, the spa therapists are coming around and finding the people they recognize for their treatments - there are a lot of regulars here and I might be the only new person. I\\u2019m assigned to a person named Shannon. I think they are a woman. This person comes down and everyone knows and loves her. She is one of the most sought after therapists. She is being discreet, looking around for her client, not calling out names, because we are all supposed to be anonymous here. Then she starts singing a song about herself because we don\\u2019t recognize each other. Now I realize that she identifies as \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are tall, brown skin with big black hair, very lean and strong. I realize, \\u201cThis is Shannon.\\u201d I try to get their attention once they complete their song. Most of the others have gone to receive their treatment. I reach into my bag to get my ticket. I can\\u2019t find it at first and am concerned that I won\\u2019t be able to receive my session without it. It\\u2019s tucked in between notebooks and other papers. I take it out and show them my name and their name printed on the ticket. We go out and I don\\u2019t recall the treatment. Afterwards, I\\u2019m on a beach. My dad is sitting on a beach chair next to me. There\\u2019s another older man sitting next to him and some young adults in their late twenties sitting on a surfboard in front of us. My dad comments on one of the gals wearing a little bitty red one piece swimsuit. Her body is very young and firm. My dad talks to the old man next to him, assuming the young woman is this old man\\u2019s girlfriend. He tells the old man how lucky he is. I\\u2019m disgusted by the conversation between them. I get up and walk to the shore. I see small creatures digging holes in the sand after the waves go out. I dig a hole and am finding crawdads and am pulling them out while trying to avoid their claws. I look out at the ocean. The water is so clear. I see turtles and then this creature. At first I think the creature is another turtle, but when I look more closely, it\\u2019s like a dolphin with an elephant trunk. I point it out to people. We realize that the young woman who the men were talking about is the fiancee of the older man\\u2019s son. They all go inside a dive bar and are ordering drinks and cigars and talking about the plans for the rest of the night. It\\u2019s getting late and I\\u2019m wishing to be somewhere else.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Anya, Moira, Kel, and a new patient who I haven\\u2019t met yet. The office is down the street from a big house that is being used for multiple offices. I\\u2019m in the house. Anya and Kel are helping me set up the tables upstairs. People are arriving for sessions. A fire is lit in the fireplace. It\\u2019s dark and musty. There are quite a few massage and chiropractic tables folded in their traveling bags. There are tables and stacked chairs. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to set up the table for privacy and professionalism for my new patient, but it\\u2019s chaotic. This is a way for me to practice and for people to watch me work and potentially become patients.\"],[\"I can only remember two bits from an extensive dream. I\\u2019m walking down a city street. There are steps leading up to a second story restaurant. It\\u2019s an elegant cafe. I go up the stairs with my son. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I\\u2019m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we\\u2019ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I\\u2019ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he\\u2019s gone. He\\u2019s not on the stairs. I\\u2019m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s gone. In another scene, I\\u2019m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I\\u2019m at the baths. I\\u2019m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She\\u2019s watching the cat while the cat\\u2019s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I\\u2019m trying to pretend that I don\\u2019t know Ursula so that the woman doesn\\u2019t connect me with Ursula\\u2019s former apprentice.\"],[\"I accept Garth\\u2019s invitation to come and visit. He is staying in a multi level apartment building. I go by myself and knock on his door. His wife and daughter aren\\u2019t there, they just had a really big fight and his wife has left with their daughter. He invites me to sit down on the couch so I can do my work. I have my laptop. I sit on a fluffy green couch. He has all the ergonomic things and is handing me something to hold the computer and another thing to cancel the EMF and another thing to support my neck. He\\u2019s being attentive to me in all those ways. He invites me to put the computer down and sit next to him. I think about it for a while, then I do. He draws me closer to him. I pull back because I don\\u2019t want to betray her friendship. I want to open a conversation about their relationship to see if there's anything I can do to help mend the wounds. I know that cuddling him and giving him physical comfort wouldn\\u2019t be good for any of our relationships.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the bathroom with a couple other women. We are getting ready. They\\u2019re in and out of the shower. One woman is really fit and looks like she does yoga regularly. She is jumping up and down and dancing in the bathtub as she\\u2019s showering. She says she uses every opportunity to move her body. There\\u2019s something waiting outside the bathroom. It feels ritualistic and dark, involving blood, but I can\\u2019t recall anything more.\"],[\"Somehow I\\u2019m able to see the priestess message board and the communications that are occuring, written in gold filigree on a black background. I can see the names of the current priestesses and little gold fairies and the teachings being recorded here. I don\\u2019t know if they can tell I\\u2019m here observing. Ursula looks up as if she knows I\\u2019m here and I\\u2019m wondering if my name is appearing on the board as someone present and watching. The messages begin to disappear. The names are changed. I can\\u2019t understand them any longer. But I know one is her daughter and she is the \\u201cseanalair\\u201d or the \\u201cseantian.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m swimming underwater with really bright colorful fish and coral contrasted by big black octopus, seal, shark and people swimming in snorkel or scuba gear. I\\u2019m struck by the contrast between color and black.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a crowded dinner party. We haven\\u2019t sat down to eat yet. We\\u2019re all going in and out of the kitchen putting together a bunch of different salads and setting the table. They\\u2019re mostly young adults in their twenties, just out of college it seems. I get a phone call from a landline. It\\u2019s Ted. I can hardly hear him because of all the activity in the kitchen and people with their pots and pans and multiple conversations. I can hear the gist of it. He\\u2019s having a hard time. I suggest he come in for some care. He makes a comment that is the closest thing to being overt about his attraction to me that I\\u2019ve ever heard. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWill it be okay for you to treat someone who\\u2019s hitting on you?\\u201d I'm thinking about all the rules and regulations and if this would be okay because I would like to see him. The conversations in the kitchen get louder and someone asks me to set the table so I have to go. There\\u2019s a shift in the dream. There\\u2019s a young couple in a courtyard. Tables are set up for an event. The couple is wandering through. They\\u2019ve met each other here and are wanting to extend the night. They\\u2019re walking around and I\\u2019m watching them. They\\u2019re falling in love as the day and evening go by. Their families arrive and for some reason they\\u2019re not supposed to be together. The families overlook it for now. The dream goes by and they\\u2019re spending more time together. He\\u2019s painting her and writing about her. His family forbids them from seeing each other. But she\\u2019s moved in with him. She\\u2019s packing to go and she shows him where she has stored papers and journals beside his bed. She says, \\u201cIf you miss me and want to know me better, look through these papers.\\u201d There are empty plastic organizing folders and receipt folders filled with receipts from 2007 or 2017. She points out the years and says, \\u201cIf you want to know who I was back then, you can look at these.\\u201d She\\u2019s being transparent about her past. She has to leave and she does. They make an arrangement to meet at a sporting goods store in the future. She walks in and there are people taking a physical therapy exercise class at the back of the store and there are different exercise stations throughout the store. People are trying out the equipment and taking class. She wanders to the back and meets people and thinks she could help them more at her office. But she realizes they only have to pay $5 a class here and they are getting some help here. She sees him and they have to pretend they haven\\u2019t. She wanders to the front of the store where there are two television screens set up showing an exercise dance class. It\\u2019s an interesting setup because one television shows the front of the teacher and the other shows the back of the teacher, so it\\u2019s easier to follow along. He sees her dancing and walks over to sit near her and set up his art exhibit. Then his mom comes in and she\\u2019s dressed primly. She\\u2019s paging through the book the couple had made together - the woman has written the words and he\\u2019s drawn the pictures. A lot of the pictures are of the young woman. The mom is flipping through the book. There are pictures of the mom, too. She\\u2019s pretending to not be impressed but it is truly a fabulous piece of art. She\\u2019s there to lead a group of young girls in a dance performance. The girls are dressed in overcoats and hats with flowers. She\\u2019s so stern. At the end of the performance, instead of congratulating them on their performance, she coldly walks away.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a street, it\\u2019s dark and wet, like it\\u2019s been raining all day. It\\u2019s not currently raining. I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called \\u201cKali\\u2019s Eyes.\\u201d I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn\\u2019t functioning well and I can\\u2019t find what I\\u2019m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I\\u2019ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it\\u2019s really crowded. I\\u2019m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they\\u2019ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can\\u2019t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I\\u2019m frustrated. It\\u2019s also still COVID, so it\\u2019s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that\\u2019s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I\\u2019d like to sit on, but they\\u2019ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it\\u2019s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It\\u2019s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They\\u2019re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other\\u2019s faces, so it\\u2019s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It\\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\\u2019t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night, after hours, and I\\u2019m at the coffee shop - next door and outside. There are bins of spices. The owner of the coffee shop who I know socially is pouring the spices from the containers he used during the day and into the larger bulk bins. I see he accidentally mixes the salt and cayenne, pouring the salt into the cayenne bin and the cayenne into the salt bin. He\\u2019s distracted. He doesn\\u2019t realize what he\\u2019s doing in the moment. He realizes that I\\u2019m there and then notices his mistake and realizes he ruined the salt and cayenne and they\\u2019re basically unusable. Jeremy is here now. They are both implicating me and saying that I caused him to make this mistake and brought an evil omen.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at the table with my bodywork teacher and people who are new to his work and paying for continuing education. He invites me to stay, listen and learn again anything I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down an alley between row houses. I\\u2019m with my husband. We walk by this one house with people gathered in the front. It\\u2019s a neighborhood block party. The front of their house is decorated with so many succulents of all shapes, sizes and colors, some in boxes, others growing like vines. I comment that \\u201cSnow and Shelly\\u201d would like it. But I mean \\u201cHanna\\u201d and I wonder why I keep calling her Snow? We continue to walk a little further. I hear them laughing about their friends \\u201cSlow\\u201d which is their nickname for Hanna and Shelly together. Then my husband and I get to the end of the alley. There\\u2019s a curio shop with all kinds of odds and ends. There\\u2019s a sign that looks like a fish and you can tell that it maybe once said Carmel, but part of it is missing so you only see the C at the fish\\u2019s face and the E-L at the tail. Then my husband reaches up and touches an interesting looking tapestry. He touches the border and tells me to touch it, too. It\\u2019s a really soft silky hair and leather texture, beautifully crafted. My husband takes it down and brings it inside. There\\u2019s an older woman dressed in a white lace bohemian dress behind the counter. There are two dogs running around. The dogs go from being really well behaved to one reaching for my fist with his mouth. While the woman is helping us check out, another dog starts running through the store and is being destructive. The man who is her husband and owns the shop with her comes out from behind the desk and goes after the dog to get him and rangle him back behind the desk along with the other one. I look at the tapestry and it\\u2019s no longer a rug, now it\\u2019s a dead dog that has been taxidermied. Now I understand why the leather was so smooth and shiny - it was once a shiny short haired soft dog. I don\\u2019t want it anymore. She says it\\u2019s really good for spellwork, protection and keeping the negative energies at bay. The man comes back and says, \\u201cYes it\\u2019s such a shame, the three dogs used to be a crew together. It\\u2019s a shame to see them separated now.\\u201d He is encouraging us to take it even though I\\u2019m apprehensive about having a dead dog in my house. Then there\\u2019s this yellow and white huge snake behind the counter next to the man. He taps the snake on the head and it starts to move. I can see its body starting to unknot from it\\u2019s sleeping position. It\\u2019s coming out from behind the desk and pushing the woman to the side. She stands back respectfully. I guess this is also one of their pets. The snake continues to unwind. The face kind of looks plastic but it\\u2019s acting real. I\\u2019m making sure to get out of the way. I\\u2019m trying to leave the shop and my husband is on the other side of the snake, also trying to get out. The snake continues to unwind and as it does, it is so huge, there is no tail in sight. Its body is filling every part of the shop. I can see the man trying to pull the snake back. I can see my husband trying to push through the body of the snake and trying to get out. Just as we reach the threshold, I see the snake open her mouth really wide and I see her fangs and tongue. The tongue is yellow and white and in the same pattern as the body. We get out.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house that looks a lot like my grandmother\\u2019s house except the ceilings are really, really high. It\\u2019s like a modular home. I\\u2019m with my mom in the kitchen and my dad somewhere and my sister somewhere. My aunt is there, too. I guess the whole family that usually gathers for Thanksgiving is there. My mom is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m with her and we\\u2019re baking bread. The counters are already covered with loaves of bread. It smells so good! There are some artisan loaves that we\\u2019re just finishing up. We\\u2019ve just tried this new style of baking and we\\u2019re looking forward to trying it. I take those loaves out of the oven and place them on the counter. We slice some pieces of bread, sampling different loaves for the meal we\\u2019re preparing. I step out of the kitchen and walk down the hall. I go into my grandmother\\u2019s bedroom. This is when I notice the ceilings are really high and there\\u2019s a loft. Also, her bedroom is on the opposite side of the hall than it was in waking life. There\\u2019s a wall partition and around the corner is a big green bed, her bed. There\\u2019s a little area with toys - a little kids table and bright primary colors, a little hammer, balls and art supplies. She set it up for the grandchildren to play with. I see my aunt up the ladder on the loft preparing a couple beds for the family to sleep. There\\u2019s also a bed downstairs with a pink bedspread. We\\u2019re preparing the house so everyone can rest. I go out and see my sister and grandmother in the laundry room, which she also didn\\u2019t have in real life. They\\u2019re taking Christmas decorations out of boxes. They\\u2019re taking out candy canes that are individually wrapped in plastic, then wrapped again in bunches. My sister and grandmother are taking the candy canes out - they\\u2019re all different colors, rainbow, blue, purple, solid red. I don\\u2019t see the traditional red and white striped candy canes. It\\u2019s so good to see my grandmother even though I only see her from behind. It feels like Thanksgivings and Christmases in the past.\"],[\"We\\u2019re in the Prizer\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the middle of the night and we\\u2019ve let ourselves in. Everybody in the household is asleep except for their youngest son. This must be years ago or time has shifted because he\\u2019s a little boy and not a young man. The house is in disarray. There must have been a big party the night before. We\\u2019re not supposed to be here but we wanted a place to rest that was warm inside. We expected that we could probably slip in after the party and no one would know because they would be sleeping deeply. The little boy has curly red hair. He\\u2019s in the pantry hiding and he sees us. Then other people in the household start to stir. We try to sneak away, but then Mrs. P comes downstairs into the kitchen. She\\u2019s obviously surprised but too polite to say anything or question us because she thinks maybe her husband invited us to stay. I\\u2019m in the kitchen helping clean up and making myself look useful or invited or hired to help clean up after the party. My husband slips away and goes down the driveway. It\\u2019s still dark and now it\\u2019s raining. He sets up the car top tent. I\\u2019m able to sneak away eventually. I think I\\u2019m upset that he\\u2019s upset. I kick the ladder of the tent and shake the tent a lot to make him wake up. He\\u2019s not happy that I\\u2019ve woken him. But I feel like we have to get going.\"],[\"I\\u2019m giving a session to Gemma outside in a courtyard. There\\u2019s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He\\u2019s good friends with Gemma, maybe they\\u2019re lovers. I\\u2019m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she\\u2019s going to the dinner later. I\\u2019m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, \\u201cThank you, that was really great.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting feedback but there isn\\u2019t time. Some other things happen and it\\u2019s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can\\u2019t come in because he\\u2019s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It\\u2019s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I\\u2019m not quite sure what they are because they\\u2019ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn\\u2019t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn\\u2019t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they\\u2019re much larger than me. I\\u2019m either really far away or I\\u2019ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I\\u2019m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It\\u2019s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It\\u2019s an ornate room with wood floors. There\\u2019s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they\\u2019re going to trap me, I\\u2019ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month\\u2019s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I\\u2019m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it\\u2019s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn\\u2019t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji\\u2019s ashram comes in and she\\u2019s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I\\u2019m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn\\u2019t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019ve been banished and will never be able to return. You\\u2019re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.\\u201d She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.\\u201d She laughs. I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don\\u2019t realize that I\\u2019m the one who took the entire community\\u2019s water.\"],[\"It\\u2019s just sort of a grey light. There are people sitting in chairs spaced for social distancing and scattered around. Somebody is sitting up front pointing an old wrinkled finger at people. Each time the finger points, the person is recognized as empathetic and kind. This finger is pointing at each of the people in chairs. As the finger gets to me, they hesitate. I see Jeremy sitting up there with the old one and he whispers to him, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t point to her.\\u201d It\\u2019s really unsettling and disturbing to me. The old one\\u2019s finger does point to me and recognizes me as kind. I wonder why Jeremy is so bent on seeing me otherwise.\"],[\"I\\u2019m riding on a horse with a group of others. A woman and a young girl of about six or seven are riding on a horse together. The horses make a sharp turn and the woman and girl fall of their horse. The girl gets up on her own and seems fine. The woman needs more help.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a small airport waiting for my friend. There\\u2019s only one gate. One plane has already left. They\\u2019re calling up people who have asked for refunds for their tickets as well as people who have been reassigned to later flights. I go up and stand in line. People are crowded together, bodies pressed up against each other, and pushing up against the person at the help desk. I say, \\u201cBack up!\\u201d Then everyone remembers COVID and they organize in two lines, breathing quietly and in a more restrained way.\"],[\"I\\u2019m bleeding and it\\u2019s not my time to bleed.\"],[\"I\\u2019m supposed to co-teach a yoga class with Les. People have arrived at the hotel. I\\u2019m there and walking around the room talking to the students. Then I realize I\\u2019m wearing a short white cotton dress. The room is heating up for class. I realize I\\u2019ll sweat and this dress will be transparent and I won\\u2019t be able to demo in it. I look up at the clock and see that I have just enough time to slip over to the boutique and pick up some yoga clothes. When I get there, the people are really helpful. They give me a bodysuit. I slip it on but it doesn\\u2019t look good at all. It\\u2019s taking a lot more time than I expected and there aren\\u2019t many other appropriate options for my body or teaching. Then I find a little pair of stretchy corduroy shorts and a top. I pull them on and think it will do. I go back and when I get back, the class is almost over and I\\u2019ve missed the whole thing while I was trying to find appropriate clothes to teach in.\"],[\"I walk into a bar, sort of. There are a few guys, couples sitting on stools and one man behind the bar. All seem to work here. I sit on a stool and ask for a cup and hot water so I can make my own tea. My husband comes in and walks behind the bar. He\\u2019s casually leaning back against the bar and talking with the people. We all seem to know each other. I\\u2019m wondering where my son is. He comes in and passes through. Then I don\\u2019t see him for a while. I assume he\\u2019s with somebody who\\u2019s watching him. The guy from behind the bar comes over to my cup because I\\u2019ve asked him for a tea strainer. Instead of giving me a tea strainer, he pours warm milk into my cup. Then he pours a huge amount of loose tea, so much so that it is overflowing from the cup. I\\u2019m surprised and ask him what he\\u2019s doing. He says, \\u201cOh it\\u2019s really, really good tea. Just wait and see.\\u201d I think he\\u2019s ruined my cup of tea so I sit back and let it steep, whatever he\\u2019s done. I start to get worried because I haven\\u2019t seen my son in a while. I look around and see that he\\u2019s not in this room where I thought he was. I ask my husband if he\\u2019s seen him or knows who he\\u2019s with. He doesn\\u2019t know and he isn\\u2019t concerned. I\\u2019m looking around frantically and see a ladder to an upstairs loft. I think he might be up there. I climb up. On the upper floor are lots of beds separated by curtains, lots of cushions and pillows. I see a little girl curled up asleep. But I don\\u2019t see my son or anyone else. I\\u2019m getting more frantic and worried. I see a door that leads outside to this big grassy area. My husband comes up the ladder and asks me if I found him. We go out to the garden and are looking around. An older man comes strolling up to us. He asks us how we\\u2019re doing and wants to strike up a conversation. I\\u2019m not interested in pausing for a conversation because I need to find my son. My husband looks across the way and asks, \\u201cWhere is the most likely place he could be?\\u201d I see a big climbing dome and a lot of kids playing on a playground. We go running over there. I\\u2019m looking all around and calling for him. Finally I see him and I\\u2019m so relieved to see him. I pull him to me tight and I\\u2019m both angry and happy. Then, there\\u2019s an overlap with another dream layered on top of it. I find out Hanna and Shelly are moving and selling their house. I\\u2019m over there and I\\u2019m sad that they\\u2019re moving. I enjoyed living in the same town. Hanna pulls me to the side and says, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not actually moving from the town. We\\u2019re just selling the house and downsizing because we can get a really high price for it. We\\u2019ve found a smaller house.\\u201d Shelly is fixing up the well and has dug out a big hole beside it. I go inside to look around. I go into the bathroom and Hanna shows me some weights. She says, \\u201cShelly lost it and got really angry and threw the weights around.\\u201d I ask if they\\u2019re all okay. She says, \\u201cYes, we\\u2019re all fine. This just happens sometimes.\\u201d They are not planning on telling anyone about the details about their move because they don\\u2019t want that to lower the price that they can get for the house.\"],[\"There is a dance ritual to perform tonight. I\\u2019m up high on a mountain with a flat area, like a plateau with sheer cliffs rather than a mountain peak. Some structures have been built up here. The ritual is for the sun. i don\\u2019t know if the sun is setting or rising. It\\u2019s very dark. All I see at the horizon is an orange ball of light. There\\u2019s a change of plans. Now the ritual is happening in the pool. There are a lot of people. The only one I recognize is a mama friend. We talk on the steps leading into the pool. I don\\u2019t recall anything about the conversation or the ritual. I\\u2019m talking with Mary about human origins. She says something about the latest research and the shape of your legs. She says she can tell me about my origin by holding my breasts in her hands to weigh them and get a sense of them and me. I agree and shift my shirt and bra to the side. She does so. She says, \\u201cOh you are a brigar peggis mortae.\\u201d She steps back and points to these flanks hanging up on hooks. They\\u2019re samples of different species. She points to the one that is my origin. I can see that each of the forms have differently shaped acetabuli. I think, \\u201cOh! This shape is why I never could be a professional ballerina.\\u201d I see other shapes that would have allowed me a better turnout for ballet.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in underground baths of cement or rock. There are different rooms with baths carved into the rock face as well as sinks. There\\u2019s a long hallway with rooms off to the right. I go all the way down to the last room. There are no doors. I walk in and go to the sink. I look down to my left and see a big communal bath that has been drained of water. There are brightly colored square pillows arranged in a circle in preparation for a sound bath or meditation of some kind. Two people, a young man and woman, are sitting in the center with their backs to each other and their arms hooked. They look like the typical kind of people you\\u2019d see at Esalen before it became more popularized and fancy. They are startled when they see me and yelp and move away from each other as if being close to each other is not allowed and they don\\u2019t want to be seen breaking the social rules. I don\\u2019t care about the rules though. I go back out and see one of my patients walking down the hall with her child. She doesn\\u2019t have a child in waking life, but this girl is a toddler. There\\u2019s a black leather wallet on the ground being pushed to the side. It\\u2019s open and I can see folded bills and credit cards. I feel like I need to explain myself to my patient and let her know we didn\\u2019t quarantine because we were isolated while we were away. Then my son comes running down the hall. He\\u2019s wild and out of control like he\\u2019s been in waking life. It\\u2019s so hard to know what to do with him. Later in the dream I\\u2019m hiding out in the car, getting a moment to myself. My husband is dropping our son off at a communal outside area with green grass, dome huts and underground rooms, like a hobbit village. While I\\u2019m hiding out in the car, a family I know comes by and they knock on the window. They have two daughters, one the same age as my son and the other just over one. They say hi and ask if I\\u2019m coming. I shake my head and say no.\"],[\"We\\u2019re setting up for a day at the office, my husband and I. There are suddenly so many people. My husband has six or ten tables set up in a row and every table has a person lying on it. I have my four tables at the end set up perpendicular to his. The tables are really close together so I go to help him rearrange the tables, staggering them by pulling one forward and the next bag. The people stay on the tables while we\\u2019re doing this. Then I lie down on a table so he can check me before I start my day. It takes a really long time for him to get to me. By the time he takes care of me and I go to my people, two of the four are gone. They got frustrated with waiting and I can see why - it\\u2019s been about forty minutes and I\\u2019m running late. I work on the two people remaining then leave to go find the other two. One is in a building next door, it\\u2019s like a mall. She\\u2019s shopping for meditation cushions and some new clothes. We talk and things are okay between us - she just needed to run some errands, but she\\u2019ll come back. She tells me how she has a scholarship to study and they\\u2019re providing room and board for free. She\\u2019ll be staying at the tents. Whoever they are, they are extremely wealthy and they\\u2019re idea of camping is extremely nice. She shows me the camping setup. It\\u2019s a tall and long domed structure made of clay. The beds are set up on a long loft that goes across the entire length of the structure, and they\\u2019re actual beds, not sleeping bags. It\\u2019s warm, too. After the tour, we go down to the bottom floor. As we\\u2019re walking out, a whale is nudging her face through the doorway. Somehow, the structure has been built over deep water. So the whale is pushing her head out and agitating an elephant standing just at the other side of the threshold. I look up and see Kundry sitting atop the elephant. The elephant brings down her head and her trunk gets entangled with the whale. It\\u2019s hard to tell if they\\u2019re in conflict or greeting each other. Kundry is taken down and they get all twisted together. There\\u2019s another large grey animal getting involved, but I can\\u2019t tell what it is.\"],[\"There are four separate interrelated scenes - a really nice apartment condo by the ocean; a little Cobb style house that once belonged to Jeremy; a lovely home and office built around a tree at a retreat center; and a hospital in Hawaii. I am moving into a really nice condo. It\\u2019s modern with new appliances, white walls, high ceilings, big floor to ceiling windows with a view of the ocean from every room. The ocean is choppy and dark, but beautiful. I\\u2019ve never been to New England but it seems like the Atlantic ocean of the northeastern United States. The rent is extremely affordable and I\\u2019m wondering why. I\\u2019m living with a childhood friend (we really only knew each other when I was an infant and he was five) and another woman who comes and goes. We are learning how to live with each other, learning each other\\u2019s rhythms with cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and working. The refrigerator is full of delicious food - produce and prepared meals. I go to see where he is. He\\u2019s napping on a couch with a book across his chest. He has his head towards me then he senses that I\\u2019m there on the couch and he turns his body so his feet are towards me. His knees are open and I feel a warmth and desire awaken in my body. I crawl up towards him and it surprises us both even though there has been an attraction between our souls since the beginning of my life. We go into the kitchen and there is a tentative quality to our interaction now, feeling each other out and this new expression of our relationship. I wrap my legs around him and kiss him. Then for a moment he switches to my dad then switches back. That was weird. But there is a beautiful connection and fluidity in the way we are together. It\\u2019s as if we were made to be together, but waking life circumstances didn\\u2019t work in our favor. Then I learn that the reason this condo is so affordable is because there are cameras everywhere set to film us making love. It\\u2019s like a pornography studio. I don\\u2019t really know what to make of it. But I love being here at the ocean and with him, so it\\u2019s okay. Then, the dream shifts. I am walking by a little Cobb style cottage that was for sale, but now it looks like someone has recently bought it and moved in. I think this house once belonged to Jeremy and Zoe. It\\u2019s really crafty. There are waves carved over the mantel and the front door. It\\u2019s tan and brown, really of the earth. There\\u2019s a wooden fence all around and a little garden. Inside, a fire is burning in the fireplace. Herbs are hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is warm and carved of wood. Everything is just enough and just right. No one is home. I go in through the door in the back and am walking around, curious to see if it feels like home to me. In a way, it does. I make a cup of tea and sit in front of the fire. Then I get a sense that whoever lives here will be returning home soon, so I need to make it look like I wasn\\u2019t there, moving things back and covering up my presence. I leave and walk around the corner past the front. This is when I see this symbolic spiral wave over the front door and I can see through the door and walls to how the design over the mantel is a continuation of this design. I walk away into another scene. I\\u2019m with my mom, dad and sister. We are touring a gorgeous place with a real estate agent. It\\u2019s a home modeled around a huge tree. It\\u2019s built in the round, like a spiral. There\\u2019s a lovely glass sunroom that wraps nearly all around and a deck around that. When you walk in, there\\u2019s the tree trunk, a fireplace and a sitting area with long curving couches designed for this space. A doorway leads to a spacious bedroom which I don\\u2019t go into yet. The home spirals to the right to a beautiful kitchen with an island. It\\u2019s a community kitchen with a pantry stocked full. It continues into a laundry room and a room for the cats. As we are in the kitchen, another group comes in and goes upstairs. The real estate is angry because we now know how public this home is - anyone who lives at the retreat center has full access to this kitchen and to the offices upstairs. There is a recording studio and office with computers and printer upstairs. It is quite loud and we realize it won\\u2019t be a private home. We are still interested though. She shows us through the laundry room to the glass sunroom and cat walk that spirals around the front. It\\u2019s warm and bright and there is a cat lounging in the sun. I love it. She takes us upstairs to this beautiful office. Everything is furnished and lovely. We go back downstairs and into the spacious bedroom. I realize this is an apartment in and of itself. It\\u2019s big and open. There\\u2019s a fireplace where you can roast potatoes in the ashes. There are old fashioned iron stovetops with terracotta pots set on top to radiate warmth into the space. They are cooking a feast of roasted chickens and breads and other kinds of meat and vegetables. It smells so good. I tell my dad, \\u201cHow wonderful would it be to learn how to use these stoves and cook these gorgeous meals?!\\u201d I go down one step to look at the bedroom to see if it will be good for my husband, son and me. There\\u2019s a huge bed. The room feels spacious and it\\u2019s flooded with sunlight. I love it. On the far side of the bedroom is something like a clear plastic tent tarp. Through it I see seven beds lined up against the wall. They are covered with colorful pillows and it\\u2019s so bright and inviting. There\\u2019s a paper with instructions for how to set up the pillows so they all fit. I think how wonderful it would be to invite friends over. I want to negotiate with the realtor about renting just this part of the treehouse, not the whole place. She won\\u2019t get as much of a commission as she wanted, but maybe she\\u2019ll be happy to have something rather than nothing. As we are leaving, we are putting on our shoes on the deck just outside the front door. My dad is trying to be funny. We have the same kind of shoes - brown plastic slippers. He\\u2019s trying to put on one of my shoes but it of course doesn\\u2019t fit. I tell him to give me back my shoe. Then I\\u2019m in a hospital in Hawaii. I\\u2019m partially in a room with a curtain and partially outside. My best friend from middle school is giving birth. They are torturing her, pushing on her stomach, squeezing and twisting. She\\u2019s in so much pain. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do it that way! You\\u2019re hurting her and the baby!\\u201d I think the baby is dead inside her. She\\u2019s exhausted. I\\u2019m also pregnant and giving birth. I won\\u2019t let anyone touch me. I feel my own stomach and the baby\\u2019s head is down and to the left and okay. I\\u2019m watching people rush around because this is an emergency room. A friend from college, is the doctor. I ask him to check me because I think I can trust him not to harm me or my baby. He approaches me tentatively. He is still unsure of himself around me because I rejected him so many years ago. He has a butter knife with what looks like raw ground beef on it. He puts a towel over me and checks. He brings the knife up and there is blood dripping from it onto his nose. There\\u2019s a look in his eyes like, \\u201cThis could have been my baby.\\u201d He is sad about the loss of our friendship and his desire to be in relationship. The labor is continuing and getting stronger. I look out into the city scene. It\\u2019s mostly grey and full of the sounds of a busy city. Through the grey I see bright red and yellow, the colors of Hawaiian royalty. The Hawaiians have joined together with their drums and are playing the rhythm of life, birth and death. I drum along with them on my belly as if my tummy is an ipu. I see one man stand up above the rest with his drum and he\\u2019s so full of vitality and passion. The passion and rhythm are in such contrast to the city, but this is what I tune into - the red and yellow and drums.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving across the Golden Gate Bridge. It\\u2019s been remodeled and this road is higher than the older road. People go really fast across, one car at a time. There are plastic bumpers on the road. It kind of also reminds me of the Pensacola Beach bridge. It\\u2019s a bit dangerous because of the speed and height, and there are only minimal guy wires on either side with a lot of strong wind. We barely stay on the road. We are trying to escape something. In another earlier time in the dream, I\\u2019m in a cozy house. I\\u2019m giving a healing session to a contemporary dancer. Her body is very slight but strong. As I begin working on her, she\\u2019s lying next to the fireplace on a folded blanket. Her body moves a lot and she leaps off onto a yoga mat. Then at one point her physical body is kneeling next to mine and we are both working together on her energetic body. The yoga mat leaps away as if her energy body is full of electricity and vitality. We look at each other and laugh with joy at the power of life. As we finish up, she asks for the time. It\\u2019s 9pm and it\\u2019s time for her to go to rehearsal. She gets up and leaves quickly. I follow her out because I need to go somewhere. She goes into the house next door. I\\u2019m surprised because I thought it was empty - the family living there just recently moved to a bigger, nicer house. Maybe she\\u2019s renting it while it\\u2019s waiting to sell. The house next door to that one is owned by a family with a few kids. They\\u2019re getting into their van. I see my son running past their house on the sidewalk and to the corner intersection. I\\u2019m running after him so he doesn\\u2019t run into the road. Everyone in the family has a long carrot tied to their noses and they look like Pinnochio noses. I think it\\u2019s odd, but just yell hello to them as I run after my son who is wild and excited. Then in an earlier part of the dream, I\\u2019m on a college campus. Liam is part of this mission. We\\u2019re tracking a woman who disappeared a long time ago. We\\u2019ve tracked her down into a basement. We go down and people haven\\u2019t been here for a long time, but there are a lot of cats roaming around. I see a movement in the corner and it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s a young woman with brown skin and she\\u2019s only wearing a bikini bottom. She\\u2019s forgotten how to be human. She\\u2019s moving and making sounds like a cat. In order to get close to her, I remove my clothes, all except my bra top and I move around like a cat, too. I\\u2019m speaking to her, cat to cat. She begins to come out but then gets frightened and returns to the shadows. This happens for a while. I\\u2019m conscious of Liam watching me move. I have to move quickly and sensuously to appear like a cat and to avoid all the fallen dusty and broken objects that have been here for ages. We finally catch her and bring her upstairs to the light and human world. Now I need to meet up with friends. I\\u2019m on a motorcycle and driving down a dirt trail. Then I realize I\\u2019m lost and it\\u2019s getting dark. I can hardly see the path and I\\u2019m getting worried. The motorcycle turns into a bicycle. I\\u2019m trying to ride on these dirt paths and am frightened because I\\u2019m lost and it\\u2019s dark and I\\u2019m far out in the woods. Somehow I turn around and find my way back. I leave the bike at the base of some stairs and walk into the lobby of a large building. Friends from my current hometown are all gathered and seem to be waiting for me. Everyone inside has a mask and they are looking at me with scorn because I\\u2019m breaking the rules. I try to pull my scarf up over my face and I see other people pulling their shirts over their faces so they can quickly pass through the building and get to the other side. I join my friends and we circle up to prepare for our trip. We\\u2019re looking forward to being away from here and able to gather without our masks on.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a big theater, like where they host the Grammys. Every seat is occupied. I\\u2019m sitting near the front at the far left with a small group of people, including JP Spears the comedian with a YouTube channel who has swung pretty disturbingly really far left, borderline Q. I don't\\u2019 recognize anyone else in my group from waking life. He\\u2019s put together a routine for us to perform with him. I\\u2019m his assistant. He is telling me about the routine where he\\u2019ll make someone float and make them appear to be him. The person he points out is a young girl with long red hair like him. She is unconscious or asleep. We go up the stairs to the stage and he places her on a table. He tosses a blue blanket over her naked body. I\\u2019m concerned for her modesty and adjust the blanket as he begins the show. He begins the act and somehow he raises her from the table so she\\u2019s floating in the air. This is supposed to be the peak of the performance. There was another part where he made other images of himself, one where he is an older version of himself with a bulbous nose and greying hair. At the end of the routine there isn\\u2019t a lot of applause and we all return to our seats. Other presentations continue on the stage. JP Spears is now lying across the top of the seats in front of me. There is a guy sitting to my right who was somewhat attractive. It looks and sounds like they are masturbating each other. They are breathing heavily. It\\u2019s disturbing and disgusting. I lean in a bit to see if they\\u2019re actually doing what I think they\\u2019re doing. JP Spears cums in my face and I\\u2019m utterly disgusted now. It gets in my eye and mouth. I get up and leave right away. I\\u2019m deciding what to do and where to go now. I don\\u2019t know who to report them to, or if I should. I\\u2019m outside the theatre. It\\u2019s dark and raining. I\\u2019m trying to find a car to get back home. I don\\u2019t have a home here in this place. So I\\u2019m trying to figure out where to go. Later in the dream I am in a house that I\\u2019m sharing with my sister and a woman from my current hometown - she and I do the same kind of work, and we\\u2019re sharing a room. My sister has her own room. I can\\u2019t fall asleep so I get up and wander around the house. The house is a mess with partially unpacked boxes and piles of clothes everywhere. I feel bad about this chaos and how sloppy I am. I just don\\u2019t have the energy to put the house in order and it\\u2019s also nighttime. She is awake reading, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a good idea to make a bunch of noise trying to clean up. I walk past the kitchen and my parents walk in through the door. They are returning early from a trip to the Big Island. They had plans to go on island tours and enjoy the island. They were at dinner and a Senator approached them and told them it was pleasant to see them, but with COVID still actively spreading, they should go home. This is not the time for vacationing. They tell me they were able to catch an early flight. My mom has brought my sister and me some new clothes and jewelry. She has laid out an outfit on the ground - a Christmas sweater that lights up and belonged to my grandmother, jeggings and a gold necklace. My dad has set out guacamole and tortillas for a midnight snack. I eat it and feel better. I get a call from Edward to prepare for a Zoom meeting with a woman who has been working with us. He wants me to find the contract so he can graciously thank her for her help, knowing exactly when she started working with us. I am looking through emails to find the contract but am not sure if that was the exact start date. The first email introduction was sent on October 24. We get on Zoom and she\\u2019s calling in from a kids pool. She\\u2019s on a playdate with her grandchildren and some others. She has her feet in the water with them and they\\u2019re all having a wonderful time splashing and playing on the slides.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, everybody is stuck repeating their same dream over and over and over again. This is the thirteenth night. We\\u2019re all having our own dreams, but they overlap in places where we have encounters with each other. The main place where my dream overlaps and encounters others\\u2019 is at a really small airport. The main person, the dream is interacting with is Rose and people from her dreams. Each time this interaction of dreams happens, there is an opportunity to figure out why the repetition is happening. Between the two of us, we have a chance to interrupt the continued repetitions and be free. This time around, Rose shows up while I\\u2019m waiting in line for my ticket. She\\u2019s wearing fitness clothes for pole dancing - little shorts and a tank top. She has a workout bag full of clothes and toiletries. She\\u2019s waiting for a plane, but so far in all the dreams the plane has never come. I\\u2019m in this airport also waiting for a plane or maybe a train. It's dingy in here and there aren\\u2019t any windows. There\\u2019s a round table that reminds me of the ones at my high school cafeteria. There is stale coffee in styrofoam cups and the wooden sticks to stir in fake sure and half and half, but no food. We\\u2019re all waiting in line for our tickets then going back to the table to wait more. One of the owners of the pole dancing studio shows up with her husband. She\\u2019s wearing a grey sweatsuit, but still looks sexy with her hair and makeup done just right. I feel self conscious and awkward because I recognize her but am not sure if she recognizes me or if she does, if she remembers my name. This happens to me in waking life because I have a good memory for people\\u2019s faces and names, but there are people who I must introduce myself to time and time again because they seem to have no memory of me. She and Rose and a few others are sitting together at one of the tables. It\\u2019s grimy because it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned well in a long time. There\\u2019s trash on the floor and the trashcan nearby is overflowing. Rose gets up and goes to the bathroom to change. She comes out in a black tank top, black pole dancing shorts and black heels. She\\u2019s extra tall. I\\u2019m walking next to her and feel short and frumpy because she is over six feet in her heels and lean, where I am short and deconditioned. We walk to a shower room that\\u2019s like a truck stop shower. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cViviane, we\\u2019ve gotta figure out how to get out of here. Tell me what this dream sequence means.\\u201d She thinks that if we can find out what it means, we will be free. I can\\u2019t recall what happens, though I know we are discussing the dreams.\"],[\"I was heading in to teach several thousand people.

I was keeping my eye out for it and at a certain point it got locked in the closet with Annette\\u2019s two cats who are really big and they hiss a lot at my cats. I was like, \\u201coh no!\\u201d and I went in and grabbed her and her cats ran out and I was making sure she hadn\\u2019t been attacked, but she looked okay. I was checking her for flees because we literally just got her off the street and saved her. She was just this small cute little kitten. At some point, my ex was in the dream and I was helping him get an apartment and trying to get him to film regular classes.\"],[\"I was at a castle/hotel, but it was in the rock - it reminded me of something from Lord of the Rings. It was a great grand palace and Tamar managed it. I was there with Carrie. We were checking it out and Sabrina was having a gathering. A big group was coming and there were a lot of famous people, celebrities and musicians. I wasn\\u2019t invited, but I was just checking out the place. I had my crystal with me. We go into the temple space and I see crystals inside the walls. One of them matches mine and looks just like mine. I put my crystal up to it to see. Then we needed to go, so we left, but I realized I left my crystal. But I think it was taken. So we go back to find my crystal and we see that Sabrina has it and she\\u2019s doing something with it to take the power and energy out of it. I send Carrie to go get it because I don\\u2019t want Sabrina to see me. But I can see through Carrie\\u2019s eyes or something. I can see what\\u2019s happening. So when Carrie sees it, she gets really upset and she goes to try and get the crystal. But she doesn\\u2019t have enough power to battle Sabrina. So I step into Carrie and Sekhmet\\u2019s in me. I essentially battle Sabrina. to get my crystal back. I am just as powerful as Sabrina, if not more powerful. I can match her power but not in a dark way. The whole time, Carrie thinks she\\u2019s the one who's battling, and Sabrina does, too. They don\\u2019t know that my power went into Carrie. Sabrina is shocked that it\\u2019s Carrie.

I pul us in and lose the door and it secures. We just make it as this wave goes by. I notice when we\\u2019re in there that there are no windows and I guess this is why we were safe. It may have been a gymnasium, all concrete with no windows and huge. I\\u2019m not sure if anyone else was in there. It\\u2019s possible there were a few others, though. It was definitely not a full building. I feel like when I pulled her in, I ran her up some stairs so we could go up a few levels, but it\\u2019s vague. We are in the right place at the right time for having just walked by this building when this tidal wave was coming. If we were anywhere else we would have been caught in it. Towards the end I\\u2019m like, okay, when we walk out, everybody will have died. There\\u2019s no way anyone survived that. We hadn\\u2019t gone back out yet, I was just bracing myself for going out to see what happened.\"],[\"I woke up to a woman singing. She was Asian. She had an amazing voice with fantastic range.

He was there and I saw something with our names on it. I asked someone, \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d It turns out he has really been into me this whole time and I was totally baffled since he acted so weird in real life. In another dream, I bought my mom a beautiful peacock necklace. But it was too expensive so I bought it for her. I also bought an expensive new pair of jeans. Then I was in some swimming pool place where they had classes for kids. The classes were listed. They were normal classes. Then all of a sudden I see one listed that said, \\u201cJungian Archetypes\\u201d and thought that was a random class to have for children at a pool. Then there was an image of a cow having a baby calf. Then at a certain point I was on a toilet with a magazine telling somebody to please leave. Then there was a giant water sprayer.\"],[\"In my dream there were all these boxes with glass starts in them. They were the stars in the sky.

And I said, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that! You could break it!\\u201d He was just being a jerk. I moved it, but then he did it again and was being an asshole.

I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh great, this is it, I guess I\\u2019m going to die.\\u201d The wave came and it took me under. I expected it to toss me around and I figured I was going to whack on the rocks. But I didn\\u2019t. I was just suspended. Then I came back out of it and was fine. I was like, \\u201cHuh. But where is my daughter?\\u201d I don\\u2019t think she was with me at first, but I knew she was there on the beach or something. So I\\u2019m looking for my daughter and I can\\u2019t find her. I\\u2019m freaking out. I\\u2019m running around and sobbing and calling for her. I see some teachers from her old school and they don\\u2019t look all that concerned.

The dark twin is born on June 24 when the sun stops standing still and starts to descend, and the light twin is born on December 25 as the sun stops standing still and starts to ascend. In the dream, there was something about that opposite birthday and there was someone I needed to find with that birthday, like we were connected in some way.\"],[\"I saw a lot of white and baby blue Porsche Cayennes in a parking lot.

I gave them some food and they were wolfing it down because they were so hungry. When I went to the poop box to check the poop, it was disgusting and there was stuff clumped everywhere. I was scooping it all out, but there was so much in it that I let it go. The amount I was seeing didn\\u2019t make sense because it felt like how much a cat would do in a week, not a day and a half. I felt super bad that I completely forgot about her cats.\"],[\"I had a dream of Arawn but cannot remember the details.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to get two cats that I had dropped off.

We were going along a flat bottom and up these metal stairs up to a door that led into the check in area of a hotel. In the basement was a black panther mother and a black panther child and another big cat that I couldn\\u2019t see but knew was there. We were trying to get through and up and out. We were concerned about these predator cats. They didn\\u2019t chase us, but we were running up the stairs and freaking out. There was a code on the door and I was like, \\u201cOh god, I hope I know the code.\\u201d I knew it, which was totally random. We got into the center of the hotel and I was telling the manager about the predator cats in the basement.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of \\u201chouse,\\u201d but I can\\u2019t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we\\u2019re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can\\u2019t live on Gaia anymore and it\\u2019s not worth the effort to try to save her. She\\u2019s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.\"],[\"There are just snippets of this dream that came through. I\\u2019m in the kitchen of my childhood home trying to put dishes away and reorganize the cabinet. My sister\\u2019s there with me. She\\u2019s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she\\u2019s always playing the victim. Then I\\u2019m in a house - it\\u2019s close by my childhood home. There\\u2019s a man living in it who\\u2019s apparently my significant other, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There\\u2019s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he\\u2019s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I\\u2019m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I\\u2019m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There\\u2019s an opera house. It\\u2019s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I\\u2019m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I\\u2019m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There\\u2019s all kinds of magical things in them. It\\u2019s dark up in here and I\\u2019m looking through them. Then I decide it\\u2019s time to leave. Now I\\u2019m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I\\u2019m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There\\u2019s so much snow and I\\u2019m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I\\u2019m driving down, there\\u2019s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn\\u2019t I stop to let them go by, don\\u2019t I know that pedestrians have the right of way. I look at them and I look ahead of me where there\\u2019s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It\\u2019s a small street, I\\u2019m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I am in a school, parts of it look like my old high school and the people I\\u2019m with feel like my old classmates. I\\u2019m teaching and it feels like what I\\u2019m teaching is very basic - it\\u2019s stuff that most people already know, although my classmates don\\u2019t seem to know it. I leave the classroom that I\\u2019m in and head outside. There\\u2019s a bunch of kids - they\\u2019re younger than me and they\\u2019re not particularly friendly. It\\u2019s definitely a clique and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re showing off and I don\\u2019t really feel welcome, so I leave and head to this classroom where another young woman is teaching and I love what she\\u2019s teaching. It\\u2019s all new and I\\u2019ve never run into it before, but it makes perfect sense and it\\u2019s a type of sociology about the way humans interact and how we communicate and can have adult mature conversations. The kids in this clique are in there, kind of, but they\\u2019re acting like they\\u2019ve heard all of it even though it\\u2019s all new to me. I\\u2019m just noticing the difference between my classmates who I was teaching who are older and these younger kids who seem to already know a lot and are very aloof. I sit down and have a conversation with the teacher who is maybe a little bit younger than me but not by much. She tells me about this raincoat or jacket (I forget the name she called it), but she\\u2019s showing me this things she\\u2019s wearing and it looks like a snakeskin where she cut a slit through the side of the body and can fit her head into when she puts it on it actually expands out and her arms go - one side goes down into the tail and the other side goes down into the head and expands and lifts up and out. It covers her like a cape, but when she takes it off it goes back into its snakeskin size and she just curls it up and puts it in her bag. I\\u2019m totally fascinated and she very much loves it and likes talking about it. She says it\\u2019s a lot like the capes that the Scots used to wear. I don\\u2019t know what that means. I take her word for it. And then it\\u2019s time for us to leave this classroom. We\\u2019re going to a competition of sorts. She and these standoffish kids and me and some of my friends who are going to be performing, we get in the back of a truck/wagon and we\\u2019re on our way. The standoffish kids are down at the bottom and even though it\\u2019s a celebration, they are not drinking any alcohol. The friends around me, they have all of their instruments and supplies, and they keep talking about the alcohol they\\u2019re going to drink, and I don\\u2019t want to. I think, no, we don\\u2019t want to drink, it makes us poor players, it makes us so we can\\u2019t compete very well. We won\\u2019t win. One of them starts to pass around a bottle of champagne and I say I don\\u2019t want it. I stick a cork in it, but the cork won\\u2019t stay - the fizzies keep popping it off. Somebody else comes in and says, \\u201coh there\\u2019s a way to make a cork that will stay but you have to know the magic.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t seem to know it. I don\\u2019t like it anyway. I just keep thinking that if they start drinking, we won\\u2019t be able to compete and those other kids will win the competition. It seems so off to me that alcohol is still available anyway. We arrive at the carnival/festival/competition place we were heading to. There\\u2019s a big outdoor tent. It\\u2019s kind of dark and gloomy throughout this whole dream - not a lot of sunshine. The younger kids go off and set up their project or their music or whatever it is. Me and my companions also set up our space. What I notice is there\\u2019s not a lot of help getting it set up. I can tell I\\u2019m doing a lot of work. We have some sort of booth and people are coming by. We are explaining to the judges what our booth represents - what all the things we\\u2019ve set up are for. There\\u2019s this feeling that is not quite up to snuff or up to par - it\\u2019s not what\\u2019s needed right now. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re showing or doing is 2 or 3 steps behind whatever those kids are setting up or doing - just like in the school where they seemed 2 or 3 steps ahead in their courses already even though I was a teacher that was teaching to my peers. The fair thing is over now and it\\u2019s time to clean up and clear off the table. All of my friends leave and leave me to do the cleaning up for myself. I\\u2019m distraught because I\\u2019m supposed to go with those younger kids wherever they\\u2019re going. That teacher is with them and she\\u2019s beckoning me to come with, but I don\\u2019t go because if I don\\u2019t clean up, nobody else will and I\\u2019m the only one who knows where everything goes anyway.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a condo - it\\u2019s huge. There\\u2019s a huge kitchen. The living room is gigantic. The bathroom has two separate showers. There\\u2019s a balcony that I walk out onto and can see the ocean from it. I live in this condo with my kids. They\\u2019re not here with me right now, but I feel comfortable here. All of my stuff is in the condo. Now my ex is here with me and we\\u2019re being cordial with each other. He\\u2019s actually even really friendly and seems happy to see me. I notice he has some of his stuff with him and it bothers me that he\\u2019s brought it and put it into the condo. This condo is one that I received in the divorce and yet somehow he is able to buy it and take it for himself. I\\u2019m not clear on why he\\u2019s even there, except that all of a sudden, I can feel that his energy is moving into this place with me. I decide to go take a shower and he decides he\\u2019ll go take a shower, too. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near me and I don\\u2019t want him to see me naked. I go to take a shower and his desk and other office stuff is in the shower stall so I can\\u2019t get in. I\\u2019m really mad because I did not say okay - I did not say it was alright for him to move his stuff in there and to be in this place. I\\u2019m starting to get agitated and his demeanor is changing from one of kindness and being happy to see me to really domineering. I ask him to take his stuff out of the shower, but it\\u2019s taking him forever, so I just decide not to and I leave. Then I say, \\u201cYou know we have to have the conversation because this isn\\u2019t what I want and this isn\\u2019t true and this isn\\u2019t going to last. Now he gets really shut down. We actually walk out of the condo into a lobby type area that\\u2019s part of the complex. There\\u2019s a huge Christmas tree in the lobby area. We can see out to the ocean from where we\\u2019re standing. I tell him I don\\u2019t want him living with me or in my space and that he needs to leave. But he tells me that he owns the condo and it is his now and that I can\\u2019t stay there. We go back up to the condo and I\\u2019m racking my brain because I don\\u2019t have any place to go. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to go and I don\\u2019t have any money. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to live where the kids can be with me. I start to pack up all my stuff and as I\\u2019m doing so, his girlfriend comes in. We sit down at the table in the kitchen. It\\u2019s an oval table with a couple of leaves in it. The chairs don\\u2019t match. In fact one of the chairs is a lot shorter. It kind of makes me laugh, but I don\\u2019t sit in that one. He tells me that he now owns the condo, that it\\u2019s his place and he\\u2019s going to share it with the girlfriend. I ask him how much he pays every month and he says they split the $5,000 monthly mortgage. I know that is not something I can pay. I see that the kids - her kids and our kids - are there and they\\u2019re running around. They\\u2019re happy to be in this space. I know I\\u2019m not going to live there with them. So I gather as much of my things as I can and I leave. I don\\u2019t know exactly what I\\u2019m going to do. I know the kids are okay for now, so that\\u2019s alright. As I walk out the front door, he walks with me and he\\u2019s essentially escorting me out and off the properties. We\\u2019re walking through this neighborhood that looks really familiar and I realize I\\u2019ve been in this neighborhood before. Down at the end of the neighborhood is a crystal mine. I\\u2019ve been to this crystal mine before and I can\\u2019t remember when or why, I just remember there\\u2019s crystals there. We walk by a house whose roof is being replaced. The woman who owns the house is on top of it and the roof is being replaced with large large tumbled crystals. They are huge stones and she\\u2019s sliding them into these lanes that fit on top of her roof. She\\u2019s about an eighth of the way done. I watch as she climbs down the ladder. She has these special shoes on and walks out to the crystal mine. My ex and I are still walking and we start to follow her. But I want him to leave because there\\u2019s no reason for him to be near me. Then the scene shifts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my ex again (this is the second night in a row). There is tension between the two of us. He says he\\u2019s moving and wants to take some of the furniture. We\\u2019re standing in the kid\\u2019s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it\\u2019s very dark in there. I see that there\\u2019s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don\\u2019t care if he takes them. There\\u2019s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I\\u2019m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I\\u2019m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I\\u2019m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I\\u2019m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I\\u2019m still a mother. I still have two children. They\\u2019re still with me. And my godmother says let\\u2019s just go. All of a sudden we\\u2019re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I\\u2019m starting to get upset because I realize we didn\\u2019t pack anything. There\\u2019s no food. There\\u2019s no water. I don\\u2019t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don\\u2019t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I\\u2019m sure. I say, \\u201cyes, we don\\u2019t have any of the things we need.\\u201d She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there\\u2019s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we\\u2019re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we\\u2019re heading back the other way. We\\u2019re all fine, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, \\u201c well, we\\u2019re going to take a shortcut.\\u201d And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He\\u2019s young - he\\u2019s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He\\u2019s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There\\u2019s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there\\u2019s display cases and a buffet table. I\\u2019m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don\\u2019t because I\\u2019m allergic to rice and I\\u2019m allergic to soy and I can\\u2019t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I\\u2019m heartbroken because number one, I\\u2019m starving, and number two, I haven\\u2019t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. There\\u2019s a building that looks kind of like a town hall you\\u2019d rent for a function, but it\\u2019s a bit grander than that. The patio area has these huge columns like the Roman columns you see in ruins. It\\u2019s night time. It\\u2019s dark out. There\\u2019s a lot of people I don\\u2019t know at the party, but there\\u2019s a lot of my classmates from high school there, too. We\\u2019re hanging out but I have this feeling of being the outsider and not really welcomed or not included somehow. I\\u2019m watching what\\u2019s going on and I\\u2019m trying to get the attention of my classmates but I\\u2019m awkward about it and I don\\u2019t really know how. Then one of my classmates who I\\u2019ve known since we were 8 sees me and hangs out together and kinda takes me under his wing. He\\u2019s showing me around this party - just the outside perimeter part, we still haven\\u2019t gone into any of the building. He\\u2019s getting really comfortable with me. His arm is around me and there\\u2019s this air of ownership almost. I do not like it. I remember when we were in high school and flashing back to when he was a little more touchy feely than I liked. I\\u2019m not excited that he\\u2019s doing that, but I also wanted to see everyone. Eventually I peel myself away. Then some sort of time goes by and I\\u2019m walking around this party and I realize there\\u2019s this point on one side where it was the outside of the party and there\\u2019s grass fields and trees. Time is going on normally. But there\\u2019s a partition and on the other side of this line, everything has been frozen. The people there are asleep. I realize that if I cross over this line and walk into it, I can see them, I can see that they\\u2019re asleep or frozen and I can also bring them out of it. When I do, six years has passed on one side of the line and no time has passed on their side. It\\u2019s very odd. They\\u2019re still who they were and time has gone on on the other side. The dreams shifts completely and my two children are with me. We are walking down to the beach. We walk down this path and on either side of the path are noni bushes - bushes I grew up with in Hawaii. As soon as I come out of the path onto the walkway that skirts the edge of the beach, a lifeguard greets me and says, \\u201chello, good morning, welcome.\\u201d I look up and it\\u2019s my ex boyfriend who used to be a lifeguard. I\\u2019m so surprised that he was so friendly to me. I say, \\u201chello.\\u201d He sees who it is and the friendliness disappears immediately. He says something nasty. I ask him if he\\u2019s still going to be mean to me and if he\\u2019s still mad at me. He says essentially yes forever. That hurt my feelings a little bit but I realized there wasn\\u2019t much I could do about that. He couldn\\u2019t keep me off the beach with the kids and we keep going. I see to my left a huge pool - an outdoor pool. Some of those same friends from the party are in the pool and I feel like I\\u2019ve been looking for them. I head their direction and the kids are with me, but again I feel this weird outsider feeling like I wasn\\u2019t quite invited and I\\u2019m going to be the weird kid that shows up at the party even though they weren\\u2019t invited. But I walk towards the pool anyway and both the kids get in the pool because they\\u2019re really excited to swim. I\\u2019m staying on the edge and all those classmates are ignoring me. But then they start playing with my son and teaching him how to jump in the pool. They continue to ignore me even though they can very clearly see me. My daughter is not excited about this either. She can see that there\\u2019s this outsider vibe going and she\\u2019s backing off and away, too. I\\u2019m trying to keep an eye on her and an eye on my son. Then we get out of the pool and begin to walk away. The awkwardness just gets to be too much. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I have a mentoring meeting with one of my clients. I\\u2019ve ridden my bike to her place and park it in the garage. She meets me there. We\\u2019re talking about whatever it is she needs to talk about it. We go upstairs into her apartment and we have our session. She\\u2019s talking about actually having another baby with her partner, which is a big deal because it would have to be in vitro fertilization. She already has another child who is a little bit older. At a certain point she has to go pick them up, so we end our session after talking. She goes into her bedroom and grabs another child - a younger child, a little black orphan baby that she has adopted. It was not an infant, maybe 3 or 4 or 5, had been sleeping in the bedroom the whole time and I didn\\u2019t know. She puts the child in a front carrier, straps in, and heads out. We\\u2019re both heading out back down the stairs from her apartment to her garage where my bike is and her car is. I\\u2019m just surprised that there was another child in the apartment the whole time and apparently sleeping, but it didn\\u2019t come up in our conversation either. I thought it was so strange. She goes out. She leaves with her other child to pick up her child from school. I get my bike and start riding it down the street because I\\u2019m heading towards an Imbolc festival. As I\\u2019m riding my bike, I get off and walk. I\\u2019m walking down the main street that I grew up on in my childhood. I\\u2019m seeing the mountains to my right - they\\u2019re beautiful, covered in green grass and I can see the tree line. Then of course I can see all of the houses - the regular neighborhoods that I passed every day in my childhood. I\\u2019m heading down to the high school I went to as I was growing up and that is where the festival is. So I cross the little bridge that has a stream under it and I take a right into the school and I make it right past the cattle gate into the main entrance and set my bike down. I also have this strange lingering feeling that I have my own children I\\u2019m supposed to be watching. They show up at the school and I take them in and bring them through the entrance where I pay for admission. My old mentor who I learned some of my priestessing skills in my priestess apprenticeship is there. She is there to take us all on a guided journey before I get into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s me and whoever else has shown up at the entrance of the gate, which I find interesting because she\\u2019s only taking the people who have been trained as priestesses to go do this meditation, and two of the other women that I see there - besides the women I went through the program with - are actually high school classmates of mine who tell me, \\u201cOh yeah, we started this program five years ago. We\\u2019ve always been priestesses.\\u201d I\\u2019m really shocked because I didn\\u2019t see them the entire time I was on the program and also I feel a little bit betrayed, like I had been told that the group of us that had been going through the program was it and to find out there were other people that we didn\\u2019t know about in our spiral is very disturbing to me. We lay down anyway and we\\u2019re going through this meditation. I can hear my mentor\\u2019s voice and she says very specific words, which I cannot remember now. But there\\u2019s also a part where she sprinkles turmeric and saffron over us - those are the two herbs we are meant to be using with this meditation. And then I can feel my body taking in the herbs, taking in the words - there\\u2019s definitely a change in what feels like my consciousness and my field. When it\\u2019s done, I get up and I know it\\u2019s time for me to leave. I\\u2019m not supposed to stay there with the other priestesses or the people she had brought in to do this blessing. I head into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s interesting, I can see yellow tulips everywhere. These tulips seem to be playing an important part of this Imbolc festival. Then I leave because I\\u2019m still so upset about these two women who were my high school classmates who also suddenly turned out to be these priestesses that I didn\\u2019t know that they were. They have some disdain and contempt for me because I had left the path early and I don\\u2019t like any of it. So I leave the festival and somehow the scene changes completely. I\\u2019m in a home with my mom and my dad and my dad is trying to keep the inside of the house - I think it was supposed to be my childhood home - he\\u2019s trying to keep it in order, keep it clean. My mom is in another section of the house - her office - and there\\u2019s her and a bunch of people in it and they\\u2019re all brainstorming jobs - how to work, how to make money. They\\u2019re making the assumption that I\\u2019m part of it, I\\u2019m going to start working it. But I\\u2019m actually in the office trying to brainstorm my own programs, my own classes, my own way to get more clients. They keep including me in their discussion and finally I get really pissed off and start yelling. I grab their papers they\\u2019ve been writing on and tear them up, rip them up. They finally say oh, okay, she\\u2019s not going to help with that and they go back to writing on their whiteboards brainstorming. I\\u2019m so annoyed that I get up and head out to a restaurant that they apparently also own. I can\\u2019t tell if both my parents own it or just one, but I go to the restaurant and there\\u2019s this pressure on me to help work in that restaurant too and I do not want to, but I do need money. So I go into the restaurant and it\\u2019s interesting because a different classmate is a server in the restaurant and there\\u2019s another man - two men are in there. They sit me down and they walk me through the way this restaurant works and how the emphasis is on kindness to the employees, which is so different from the restaurant experience I have where everyone is cutthroat and the chefs brandish knives at you and whatnot. So they are explaining to me how the restaurant works and how my duties would be as manager and how little I would have to do. I\\u2019m still not sold, I don\\u2019t want to work at a restaurant, I\\u2019ve already done that. While we\\u2019re sitting down at the meeting, people are coming into the restaurant and eating. Things are flowing. I can hear glasses clinking and silverware being used and orders being yelled out and lots of conversation. I look to my right and there\\u2019s this huge square table with 12 people sitting at it and they\\u2019re singing to a cat trying to communicate to the cat to do something. The cat is actually responding to it - it reminds me of snake charmers and all of these students know exactly what they\\u2019re doing. They\\u2019re communicating to this cat through singing, all 12 of them, and they are getting the cat to do what they want it to do and I\\u2019m just fascinated watching this happen. Then my attention goes back to the two guys I\\u2019m in the meeting with and I just tell them, \\u201cit\\u2019s lovely, you\\u2019re lovely, the restaurant seems lovely. The restaurant seems to run quite well, but I\\u2019m not interested. I don\\u2019t want to work in a restaurant.\\u201d Then the scene changes again, but I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest of the dream.\"],[\"So many different dreams. I just remember fragments. The first one is just me and a priestess sister and some other people I know. We\\u2019re going on a journey. We have a covered wagon that we\\u2019re getting ready to travel with. It\\u2019s a long journey and rather perilous on the one hand, and on the other hand, there\\u2019s still modern things available to us. In the dream I go through the whole journey but I can only remember the ending part where we have gone everywhere we need to go and are sitting at a kitchen table trying to weigh out sliced oranges and green beans to feed another child and the scale won\\u2019t work. One of my priestess sisters is on a couch behind me and she\\u2019s getting scolded by someone for saying that she wants to do a certain thing but then not doing it. She kept saying that she wanted to wear bright orange and red colors, but she doesn\\u2019t do it. In the dream, I feel like it is a metaphor for her expressing some part of herself or turning on some part of her magic that she knows she wants but she just doesn\\u2019t. I\\u2019m listening to the whole thing in a kitchen - it\\u2019s a kitchen that\\u2019s been part of the journey. I\\u2019m worrying that the person that\\u2019s scolding her is going to come scold me. The person scolding her sounds like James Earl Jones, he\\u2019s like a big black man with a lot of gravitas and authority and power. I\\u2019m nervous he\\u2019s going to come over and start telling me what I'm not doing right. Then the scene changes. We\\u2019re back on the covered wagon again and heading home, back to where we started from. We get there and there\\u2019s a huge barn (it reminds me of a barn raising, but the barn has already been built). Everyone\\u2019s getting ready to dance. It\\u2019s a weird mix of olden times where the women are wearing white caps on their heads and have these long full skirts and then some of them aren\\u2019t - some of them are dressed in club clothes, like they are going to a rave. Some of the participants I know from when I did Olympic weight lifting at my old gym. It\\u2019s a very strange mix of people. I\\u2019m still watching all of it. People are saying hello and welcome back from your journey, but there\\u2019s a part of me that\\u2019s very much the observer and not in the celebrations that are happening. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a wedding or just a party. There\\u2019s something going on. This fragment ends and the next fragment I remember is: a man is calling me on my phone. I had had a healing from him the night before. He calls me and says, \\u201cHello, this is Michael. Your healing was very interesting today. I put together a video for you to watch of what I healed.\\u201d But his connection is crappy and the video keeps freezing and I don\\u2019t get to see all the pieces. He recognizes this and says, \\u201cOh, I can see that the video won\\u2019t play. Let me just tell you.\\u201d Then he tells me, but of course now I can\\u2019t remember what he said! He had done the healing and things had come up and I was very surprised that he called me because I was supposed to call him. He was trying to emphasize that the healing was very significant, very interesting, and that I really needed to know and he wasn\\u2019t going to wait for me to call him. Then the scene switches again and I\\u2019m in another fragment of a dream. This time I\\u2019m riding in a vehicle and I\\u2019m watching a woman in front of me who is biking. She\\u2019s doing a long distance bike because she has big saddlebags and she has her dog with her. Something happens to the dog - she has to feed it or it gets something in its paw - and she has to stop and tend it. It\\u2019s a big black dog with curly hair. She spends a lot of time making sure the dog is okay - I think it is. The surroundings around us are so strange. It\\u2019s like the road is lifted up and elevated. Sometimes it\\u2019s sand on either side, sometimes it\\u2019s water, sometimes there\\u2019s a palm tree. It\\u2019s totally blue skies. It\\u2019s completely clear. It seems like some sort of paradise place, but there\\u2019s not a lot of greenery. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s not part of this realm and it\\u2019s really important for this woman to take care of her dog and it\\u2019s super important for me to witness it and I do not know why.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a dinner party of sorts - it feels like one of those social gatherings like an auction where they raise money for a cause. I\\u2019m sitting at a long table and there\\u2019s a Latino man to my left who is paying me quite a lot of attention, but my attention is focused on another group of people who are not sitting at a table - they are standing up and gathered in a crowd and they\\u2019re huddled somewhat closely together. Some of them are dressed as servers who are working this banquet dinner. Some of them are dressed as guests. The sense I\\u2019m getting is that they have something up their sleeve. They\\u2019re planning to do something and there\\u2019s definitely magic involved. I keep seeing little flashes or vignettes of little scenes where something is a little out of place and the thing that\\u2019s out of place has a red color and everything else in the background is its normal color. I\\u2019m not quite understanding everything I\\u2019m seeing, but I know that each of these little vignettes I see, one thing is going to trigger the next thing and it will be a sequence of events that creates this magic. I don\\u2019t even know what it is - it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s supposed to impact the way this auction dinner is going. This is taking up quite a bit of my attention until the Latino man on my left who has dark short cropped black hair, dark skin and a 5 o\\u2019clock shadow where I can see he has shaved but it\\u2019s not smoothe...He\\u2019s a little older than I am and he has leaned over to get my attention. He\\u2019s leaning over my left shoulder and it feels like his upper body is almost in my lap, but he\\u2019s still being very respectful, it\\u2019s not a pushy way, he just really is trying to get my attention. He says that he will protect me and love me no matter what, which I find a little unnerving because I don\\u2019t know who he is. This scene ends and it cuts away to me driving a car. I\\u2019m driving away from the dinner. I think it\\u2019s the next day because it\\u2019s light out and this was definitely a dinner happening in the evening. I\\u2019m driving to an errand of some sort and I can see that it\\u2019s sunny and it looks like I\\u2019m going the regular path I take to drive my kids to tennis. I\\u2019m on the phone with a girlfriend and I\\u2019m relating this story to her and I\\u2019m relating the behavior of this Latino man who, now that it\\u2019s the next day I feel like he was a kind of wizard of some sort or at least he had great magical power or he had the ability to at least take me out of whatever was going on. So I\\u2019m relating this story of my friend and I\\u2019m asking her what she thinks of it. She\\u2019s telling me that yes it was somewhat strange behavior but I could actually trust this man and I remember thinking, well, trust him or not, I don\\u2019t know why he said he was going to love me. There was no chemical attraction there at all. I just felt baffled by his behavior. But I start to feel strange talking about this on the phone the next day and I know that there is some sort of connection happening and it feels like there\\u2019s an alchemical process happening in my body as I describe it to my friend. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a coffee shop and I see a friend of mine who is working there. I haven\\u2019t seen her for a while. I ask if she wants to hang out but it feels strange. She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it\\u2019s not very big, there\\u2019s not a lot of space. She\\u2019s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I\\u2019m asking her while she\\u2019s busy, and it\\u2019s not that she doesn\\u2019t want to hang out. The scene changes and I\\u2019m in a residential area of a town and I\\u2019m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I\\u2019m walking up a hill and she\\u2019s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I\\u2019m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She\\u2019s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It\\u2019s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don\\u2019t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They\\u2019re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I\\u2019m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It\\u2019s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there\\u2019s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there\\u2019s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I\\u2019m a little bit wary because there\\u2019s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don\\u2019t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don\\u2019t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I\\u2019m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It\\u2019s actually another sort of twilight, but it\\u2019s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it\\u2019s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I\\u2019m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it\\u2019s cordial. Suddenly he\\u2019s talking to me like we\\u2019re still lovers. I\\u2019m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle.\\u201d The voice is also telling me, \\u201cYou can still be kind, you can still be kind.\\u201d So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he\\u2019s going to take me with him. So we\\u2019ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there\\u2019s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It\\u2019s where he lives. He has an apartment. He\\u2019s very very familiar with me and I\\u2019m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He\\u2019s a surfer and he\\u2019s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he\\u2019s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I\\u2019m actually quite glad that he\\u2019s going. So again, I\\u2019m being as encouraging as possible. I\\u2019m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don\\u2019t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I\\u2019m just sending him off for a little bit and then he\\u2019ll be back. But in my mind I\\u2019m sending him off like he\\u2019s going off on a quest and I won't\\u2019 see him for a long while. I\\u2019m relieved that I wont\\u2019 see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he\\u2019s really proud of. I\\u2019m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he\\u2019s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I\\u2019m satisfied with how I\\u2019ve handled all of it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people - I know some of them, they\\u2019re acquaintances that I\\u2019ve met here where I live, but we\\u2019re not close. We\\u2019ve met up and we\\u2019re going to a concert, but it\\u2019s music I don\\u2019t know or I don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not excited about it, but it\\u2019s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There\\u2019s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it\\u2019s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we\\u2019re listening, and I\\u2019m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I\\u2019ve met them before or they\\u2019re from some era of my past. We\\u2019re listening and while we\\u2019re listening there\\u2019s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it\\u2019s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m just sewing away and now it\\u2019s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can\\u2019t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I\\u2019m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don\\u2019t tangle my threads and it\\u2019s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I\\u2019m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I\\u2019ve been in a bowling alley. There\\u2019s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I\\u2019m just watching them bowl and they\\u2019re all having a really good time. It\\u2019s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I\\u2019ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It\\u2019s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it\\u2019s time for me to bowl. It\\u2019s not time because I\\u2019m part of their team or anything; I\\u2019m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I\\u2019m so terrible at it. It\\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. So, I\\u2019m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there\\u2019s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it\\u2019s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can\\u2019t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can\\u2019t go head on or straight. So it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there\\u2019s a person sitting in the way. So it\\u2019s my turn again and I go to him and say, \\u201cCould you please move so I can bowl correctly?\\u201d The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he\\u2019s watching me to see if I\\u2019m going to get it. There\\u2019s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I\\u2019m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it\\u2019s my turn and he\\u2019s not in my way, I go to bowl and it\\u2019s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It\\u2019s the most beautiful bowl you\\u2019ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the room of a house I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m there with, I think my ex, I\\u2019m not sure as the face flickers out. But I\\u2019m looking around and there\\u2019s a table, a desk, with an old stereo on it - it looks exactly like the one I had growing up in high school. It has a case and the case is not on it, so I put the case on like it\\u2019s supposed to be. There\\u2019s also a vase of flowers in the room - I don\\u2019t know if somebody gave them to me, or if they\\u2019re just there. I put them next to the bed on this tall nightstand. This whole time I feel simultaneously trapped and nostalgic. This old radio stereo makes me nostalgic for my childhood and yet I feel trapped in this room and want to get out of it, especially since it looks like my ex is in there with me. Then he says we have to go to dinner. I don\\u2019t want to because we\\u2019re not together and I have no idea why I\\u2019d go to dinner with him. But he says we have to go because we\\u2019re meeting clients of his. Now I\\u2019m really not wanting to because it\\u2019s a gross schmoozy dinner that I do not want to be a part of. He walks out the door and gets on a bike and starts pedaling through a crowd. I\\u2019ve followed him out and am watching him go. I\\u2019m really sad because I know that my legs and the muscles in my body are not as strong as they used to be and it\\u2019s going to be really hard for me to pedal that bike to follow him to this dinner party we\\u2019re going to. I can just feel how I don\\u2019t have very much strength in my legs and I used to have a lot. And it's making me really sad to know that I used to be a very strong bodied person and now I\\u2019m not. I follow him anyway on a bike. I stay behind him the whole way because I can\\u2019t keep up. We\\u2019re biking through crowds of people to get to this restaurant. I\\u2019m following along behind and he parks his bike and so do I. I see him talking to a host at the restaurant and telling him he has a table for four and I\\u2019m to follow. So I follow him to a table, but there\\u2019s enough distance between us that by the time I finally get to the table, he\\u2019s already ordered drinks and he has hor d'oeuvres coming and he\\u2019s on his second drink already. I go to sit down at the table, still very reluctant. There are other people who will join us. He has me try one of his drinks. It\\u2019s alcoholic and super sugary sweet gross, and I don\\u2019t want to taste it because I know alcohol is so bad for me - it will make me feel really badly really quickly and I hate that I\\u2019m here with him. It feels like I\\u2019m being made to perform the dutiful hostess while he performs the gross role of extravagant host. He\\u2019s ordering all the food and our guests are here now. It\\u2019s two different couples, both man and wife, female and male couples. They\\u2019ve sat down and my ex is getting loud and really arrogant and ordering the food for everyone. He\\u2019s ordering tapas for everyone but it has dairy or grain, which is all food I\\u2019m allergic to, so there's nothing for me to eat or drink. I\\u2019m trying to make small talk with these friends of his. The men are also gross and arrogant and the wives are too, but the one next to me is a little more subdued in her behavior and demeanor. She\\u2019s not loud and laughing. She\\u2019s more quiet and we are sitting next to each other. I feel a little connection with her, although at one point someone spills a cocktail all over both of us and it\\u2019s sticky and she\\u2019s laughing but I\\u2019m annoyed. Then somehow the dinner is over and the scene changes because now I'm off by myself. I\\u2019m really grateful to be by myself. I\\u2019m walking up through these hills and I can still see the restaurant I had been in, which is on a pier. I have an impression of the ocean that was part of the background of this restaurant. But now I\\u2019m walking through these smaller rolling hills - they\\u2019re all green. There are copses of trees and when I look up the hill, it\\u2019s thickly covered in forest, but I\\u2019m not in that thicker part yet. There\\u2019s a fire somewhere and now I\\u2019m following these men who are firefighters - they\\u2019re very burly, muscular and thick - cliche of a firefighter. I\\u2019m on stealth mode for some reason. I know I have to get to this fire to see what\\u2019s going on, but I don\\u2019t want to get in the way of the firefighters. So I'm following them, but being very sneaky and hiding behind some of the trees as I follow them to this road. I can hear dispatch giving them instructions to the road of how to get to the fire. I\\u2019m following along but sneaking behind everyone, though I can see everything playing out in front of me. Then I get to this place where I\\u2019m looking at the road and I can see the fire engines. It\\u2019s a dirt road, but there are houses along it. They are driving through neighborhoods, but where I\\u2019m standing, there\\u2019s a souvenir store like what you'd see at Disneyland to pick up Disneyland stuff. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what the souvenirs are, but it has that feel of a place where tourists come to spend money. I\\u2019m in this store but still watching what\\u2019s happening outside as the firefighters are heading towards this fire. All of a sudden, there is an assassination and I\\u2019m watching the person who is supposed to be doing the assassinating. I\\u2019m not entirely sure who he\\u2019s supposed to kill, but this person is an elf and has a silver bow that he\\u2019s going to do the assasination with. I\\u2019m watching him weave through the crowd and hide behind some of the displays in the shop. He finally gets his eyes on the person he\\u2019s going to assassinate. He puts his silver bow down next to him and it starts sliding away. All of a sudden the aisles in this store mimic the hills I\\u2019ve been walking on. This bow starts to slide away from him and somebody notices it and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you\\u2019re going to kill your target if your bow is sliding away.\\u201d He looks up and realizes that somebody else has been tracking him as he\\u2019s been tracking his target, and I\\u2019ve been watching all of this go on. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a commotion outside the store. The woman who had been sitting next to me at dinner is being attacked by someone - whether it is the assassin's target or not, I\\u2019m not sure, but I see her pulled behind the side of the building and then there\\u2019s screaming. I\\u2019m really worried at this point because it doesn\\u2019t seem like anyone is going to stop them, except maybe this assassin in front of me with his bow sliding away down the hill. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"There were many different parts to this dream - some of them in one of the houses I remodeled when I was younger and one in a larger home I don\\u2019t recognize. The section of this dream that stood out the most was towards the end when I was in a dorm room. I was so exhausted from everything I\\u2019d been doing and I just wanted to lay down and sleep until the graduation ceremony I was to go to. I laid down on what looked like a chaise lounge in a bedroom in a dorm room. There was another bed across from me. The entrance to the bathroom was in between the two beds. Although I was exhausted, I was aware, not awake, but aware, that a young man had come into the room and was also getting ready for the graduation. I\\u2019m also young - we\\u2019re both college aged. He\\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\\u2019ve ever seen, like from a different realm beautiful. That was the consensus all around, it wasn\\u2019t just my thoughts, the other women who were around thought the same. He\\u2019s being very considerate of the fact that I'm so tired and has not woken me at all, although I am still aware that he\\u2019s there, I\\u2019m still sleeping because I can feel the exhaustion dragging at my bones. There\\u2019s some sort of conversation he\\u2019s having with some other young women in the room about the plants, the flowers, that he has gathered for lies. He has a very magical quality about him - he seems very wise and ancient, like he knows a lot. So he\\u2019s explaining a little bit about why he\\u2019s picked plants for the leis for this graduation. He actually comes in and sits near me on my little bed, chaise-lounge, and is explaining one of the plants to some of the other women in the room, but I wake up at this point and as he\\u2019s explaining it, I\\u2019m looking at the plant. In the meantime, this beautiful young man creature is trying to get me to hurry because it\\u2019s time to get to this graduation. We haven\\u2019t been, but I\\u2019m just so mesmerized by all the different leis and necklaces in this box - there\\u2019s kukui nut leis and necklaces made of seed beds with over a hundred strands and they\\u2019re twisted together in pink and white and they\\u2019re heavy and gorgeous. But I know how much work has gone into making all these necklaces. There\\u2019s necklaces that have other polished crystal stones that look like pieces of peridot and darker stones, so maybe obsidian and onyx and those are single strands, but the stones are rather large. I start hanging them up in front of me. Suddenly these hooks appear and the hooks begin to fill with all of these necklaces and I\\u2019m running out of room for the hooks for the necklaces to hang. Also in the box is this huge ball of twine, but it reminds me of silk that you use to make necklaces with and it\\u2019s dyed a dark purple and there\\u2019s also beads that are not actually seeds from a plant about the size of those cilantro seeds. They\\u2019re dark brown and dried out with holes drilled through them. There\\u2019s a little package of them and it looks like 50 or so of them. I realize that I want to strand my own necklace with some of these seeds and make my own for part of the graduation although I have no time and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019d want to do that. I start to bead some of these seeds on the silk twine. I can hear myself say I can put them all on and the young man who is standing there gets a little upset with me and he says, \\u201cNo, those are too powerful. You only need 6.\\u201d I look at him and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s very adamant that I only need 6 on this necklace I\\u2019m making. So I stop. I have probably 10 or 12 on by now, but I stop making the necklace and I put it down. I realize I\\u2019m not going to have time to finish that necklace and I just need to pick one from all the ones I have and get to this graduation. Then the dream shifts and I don\\u2019t remember the rest.\"],[\"I only remember a snippet of this dream. I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It\\u2019s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I\\u2019m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It\\u2019s warm so I don\\u2019t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I\\u2019m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I\\u2019ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I\\u2019m headed back in their direction. As I\\u2019m walking down the street, I\\u2019m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There\\u2019s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there\\u2019s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there\\u2019s very tall windows - they\\u2019re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it\\u2019s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I\\u2019m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I\\u2019m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She\\u2019s talking to her daughter. She\\u2019s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there\\u2019s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that\\u2019s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I\\u2019m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I\\u2019m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There\\u2019s an awkwardness now because I don\\u2019t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She\\u2019s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I\\u2019ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I\\u2019m wearing doesn\\u2019t have any pockets and I also suddenly can\\u2019t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I\\u2019m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I\\u2019m so distraught and I wonder if it\\u2019s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don\\u2019t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It\\u2019s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There\\u2019s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody\\u2019s birthday, I\\u2019m not sure whose. Maybe we\\u2019re celebrating everybody\\u2019s birthday. We\\u2019re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There\\u2019s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we\\u2019re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I\\u2019m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I\\u2019m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I\\u2019ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s this man I want you to meet.\\u201d She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it\\u2019s Cyril or something but I don\\u2019t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I\\u2019m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I\\u2019m at her home and it\\u2019s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We\\u2019re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis is the person I want you to meet.\\u201d He\\u2019s got this leather jacket and his hair is longish and curly or wavy and dark. Yes, he\\u2019s definitely good looking, but all my alarm bells are going off because he\\u2019s riding a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket - how cliche. And he\\u2019s got tattoos. She says, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s a plant medicine maker, so he knows how to make medicine from plants.\\u201d That peaks my interest because you don\\u2019t meet a lot of men who know how to do that. But I\\u2019m still feeling like I\\u2019m being put on the spot and I don't appreciate matchmaking. It feels awkward because I know he\\u2019s been invited there to meet with me. I don\\u2019t like those kind of situations. I would much rather there be an organic conversation where you\\u2019ve met or something. In this part of the dream I am feeling so awkward with meeting this guy. But I\\u2019m still feeling tender feelings for my friend - I still love her very much and I don't care that she\\u2019s set me up with this dude. I think it\\u2019s kind of funny. Anyway, I\\u2019m not into it. In the next part of the dream, I\\u2019m taking him and a couple friends on a tour. The dream switches scenes again. Now I\\u2019ve left my friend who has done the introductions, but this guy is with me. He\\u2019s off the motorcycle at this point and there are other guys with him. They\\u2019re his friends, I think, but they\\u2019re all strangers to me. I\\u2019m giving them a tour of what I think is my old high school, but it\\u2019s in the snow and my old high school was in Hawaii. So this version of my high school is somewhere in the snow - there\\u2019s lots of ice. We get in a car and I\\u2019m driving them up and around the drive that usually takes us to the school. We drive past the chapel part I grew up going to, past the admissions building. I\\u2019m taking them onto campus because these guys are all going to run a race. So it\\u2019s a bunch of hotshot runners or super athletic guys. Again I\\u2019m asking myself, \\u201cWhy am I with all these guys? Why am I showing them around?\\u201d So we actually end up driving past the beginning of the race and we have to go park way down below in a parking lot. To get to the beginning of the race is a ton of stairs covered in snow and ice. Now because it took a while to drive around, school has let out, so there\\u2019s a bunch of students out and it\\u2019s really really crowded. So these men I\\u2019m leading around are getting a little bit frustrated because it\\u2019s taking extra long to get to the race. They\\u2019re worried they\\u2019re going to miss it - it\\u2019s a running, cross country race. It\\u2019s cold and they\\u2019re in their running shorts - not my problem. I lead them up to the beginning of the race through all these stairs. We\\u2019re winding our ways through the crowds, being careful not to slip on the ice. The headmaster of the school comes to greet us. What\\u2019s interesting is that the school now has a ton of people of color going to it, including black people, but these guys I\\u2019m bringing with me are all white. This is interesting because I\\u2019m noticing as we\\u2019re walking through the crowd, the guys I\\u2019m leading are being rude. They\\u2019re totally trying to use their white male dominance to move themselves through this crowd. They\\u2019re pissing a lot of people off. So the headmaster meets me, and the headmaster in this dream is actually the head of the Waldorf School my kids currently go to now. Her name is Cecilia and she\\u2019s a woman of color. She meets me and helps me lead these men to the start of the race. But she is giving them a lecture on white male privilege, dominance, the patriarchy and their atrocious behavior. There\\u2019s a part of me rubbing my hands in glee, getting to listen to Cecilia school these men who have been incredibly arrogant. We get to the start of the race, which is interesting, because it\\u2019s actually through a bunch of buildings and they have to race through a bunch of doorways before they can get outside. It\\u2019s literally doorways and Cecilia has had me go open up some of the doors so they know which doors to go through. I mark them somehow, so there\\u2019s literally a little note that says, \\u201cRun through this door,\\u201d so they can find their way to the outside, because there is an outside part of this race, but it literally starts in a building and they have to run through these doorways. Now Cecilia has been joined by a male teacher of color who is continuing the lesson and lecture for these white men who are all still in their running gear - short shorts, tennis shoes, a sweater because it\\u2019s cold. They are finishing up this lecture and the white men are part of this other group. The other group has people of color in it. They\\u2019re not in the front to start this race. I really don't know how it\\u2019s going to go because everyone has to run through these doors and these doors are not lined up one after the other. You run through a door, then you have to hang a right to go through another door. It\\u2019s quite maze-like until you get out. But they\\u2019re all set up, ready to go, and the lecturing is done. Sure enough, somebody shoots off one of those little start guns and they start running through. The dream ends there.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a large house with two stories. I think it's my ex-husband\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m not sure. He\\u2019s there or his presence is felt at least, but I don\\u2019t actually see him. There is an upstairs bedroom with a crib in it. There are two babies in it. One of the babies is mine or I gave birth to it. I can\\u2019t tell. It\\u2019s about a year and half and I have this knowing that I left it when it was younger and I\\u2019m coming back now. I\\u2019m not sure why I\\u2019m coming back. I just know that when I see this baby in the cradle that it needs nourishment - it needs feeding. So I bring it to my breast to nurse it. I\\u2019m worried that ti didn\\u2019t get all the nutrients it needed when it was younger. So while I\\u2019m nursing it, I can feel that it\\u2019s a relief for me somehow - like when you get engorged it is taking the pressure off my chest, out of my breast and the baby is getting what it needs. But the whole time I have this sense of sorrow or sadness like I had perhaps abandoned the baby or there was some reason why I wasn\\u2019t able to be with the baby when it was younger and I\\u2019m only coming back now to tend it now that it\\u2019s a year and a half. As I nurse the baby I can feel the relief in my chest and my breasts. It\\u2019s sucking hard like it\\u2019s desperate to get what I have for itself. This is the only part of the dream I remember; there are other pieces, but those are gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a quest and there are a lot of different characters on this quest. I am being escorted by my dad. He\\u2019s the male figure who is with me. There\\u2019s also another part of the party - a child, a younger person, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is. We\\u2019re headed out into what looks like a rather desolate lava field. But before we go, I am with a gypsy woman. I have met with this gypsy woman and we are in her caravan. It\\u2019s a cross between an old fashioned caravan drawn by a pair of horses but also an RV. It\\u2019s awesome. On the inside, it\\u2019s set up the way an RV is set up - you can see through the front windows where the driver\\u2019s seat is, but it\\u2019s still very witchy on the inside. This gypsy woman travels around but doesn\\u2019t necessarily look like a regular gypsy with scarves and whatnot. She is dressed in long robes and has longer hair. She has jewelry and there\\u2019s something about the jewelry - it\\u2019s earrings. I\\u2019m on a quest, but there\\u2019s two, so the first one I go on, I have a particular pair of earrings I pick out from her and I wear them. They\\u2019re a talisman of some sort. They are either protective or hold magic powers that enhance my own. I\\u2019m not entirely sure. I wear these out on this quest and I go out. I don\\u2019t remember the details of it, but I come back into the van. It\\u2019s time for me to continue on the quest, but it\\u2019s a level up now. I\\u2019ve realized this time around that the earrings are really important and I need a good pair for what I\\u2019m going to do. I\\u2019m going through what she has and there\\u2019s this pair that is just stunning. One earring is pearls with long chains and other gems on the bottom. The other earring that\\u2019s part of this pair is a huge chandelier earring which reaches past my breast. It\\u2019s really long. I put them both on and I can feel myself all of a sudden level up, like you would in a video game. She is trying to tell me what the different properties of these earrings are based on the different stones and what\\u2019s in them and what they will allow me to do. So my dad or whoever it - the male figure - is in the background, he\\u2019s still with me. He just is kind of there - he was just kind of there on the first quest and he\\u2019s just kind of there on the second quest. He does make a few suggestions about how to go about doing things, but he\\u2019s definitely taking a backseat. This is all up to me. The gypsy woman and I are conversing about the powers of the earrings, but also my own magical powers that will help me out during this section part of the quest. Then the scene changes from this questing to me being in what seems like a village. It kind of reminds me of the villages you visit in Disneyland. They\\u2019re a little bit fake but they\\u2019re kind of neat because there\\u2019s cool stuff in them. This village is smallish and there is an appearance of all my high school classmates and other people I don't know who are just filling in the spaces. I\\u2019m watching as one of my high school friends - someone who\\u2019s in an older class is building a structure out of logs. It\\u2019s an art piece in the center of the town. The rest of us are coming to gather around. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going and I see him build this. I leave and I go do something else. The structure is up and I see people come and have little meetings around this structure. I\\u2019m in a pool and it\\u2019s an indoor pool entirely enclosed in glass. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m there watching people come and go. There\\u2019s meetings happening. My mom has shown up and I hear her having a meeting with some of my classmates. This is very interesting because one of my classmates is having a tantrum and he\\u2019s screaming and crying just like a little kid would. I can't even see him, but I know who it is by his voice. But I don\\u2019t know what my mom is saying and I don\\u2019t know what the meeting is about. In some way she is this boss or it feels like she\\u2019s some sort of crime lord and my classmates are coming and going and doing her bidding, essentially. I\\u2019m shocked to hear my classmate screaming and crying because it seems like such childish behavior. But my mom is not phased by it at all. I can\\u2019t actually see any of this. I can only hear it and feel what\\u2019s going on. I do not have vision of what this is - they are not in my eyesight. I\\u2019m still in this pool/atrium place and their meeting is somewhere above me - like there\\u2019s rooms upstairs above me. I\\u2019ve stepped out of the atrium and it\\u2019s towards my back. Another classmate has her coffee in hand. It looks like she\\u2019s just woken up and she's in her pajamas. She stomps towards that art piece that the other classmate had made and she just pulls the logs down, yelling. I don\\u2019t even know what she\\u2019s yelling about, but she\\u2019s making the assumption that one of our classmates had made the artpiece. When we tell her that it was actually an upperclassman, she gets a little bit freaked out, but it\\u2019s too late. She can\\u2019t fix the sculpture. It\\u2019s already been pulled down. Throughout this whole time, I am part of this scene - I am part of the village, I am part of what's going on, but I\\u2019m also not. I\\u2019m also the observer and again the outcast, not really included, but also supposed to observe what's going on. Then my alarm went off, so I don\\u2019t remember the rest of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It\\u2019s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we\\u2019re on our way to the place. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s a road that\\u2019s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We\\u2019re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there\\u2019s a ravine under us. We\\u2019re headed to a cave where we\\u2019re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it\\u2019s like - it\\u2019s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I\\u2019m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there\\u2019s water that\\u2019s swirling around the rocks. It\\u2019s so fun because we\\u2019re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I\\u2019m floating and we\\u2019re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We\\u2019re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it\\u2019s smooth and flat. It\\u2019s still light in a sense, it\\u2019s not full daylight. We can still see. It\\u2019s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we\\u2019re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It\\u2019s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I\\u2019ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it\\u2019s very particular, it\\u2019s something I asked for. Then it\\u2019s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I\\u2019m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that\\u2019s everywhere and the flowers - they\\u2019re gathering them. It\\u2019s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There\\u2019s now a table. There\\u2019s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she\\u2019s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they\\u2019re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we\\u2019re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we\\u2019re carrying bags of trash because we\\u2019ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we\\u2019re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn\\u2019t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. It\\u2019s evening time. I am walking around a college campus. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who\\u2019s with me, but it\\u2019s another woman. I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She\\u2019s beautiful. She\\u2019s a little bit sad - she\\u2019s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she\\u2019s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it\\u2019s like an artist studio. It\\u2019s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She\\u2019s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there\\u2019s not much room. We\\u2019re hanging out with her and I\\u2019m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn\\u2019t even have a bathroom and I don\\u2019t think it has a kitchen area - it\\u2019s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She\\u2019s still really, really sad. I\\u2019m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she\\u2019s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend\\u2019s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There\\u2019s a little tension between them, like a depression. They\\u2019re together but they\\u2019re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don\\u2019t know why. They\\u2019re talking and there\\u2019s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it\\u2019s going to be fine - let\\u2019s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it\\u2019s full dark now. There\\u2019s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He\\u2019s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he\\u2019s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He\\u2019s kind of got a belly. He just doesn\\u2019t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there\\u2019s other college kids lingering around. There\\u2019s stuff happening and I\\u2019m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I\\u2019m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It\\u2019s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don\\u2019t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they\\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\\u2019s very orderly. It\\u2019s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they\\u2019re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it\\u2019s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I\\u2019m watching these people come and go and there\\u2019s this competitive energy in me where I\\u2019m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It\\u2019s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There\\u2019s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who\\u2019s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That\\u2019s the atmosphere that we\\u2019re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We\\u2019re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There\\u2019s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there\\u2019s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it\\u2019s mine. But he\\u2019s holding the baby and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I sort of like holding the baby.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don\\u2019t say anything but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, we should do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we\\u2019ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we\\u2019re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He\\u2019s in a costume of some sort and he\\u2019s asking me if I recognize who he is. I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s familiar but I can\\u2019t quite place it.\\u201d Somebody says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your gloves.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cOh yeah my gloves!\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, your Hans Solo!\\u201d He runs off to get his gloves and I\\u2019m still somehow totally content because we\\u2019re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he\\u2019s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There\\u2019s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he\\u2019s at least 10 years younger - which is why I\\u2019m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it\\u2019s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he\\u2019s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I\\u2019m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It\\u2019s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I\\u2019m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, but we\\u2019re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I\\u2019m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it\\u2019s a spaceship. It\\u2019s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they\\u2019re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I\\u2019m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they\\u2019re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I\\u2019m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I\\u2019m starting to be crushed. So I\\u2019m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It\\u2019s me and my friend, Aila. We\\u2019re in a car together, traveling. It\\u2019s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There\\u2019s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it\\u2019s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He\\u2019s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He\\u2019s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don\\u2019t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he\\u2019s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it\\u2019s the sample. It\\u2019s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that\\u2019s made out of gold and it\\u2019s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who\\u2019s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there\\u2019s something up with these bracelets because the material they\\u2019re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, we all need one of these.\\u201d He\\u2019s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it\\u2019s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that\\u2019s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he\\u2019s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there\\u2019s more, but that's all I can remember right now.\"],[\"Holy crap. This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I\\u2019m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he\\u2019s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he\\u2019s talking with me and he\\u2019s trying to court me. He\\u2019s showing me all the things he\\u2019s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he\\u2019s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he\\u2019s done, he\\u2019s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it\\u2019s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He\\u2019s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It\\u2019s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I\\u2019m in my home now - it\\u2019s not very descriptive, I just know I\\u2019m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn\\u2019t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That\\u2019s my first \\u201coh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn\\u2019t look very safe. She\\u2019s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it\\u2019s falling out. There\\u2019s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it\\u2019s also filthy. She\\u2019s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I\\u2019m offering to make them a meal - I guess they\\u2019re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she\\u2019s wild. She doesn\\u2019t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He\\u2019s just telling her what to do. He\\u2019s literally telling her: \\u201cOkay, now do this, do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s so proud of himself. He thinks he\\u2019s being the best dad. I\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god, your daughter is wrecked.\\u201d I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I\\u2019m with the next man in the lineup. It\\u2019s my ex-husband. He\\u2019s different. He\\u2019s also trying to show me how different he is. He\\u2019s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We\\u2019re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There\\u2019s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we\\u2019re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I\\u2019m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I\\u2019m really excited for their blind date. I\\u2019m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we\\u2019re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they\\u2019re snuggling up. I\\u2019m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it\\u2019s cute, it\\u2019s sweet. There\\u2019s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it\\u2019s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there\\u2019s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: \\u201cCan she do it? Is she strong enough?\\u201d Since he\\u2019s already over my back, he\\u2019s essentially in the fireman\\u2019s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\\u2019t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.\\u201d I realize that that\\u2019s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I\\u2019m with the next man. It\\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you\\u2019re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He\\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We\\u2019re hanging out and i\\u2019s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there\\u2019s also different types of equipment around, too. There\\u2019s these three younger men and they\\u2019re teachers or they\\u2019re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: \\u201cOh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.\\u201d So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We\\u2019ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He\\u2019s so attentive and affectionate. He\\u2019s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he\\u2019s getting agitated and I think that\\u2019s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn\\u2019t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken\\u2019s hat and I\\u2019d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He\\u2019s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5\\u20196\\u201d, I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d and Luke\\u2019s about 6\\u20192\\u201d or 3\\u201d or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It\\u2019s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I\\u2019ve seen you strip.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? I\\u2019ve been stripping?!\\u201d Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, \\u201cOh yeah, I totally did that, but don\\u2019t know what it was for.\\u201d Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you\\u2019re amazing and I didn\\u2019t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, \\u201cWhat, do you think you want my hat back now?\\u201d He\\u2019s saying this like he\\u2019s not going to give it to me and I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m like whatever. I hadn\\u2019t thought of it and it\\u2019s not a big deal to me. We\\u2019re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We\\u2019re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he\\u2019s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it\\u2019s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it\\u2019s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I\\u2019m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he\\u2019s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to be a part of any of them. They all seem so unstable!\\u201d\"],[\"There are three distinct parts to this dream. The first part I remember is a gathering of a lot of women - at least 25 of us. It\\u2019s a retreat and it\\u2019s towards the end of the retreat. It\\u2019s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She\\u2019s been doing a lot of the teaching. I\\u2019ve been in the mix, too. I\\u2019m not a participant, but I\\u2019m there. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m helping out with the retreat or not. She\\u2019s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They\\u2019re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She\\u2019s giving them a speech, more or less, that\\u2019s along the lines of: \\u201cOkay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.\\u201d I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn\\u2019t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else\\u2019s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I\\u2019m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they\\u2019re all complaining. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cDid you not learn anything from what we just did?\\u201d They\\u2019re all holding hands with each other. They\\u2019re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I\\u2019m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that\\u2019s what I should be doing because I\\u2019m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don\\u2019t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave their clothes where they are and I walk away from the clothesline and I walk away from the whole retreat. I am thinking that I need to leave them all to their own devices because they don\\u2019t get it. That\\u2019s the thought going through my head. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m in conversation with my ex-husband about our daughter. It\\u2019s my time with them - we\\u2019re still sharing custody and visiting time. My son is there and he\\u2019s closeby - he\\u2019s with me. But my daughter is not there and I\\u2019m asking my ex where she is. He tells me, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s at her friend Gus or Gum\\u2019s house.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWho is that? I don\\u2019t know who that is.\\u201d He tells me that he is a teammate of hers. She\\u2019s apparently playing soccer and this is her teammate. But she\\u2019s 12 and this boy is a little bit older - that\\u2019s the impression I get. I\\u2019m starting to get pissed off and scared because I don\\u2019t know this kid\\u2019s parents and they live in another county. There\\u2019s a little map flashing before my eyes and the place they live is highlighted and flashing and it\\u2019s far away from where we are - at least a day away by car. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I don\\u2019t know this kid, I don\\u2019t know his parents, I haven\\u2019t talked with my daughter in a long time and I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing and I don\\u2019t trust that she\\u2019s safe. I start yelling at my ex, telling her he can\\u2019t just let her go to places that he doesn\\u2019t know the parents or the situation just because she wants to hang out with a boy, essentially. He doesn\\u2019t get it. His face turns stone cold. I\\u2019m trying to keep my voice even and level. But the more he grey rocks what I say, the louder and frustrated I get until I\\u2019m just yelling at him. I\\u2019m so disgusted with him. His dad is the one driving my daughter down and back and he\\u2019s there. I\\u2019m just as mad and frustrated at him. It feels very much like they\\u2019re stonewalling me and taking my daughter. But they're putting her at risk is what I feel. I'm panicked and so upset but getting no answers from them. I\\u2019m asking them where this boy lives because I want to go pick her up, but they won\\u2019t tell me. So the dreams shifts again and I retain the panic. In the next shift of the dream, I\\u2019m hanging with some friends - some are from high school, some are from this time - other instructors I\\u2019ve met at the pole studio. We\\u2019re all outside. It\\u2019s a bright, beautiful sunny day. We\\u2019re walking down a paved path - it\\u2019s available for a lot of people to walk on. It\\u2019s me and another girl and another guy. Other couples are around me as well. We\\u2019re all walking and there\\u2019s space between the other couples and me and this girl and this guy. I\\u2019m noticing that they\\u2019re starting to hit it off. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m jealous or frustrated. I\\u2019m having an emotional reaction, but not sure. Some of it is that panic has carried over from the last part of the dream. Again I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou guys don\\u2019t really know each other. It\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up right now.\\u201d We all stop walking. We end up at some sort of grassy area. The couples have split off - they have their own blankets. This guy and this girl - there\\u2019s a sense that I know who they are, but I\\u2019m not seeing who they actually are - they split off, too. Everyone gets under a blanket. I\\u2019m watching and can tell that these two are hooking up. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know each other!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at this through the lens of us being in quarantine and I\\u2019m thinking it\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up with someone you\\u2019ve just met while we\\u2019re in this quarantine. I\\u2019m just really concerned again. Then somebody passes out bathing suits to all of the women. I\\u2019m watching as all of the women and all these couples put these bathing suits on. They look different on every single woman. It\\u2019s very interesting to see how it\\u2019s the same cut of bathing suit bikini, but looks so different on every single woman. I have one, too, and am trying to put it on. But I\\u2019m putting it on over my clothes and I don\\u2019t understand why I\\u2019m doing that, other than the thought going through my head is that I want the added layer of protection. Everybody else seems a little bit carefree and somewhat nonchalant about the situation we find ourselves in. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve hooked up with their person and it\\u2019s them and their person and they\\u2019re okay. But I\\u2019m by myself. I\\u2019m watching all these couples and the ones that have been together I\\u2019m like, \\u201cyeah okay, they\\u2019re good,\\u201d but the ones that haven't been together, I\\u2019m totally horrified and that sense of not just panic, but a little bit that I\\u2019m in the wrong frequency goes through all the dreams - that I\\u2019m just not in the right timeline. That sense, I woke up with and still feel.\"],[\"I\\u2019m working with a friend and we\\u2019re having a meeting. She also has clients and we\\u2019re in her house. She\\u2019s showing them how she does some of her artwork - some of her painting. I\\u2019ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that\\u2019s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she\\u2019s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I\\u2019m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She\\u2019s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I\\u2019m wearing. I say, \\u201cThis is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.\\u201d It feels good between us - she\\u2019s my friend and my boss. We\\u2019re having a good time and I\\u2019m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We\\u2019re in the same house area, but now it\\u2019s my house. We\\u2019ve completed our work and she leaves. I\\u2019m realizing there\\u2019s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, \\u201cHey, there\\u2019s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I\\u2019m not going to get it to you this month.\\u201d I\\u2019m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It\\u2019s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I\\u2019m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven\\u2019t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t received your rent check this month. And I\\u2019ve heard that there\\u2019s a drone outside your house and I\\u2019m a little bit confused.\\u201d He\\u2019s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can\\u2019t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he\\u2019s saying is that there\\u2019s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It\\u2019s at the windows and it films me. I feel super violated - like my privacy has been violated. He\\u2019s really shaming about it even though I didn\\u2019t know there was a drone there. But his connection finally dies and I don\\u2019t hear him anymore. I go to call him back and try to get a hold of him so I can tell him I\\u2019m not paying rent. I hear him say something about there\\u2019s going to be an inspection. Then the connection is totally dead. I feel concerned because now I\\u2019m worried about this drone. I head back to the house. The house looks like a Victorain era dollhouse - it\\u2019s got one of those roundish rooms that reminds me of a tower and a lot of frill on the trim. I\\u2019m walking towards the house, but first I\\u2019m in the parking lot. There\\u2019s a parking lot and what looks like low income housing - they\\u2019re all one-story, the roof is flat, they\\u2019ve got a carport, and they\\u2019re all connected like apartments or a motel, actually. I see a friend of mine and she\\u2019s got a couple of kids. Then there\\u2019s a sheriff and he\\u2019s inspecting the place, but giving her an extra hard time. She has the front door open and her kids are running around. He\\u2019s telling her: \\u201cYour house looks dirty from outside.\\u201d He\\u2019s making her show him her car which also is dirty. He\\u2019s totally just giving her a hard time. I\\u2019m watching to make sure that he\\u2019s not just harassing her. It feels like he\\u2019s doing his job, but going out of his way to be a total asshole. Then he sees me and he heads towards my place, and he\\u2019s like: \\u201cYour house stinks. It smells, especially right here on the back porch area.\\u201d There\\u2019s actually another guy waiting for me on my porch. I recognize him as my lover - I think - but he doesn\\u2019t look like my type at all. He\\u2019s got blond hair and blue eyes. He\\u2019s kind of tall and it looks like he\\u2019s just come from a football game because he\\u2019s got his football gear and he\\u2019s really sweaty, stinky and smelly. But I guess this is my person because I\\u2019m really happy to see him. He\\u2019s standing on this porch where the law enforcement person is telling me it smells really bad. I look and I see there\\u2019s a window seat that juts out from the house over the porch a little bit. Underneath the window seat is one brown wool sock and one bottle of forgotten soda or something. But the foundation of this porch is all stone and is rotted - there\\u2019s moss and it\\u2019s black and the stone is crumbling. My lover is standing up there and he comes down and he greets me. He shushes the sheriff and we start to go into the house. But my brother shows up. He starts to dig out the stone that\\u2019s rotted. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it!\\u201d I know that the smell coming from it and whatever is under it is supposed to stay under, like it\\u2019s an old ancient curse or something - kind of like they bury vampires. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d But my brother starts digging it up. Sure enough, there\\u2019s a body wrapped in chains. It\\u2019s folded in on itself. As soon as my brother gets the rock off, it unfolds itself and it\\u2019s a king. I\\u2019m horrified: \\u201cNow you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve just let the bad guy out.\\u201d Then I hear some other rock crumbling. I\\u2019m up in the tower place now because it has all the windows. I turn and from my vantage point, I see that the queen has been let out, too. She\\u2019s also been in chains. They both have gunk on them because they're so old. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck, this is not good.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to grab me and my lover - now we have to leave the house. Now we have to get down these stairs and past these things and out past the house. There\\u2019s a level of horror and also comedy because the queen is hideously ugly and she\\u2019s just bitching. She\\u2019s clearly very bad tempered and it\\u2019s a little bit cliche in that way. We\\u2019re coming down the stairs trying to avoid them and we do make it outside. I don\\u2019t know what happens to my lover - he disappears. I run into this 11 or 12 year old boy. He\\u2019s kind of playful and naughty - very much trickster energy. I can hear a voice that\\u2019s sort of narrating what\\u2019s happening with this queen and king coming out and this boy who is kind of teasing. He\\u2019s running off away from me and the queen and king are trying to follow him. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re the bad guys trying to catch this boy, but this voice that I\\u2019m hearing suddenly shows up. It\\u2019s a man with a troubadour hat with a feather and he\\u2019s dressed in stockings - like Shakespeare, old style. He\\u2019s got one of those frilly collars around his neck. It turns out he\\u2019s the one that either the king and queen are chasing, or he\\u2019s chasing the boy. I\\u2019m not sure. It\\u2019s a little convoluted. I just know it's time to get the hell out of there because whatever is happening is not my business. The house is a lost cause. I have no idea where my lover went. My brother is off - I don\\u2019t know where he went; he let these things out and now he\\u2019s gone. I\\u2019ve been heading towards a crowd, following this boy and watching things unfold and I just let myself get lost in the crowd. \"],[\"I am with a friend but I\\u2019m not actually sure who it is - there\\u2019s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we\\u2019ve known each other for a while. We\\u2019re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don\\u2019t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We\\u2019re walking through a town. We\\u2019re on the streets of the downtown area. It\\u2019s dark - like night time or really early morning. We\\u2019re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that\\u2019s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she\\u2019s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it\\u2019s a room off to the side. I\\u2019m so happy to see her. She\\u2019s such a beautiful soul. And she\\u2019s so happy to see me. She\\u2019s showing me some of the pieces she\\u2019s working on. It\\u2019s an interesting interaction because there\\u2019s this air of how much we love each other and she\\u2019s so excited about all her work and I\\u2019m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They\\u2019re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there\\u2019s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it\\u2019s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she\\u2019s found a different coffee shop. So we\\u2019re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It\\u2019s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I\\u2019m happy to see her, but also not. There\\u2019s a little bit of, \\u201cOh no, I don\\u2019t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me\\u201d (which is what happened in real life). So I\\u2019m kind of glad to see her, but there\\u2019s also part of her that\\u2019s also sort of ignoring me. She\\u2019s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I\\u2019m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I\\u2019m with - the one who I still don\\u2019t know who it is - says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.\\u201d So, we\\u2019re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There\\u2019s a bunch of people at it. They\\u2019ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\\u2019m on vacation. I\\u2019m not doing any business. There\\u2019s no meetings.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWell you know this is a BNI meeting.\\u201d The way these things work is if you\\u2019re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn\\u2019t know that was happening, but it feels like that\\u2019s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that\\u2019s gotten us in the mess we\\u2019re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh D\\u2019s here! Great!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my fucking god, get me out of here now.\\u201d He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn\\u2019t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, \\u201cEh.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw.\\u201d He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cFuck, you can\\u2019t even be neutral. You can\\u2019t even control your body. You\\u2019re in my damn space and I don\\u2019t even want to be here!\\u201d I still haven\\u2019t had any food or coffee, so probably I\\u2019m \\u201changry\\u201d - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don\\u2019t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I\\u2019m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it\\u2019s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it\\u2019s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I\\u2019m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There\\u2019s a pier off to my right. There\\u2019s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He\\u2019s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He\\u2019s also writing stuff out in the sand that they\\u2019re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren\\u2019t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I\\u2019m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There\\u2019s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I\\u2019m noticing them as I\\u2019m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I\\u2019m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party, it\\u2019s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I\\u2019m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m feeling like, \\u201cUh, I don\\u2019t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn\\u2019t feel super good.\\u201d Fear of judgment and all that. I\\u2019m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we\\u2019re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll be back.\\u201d I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019ve never seen before, but it's a house that\\u2019s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I\\u2019m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I\\u2019m at her house, which I don\\u2019t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They\\u2019re talking to me about planning how they\\u2019re going to remodel parts of their house and how it\\u2019s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they\\u2019re going to earn it. I\\u2019m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he\\u2019s one of those ages). They\\u2019re showing me how they\\u2019re going to do it. They\\u2019re really, really friendly - it\\u2019s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there\\u2019s different ways. I\\u2019m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, \\u201cWell, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.\\u201d So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It\\u2019s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.\\u201d Then my friend is like, \\u201cWell I need you to come and do this thing with me.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I\\u2019m feeling torn because I don\\u2019t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there\\u2019s all these crappy t-shirts like you\\u2019d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They\\u2019re on one of those round racks and I\\u2019m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re doing all these things, come do this with me.\\u201d A second friend from the party comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGuess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.\\u201d She\\u2019s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that\\u2019s where I worked. It\\u2019s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on this field trip with a bunch of children - an entire school\\u2019s worth. They\\u2019re all 5th grade and younger, but not below 2nd grade - there aren\\u2019t really young children there. We\\u2019re at this state park. It\\u2019s gorgeous. There\\u2019s an open field that\\u2019s two football fields long and at least one football field wide. It\\u2019s on one side of the road that\\u2019s the entrance to the park. Trees line the road and the field. On the other side of the field there\\u2019s all forest and it\\u2019s pretty thick and dense forest - it\\u2019s dark and you can\\u2019t see really far into it. Then on the other side of the road it looks like a school with buildings that look like classrooms but also could be places or cabins where you can pay a fee and stay. I see a playground and a cafeteria or place you can eat where they sell the shitty food you\\u2019d find in parks - ice cream cones and corn dogs. There\\u2019s another building on the left hand side of the road with the big open field or meadow. The building is on the end of the field. The road goes down and stops at this huge wide river. On this side there are rocks or sands that go down into the river like a beach. On the other side are tall, tall cliffs that drop off into the river and it is deep on this side but shallow on my side. The river flows from left to right. This is a familiar river to me. So there\\u2019s tons of kids hanging around. I\\u2019m there. At first I thought I was a chaperone, but I\\u2019m not. There\\u2019s tons of other parents who are chaperoning all the kids. I\\u2019m providing supplies. I have bags and bags full of clothes for the kids to wear - the same dress for all the girls to wear or the same pair of jeans for everybody to wear. It\\u2019s really bizarre. I have a hundred pairs of them in all different sizes, so everybody has a pair. I\\u2019m also in charge of setting up and spreading out the food, but also telling people where to sleep. So I\\u2019m basically providing all of the basics for people and organizing it. It feels very much like I\\u2019m providing the most efficient way for everybody to get what they need. But I'm also participating in this sleepover campout as one of hte kids, too. So I\\u2019m not taking a parent role, even though my kids are there because while I\\u2019m providing all these things, I\\u2019m actually in my later twenties. There are some other teenagers or early twenties kids. So there\\u2019s a little bit of an age gap, but not so much. I\\u2019m definitely not in a parental role, per se. With the younger ones, I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re not going in the river and getting drowned. But me and the other twenty year olds are flirting, which is the craziest thing. I\\u2019m making sure everyone is sleeping and finding sleeping areas. I head down to the river and there is a path kind of like a boardwalk - it\\u2019s got wooden slats. I take this path and it\\u2019s taking me towards this other building. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what\\u2019s there. There are some laundry machines. One young man is following me. He\\u2019s blond and his hair is curly, shoulder-length. He\\u2019s very good looking in a very angelic way - the way they paint those angel portraits from the Renaissance era. He\\u2019s got his arms around me. I\\u2019m the older one, definitely showing him how everything works, but he\\u2019s very like: \\u201cI want to be with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m finding it strange because there is at least an 8 year age difference between us. I take him with me to where there is all this laundry piled up from clothes that all of these 100+ kids wore yesterday. I\\u2019m looking at it and realizing I\\u2019d rather be spending time with this person and I don\\u2019t want to be doing all the laundry for everybody and making sure they know where their assigned sleeping places are and making sure that they all eat. So I have just left food out for them to come get as they want. I have left the laundry, like \\u201cYo parents, wash your own laundry if you want.\\u201d I leave them to their own devices to sleep wherever they want - parents you\\u2019re in charge and here are all the sleeping bags. They do, but they all end up being cold and hungry because no one is actually taking care of them now. But I still feel like I\\u2019m not the chaperone or person in charge - I don\\u2019t even know how I ended up with all of the stuff for everyone. I am way more interested in cultivating a relationship with this person, except that it\\u2019s very short-lived. We leave the building that has all of the laundry and other stuff in it. We go back to the group in this big field surrounded by trees. Everybody is milling around. There are a lot of cars parked in part of the field. I\\u2019m watching some parents drive off with their kids but not watching out for other kids. It\\u2019s giving me a heart attack because I\\u2019m afraid someone\\u2019s going to get run over. I leave this guy. He had his arm around me, we were walking side by side and at one point we were holding hands and kissing. But I left him to make sure some of the kids didn\\u2019t get run over. I turn around and he\\u2019s got a blanket over him - one of the blankets I provided. But now he\\u2019s with this younger girl who is younger than him, so I guess she\\u2019s teenage-aged if he\\u2019s in his early twenties. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, what the fuck?!\\u201d at how quick his attentions turned. So now I go back down towards the river one more time. I\\u2019m watching everybody. They\\u2019re awake and playing. Some kids are wearing the clothes I provided, but some kids are wearing other clothes because now they\\u2019ve got it figured out. Some are learning how to swim and there\\u2019s an instructor teaching them how to swim in the river. As I\\u2019m walking down the boardwalk again and there\\u2019s sand off to one side, I see that this dad has soccer balls in a huge jar. He\\u2019s showing the kids that there are three different kinds of soccer balls and they each have different amounts of energy and power. So he\\u2019s keeping them in the jar. One of them is a regular soccer ball - if you drop it, it bounces a little bit but doesn\\u2019t go very far. The next one he shows us, he says, \\u201cYeah, look how much power\\u2019s in this.\\u201d He drops it in the jar and the jar comes back up at least five feet off the ground and you see this soccer ball make an explosion within the jar because it has so much energy and power in it. Then he says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even the strongest one.\\u201d He grabs this third soccer ball and he drops it. When it lands, it\\u2019s in a jar again - somehow these jars are not breaking - and it bounces above my head. Every time the balls bounce, they flashlight. So it\\u2019s three different levels of power within each of these soccer balls. The last two have so much power that they have to be contained within jars. I\\u2019m kind of fascinated by it. He\\u2019s giving these kids a lesson. I\\u2019m paying attention, but then continue to walk by. Then I hear another kid (these kids are more like 12, 13, 14) shouting and he\\u2019s looking in the water. There\\u2019s a gigantic jellyfish that\\u2019s yellow with red long jellyfish arms - I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re called. It\\u2019s floating in the river and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHoly shit! There\\u2019s jellyfish in this river? We should not be teaching the kids how to swim in here.\\u201d It comes up to the shore and then the fucking thing is panicking me becuase it starts to crawl on the land! There\\u2019s the boy who saw it and a couple other girls, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cY\\u2019all need to get away from this thing because it is crawling up the land and it\\u2019s going to sting you.\\u201d I stand on a chair, thinking it won\\u2019t be able to crawl up the chair. It doesn\\u2019t crawl up the chair, but it latches itself onto the bottom of the seat. It\\u2019s an outdoor chair that\\u2019s metal, so the seat is wire - like the crosshatch - and the back is a wrought-iron metal back. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHoly shit! This thing is dangerous because it can crawl on land and it can crawl up a chair!\\u201d It has latched itself to the bottom of the seat. It\\u2019s giving birth and laying two jellyfish babies. I\\u2019m not even sure they\\u2019re jellyfish because they\\u2019re on land! I\\u2019m totally freaked out and trying to make sure that whatever kids that are nearby are out of the way of this jellyfish. I had been standing on that chair and then I step on another chair, then a few steps back. Then I go and tell all the parents to be careful of this fucking crazy jellyfish and don\\u2019t let the kids in the water because it came out of the water. This thing is horrifying me because it can walk on land and it\\u2019s in the water, so it\\u2019s that much more dangerous. I\\u2019m worried about the kids.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a man - I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is. There\\u2019s a couple of other people with us. It feels very cultish - he\\u2019s some sort of guru and has some say over what I do and don\\u2019t do. It\\u2019s very unlike me. We are wandering through a park. There\\u2019s not a lot of people. It feels like people are in quarantine. There is a group of people that are gathered and they\\u2019re listening to music. There are maybe 10 or 15 of them inside of a tent - one of those white event tents and the musicians are in the front. My group with the guru go towards the tent - there's another section of the tent that\\u2019s been walled off and private and we\\u2019re heading there. When I get up to the group of people, I see a bunch of people I know. One of them is Maria. I see her and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! Hi!\\u201d She looks at me and is like, \\u201cHi.\\u201d What\\u2019s really interesting is her face is really round and chubby. It\\u2019s her but her face is swollen or she\\u2019s gotten really fat but only from the jaw up. It\\u2019s a bit weird. I\\u2019m happy to see her but remembering that things did not end well with us. She\\u2019s looking at me and has a look on her face - I can tell that she\\u2019s trying to apologize. She wants to say something along the lines of, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry things ended the way they did.\\u201d As I\\u2019m talking with her, the guru and some of the other group that I\\u2019m a part of (it feels like an open relationship type of situation, but not really because the guru is in charge and the rest of us are like satellites that are with him) are mad that I\\u2019m talking with Maria. The guru doesn\\u2019t want me to talk with her because I\\u2019m still feeling a connection with her. She\\u2019s obviously feeling remorseful about the way things ended. I can see that she\\u2019s trying to make an apology. I\\u2019m sitting down. Maria and I are sitting on these 3-legged stools talking to each other. One of the other people from the guru group comes up to me and tapes a stone onto my wrist. It\\u2019s clear scotch tape and the stone is very flat, no bigger than 2 inches long and maybe a quarter inch thick and maybe an inch in width. It\\u2019s smooth and polished - like marble or granite. So he tapes it to my wrist and is like, \\u201cThe guru wants to see you. He doesn\\u2019t want you here. He wants to remind you that you are his and you need to go back.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to go back. I want to finish this conversation with Maria. We\\u2019re talking. The tent was separated, so the guru group is in one area and the musicians and everyone are in the other. I feel somebody grabbing my foot and pulling me from the stool I\\u2019m sitting on, under the flap that separates the two parts of the tent and back into his space. Maria is a little concerned and upset because she wants to finish talking with me. But she\\u2019s also very curious and wants to know about the group. So she follows me in and I watch as the guru guy works his magic on her. It\\u2019s a brainwashing that I\\u2019m watching happen in front of me. So I\\u2019m sitting there and back in the circle talking with other friends, expressing that I\\u2019m upset and don\\u2019t want to be there. The guru is teaching and trying to give some kind of wisdom and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is bullshit.\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed. There\\u2019s a woven cocoon thing that looks like a basket-weaving with reeds, the size of a birdfeeder - it looks like those ornaments that are narrow on the top and bottom and get wide in the middle and are long, and it has a hole opening for the birds to come in through. The guru is weaving it while he\\u2019s talking. All of a sudden, Maria is with me and I hear her starting to orgasm. I realize he\\u2019s making a spell as he\\u2019s sewing and completing this birdhouse weaving. She\\u2019s sort of against her will but also totally enjoying it. I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, \\u201cWhat the fuck?! How did this happen? When am I going to get what I need?\\u201d\"],[\"This dream really did not want to stick. I kept trying to call it back and it wouldn\\u2019t come even though I could feel the felt sense of it. There was something good going to happen if I could just get the right thing to happen - if I could just be lucid enough in the dream and follow the thread of what felt good, then something good would happen. I was in a large dance hall and the windows were floor to ceiling with curtains on either side. There\\u2019s bleachers. I\\u2019m sitting on the bleachers and take my shoes off. The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they\\u2019re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don\\u2019t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren\\u2019t there. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you\\u2019d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - \\u201chey go look over there, there\\u2019s all these shoes.\\u201d There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn\\u2019t progress through the dream if I didn\\u2019t find them. And I didn\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching these two men. There's been a gathering of Native Hawaiians and they were all making lei for each other. It\\u2019s beautiful. But now I\\u2019m watching this man I know, Stan - he was an upperclassman for a few years when I was in school and he had a twin brother. He\\u2019s standing in front of a huge loom, the size of a garage door. There\\u2019s this other man who is a stranger to the culture, not raised in Hawaii, but he really wants to know how to weave this loom with flowers. It\\u2019s kind of like he\\u2019s trying to learn the native ways. I\\u2019d say these men are both in their late 20s, early 30s. So this man that\\u2019s trying to learn, he\\u2019s a stranger to me in the dream, he has picked a flower - it\\u2019s a gorgeous purple flower with maybe 5 petals that are long and spiky and the stamin in the center are also long and really skinny and you can see the pollen at the tips. He\\u2019s trying to weave this entire loom with these purple flowers. He\\u2019s doing okay under the instruction of Stan. I\\u2019m feeling frustrated watching him because that\\u2019s not a flower that Native Hawaiians ever wove with or made lei with. So I\\u2019m like this guy doesn\\u2019t get it - he doesn\\u2019t understand the meaning of each flower that the Hawaiians would use. But he\\u2019s gotten most of the door woven. He keeps messing up. I go to try to help him complete it. Parts of what he\\u2019s woven falling off the frame. I\\u2019m trying to help him keep it taut. I started out observing, but now I\\u2019m part of the dream. I\\u2019m trying to show him how and the other guy is trying to show him how, too. He doesn\\u2019t get it. There\\u2019s a part of me that\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis guy is a little bit mental, he\\u2019s slow on the uptake, he\\u2019s not understanding how to do this.\\u201d Then Stan suddenly turns into a black cat and is so affectionate with me. This is funny because cats are not always affectionate. But as a cat, he\\u2019s super affectionate with me and I can feel he\\u2019s still waiting for this other guy to complete the weaving. This woman shows up, her name is Audrey (she plays the guitar and she\\u2019s an incredible musician). She is trying to give more pointers to the guy doing the weaving, but also mentioning: \\u201cOh my gosh, I\\u2019ve never seen him do that as a cat. I\\u2019ve never seen him rub up on somebody so much and be in your lap and try to be so affectionate.\\u201d I am a little bit curious about this. It seems like the cat wants to be turned back into Stan, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure what he needs, except for that the weaving needs to be finished. The woman does tell the other guy who has been doing the weaving: \\u201cJust so you know, we don\\u2019t use that flower for that and that\\u2019s why the spell is not going right. Then the weaving is finished and we leave it where it is hanging in this loom over a garage. Audrey is showing me some rings that she has. This whole time the black cat is on me and with me. She has pulled down this tupperware container from a shelf above the garage door. There are all these rings in it that are all gold. She says: \\u201cYou need to take a ring, this is what the cat is trying to tell you.\\u201d She shows me one of the rings she\\u2019s wearing from the container. It\\u2019s pure gold and really thick, and segmented like those watches you can slip on because they\\u2019re elastic. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay I\\u2019ll find one.\\u201d I\\u2019m digging through and looking for a silver one, but there aren\\u2019t any silver ones. I\\u2019m a little bummed because I want a silver one, not a gold one like the one she has on. In this same plastic container, there\\u2019s underwear and sports bras. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cThese are ones that I used to have, but I\\u2019m giving them away, if there\\u2019s anything in here that you would like.\\u201d I\\u2019m going through it and there\\u2019s nothing I like. They\\u2019re the wrong colors or the wrong style. So I leave it. Then the dream shifts. My friend Aila, who is part Native American, shows up in the dream with Audrey. We leave this garage area and walk out to her porch. Her kids are with us. But her son is sick - he\\u2019s not feeling well. We're all supposed to be getting in a car to go somewhere. We walk out the garage and we\\u2019re on a smaller porch. We\\u2019re looking out across a lot of land with cattle in the background, and to the right, a low and long building with corrugated roofing on the side that slants up - like half of a manufactured home. There\\u2019s also a pack of dogs, almost 10 of them. We\\u2019re sitting on the porch and it\\u2019s time for us to leave. Aila tells her kids to go get in the car, but her son is sick and they both go, but I\\u2019m like: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if he should be going with us. He\\u2019s not well. He could get something and get more sick. Or he could get other people sick.\\u201d Aila is sitting in a big wicker chair with a big round back - it\\u2019s her porch furniture. She takes her binoculars. We\\u2019re discussing whether or not her son should go. She says, \\u201cOh my god, every time I\\u2019m in a crisis point, or something like this happens, this dog always shows up. It\\u2019s name is Baxter.\\u201d So she\\u2019s looking through her binoculars and I look to the pack of dogs. The dogs are all different - big and small, all different colors and breeds. Sure enough, there's this dog that wasn\\u2019t there before. It has a bandana around its neck. I think that\\u2019s the one she\\u2019s talking about, but I don\\u2019t know because there are 10 different dogs and I haven\\u2019t seen any of them before. It seems very significant to her that this dog shows up any time something like this happens.\"],[\"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I\\u2019m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She\\u2019s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She\\u2019s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I\\u2019m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we\\u2019re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it\\u2019s men. We\\u2019re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila\\u2019s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We\\u2019re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it\\u2019s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I\\u2019m watching and I see Aila\\u2019s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it\\u2019s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I\\u2019m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it\\u2019s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it\\u2019s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It\\u2019s not quite a break wall because it doesn\\u2019t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I\\u2019m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He\\u2019s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They\\u2019re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It\\u2019s okay that they\\u2019re playing. I don\\u2019t have any concerns about who they\\u2019re playing with. I think that because I\\u2019m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They\\u2019re definitely working something out. I\\u2019m not concerned about that part at all. I\\u2019m just concerned that both children don\\u2019t drown. I\\u2019m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They\\u2019re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they\\u2019re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They\\u2019re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they\\u2019re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I\\u2019m watching this happen and by this time I\\u2019ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I\\u2019m concerned and don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. She says, \\u201cThe train was raided by these police officers.\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get to it. We weren\\u2019t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.\\u201d I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She\\u2019s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she\\u2019s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it\\u2019s the thing that she\\u2019s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a guy I know. In the dream, we\\u2019re together, maybe we\\u2019re dating. I have this feeling I\\u2019m trying to prove myself to him and that feels really gross. We\\u2019re together and he\\u2019s wanting to go from one island to the next. So we\\u2019re on the Big Island and trying to get to Maui. At least that\\u2019s the impression I have. But the setting doesn\\u2019t look like the islands I know. We are driving in a car and there's a baby in a car seat - I think it\\u2019s mine and his, but I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m trying to tell him how in the past, I had island hopped. I would take my car and drive it down this really long stretch of road and catch enough air to hop the channel - a very wide expanse of ocean between the islands. Somehow I\\u2019m trying to convince him I can do this. He\\u2019s very harsh. I\\u2019m trying to live up to expectations. It\\u2019s very strange because that is definitely not how I roll in real life. I\\u2019m driving the car to the place where I know we can catch enough air to ocean hop. We get to the end of the road - to this spot where I know I\\u2019ve done it before. There\\u2019s a huge wall rising up out of the ocean. It\\u2019s painted in colors of blue to look like the ocean. There\\u2019s actually ocean that comes over the top of it - water has been pumped over the top to make waterfalls. I\\u2019m shocked because it was definitely not there before. The times I had tried it, the road went off the edge of a cliff so you could catch some air. Now the road goes down and hits a shore. There's no way to catch enough air to get off of that and over this huge wall that\\u2019s now in front of us. I can feel that he is questioning me and what I\\u2019m telling him. He\\u2019s suspicious. I take the car and I get down to the bottom and see this is not happening. So I turn the car around. We head off to the right to an old dive bar. I say, \\u201cMaybe there\\u2019s somebody over there who can help us who\\u2019s done it before.\\u201d So we park and we go in. It\\u2019s totally dimly lit and smoky. The food is greasy and gross. We sit there and the woman who comes up to take our order reminds me of a friend of mine. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yea, I\\u2019ve figured out how to get over that wall. It takes certain skills and some special tools.\\u201d She\\u2019s also mad about something. She\\u2019s got revenge on the brain. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you how.\\u201d There are other people in this dive bar/diner breakfast place. They all look seedy and suspicious - rough around the edges. As this woman is talking to us, she\\u2019s super bitter and resentful. I can't tell if it\\u2019s because of where she works or the people she works with or what, but she\\u2019s definitely holding a grudge. She has her apron on and she\\u2019s holding her little notepad in her hand. We are trying to order some food and the baby is with us and sitting in its car seat - so strange because I can\\u2019t tell if this baby is mine or ours or what, but we\\u2019re taking care of it. She offers to go with us to get the car over the wall so we can go from one island to the next. It\\u2019s really important for us to go to Maui because I get the sense that it is a place where we will be free. So, she offers to go with us. Her and the ugy I\\u2019m with start hatching a plan and it\\u2019s kind of violent. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019ve gotta blow up this part of the wall.\\u201d So one of us has to swim under the waterfall part and plant these little grenades down low in the sand. I\\u2019m down iwth all of this, but another part of me is like, \\u201cthis is fucking insane. All of it is insane. What is going on?\\u201d We all get into the car. At this point other people have joined in on the plan. They are her people. So she is following us with these other people in a car, or maybe we\\u2019re following them. We\\u2019re heading back to that part where the road stops down near the ocean, but you can see the wall. She gets in the water with a knife and what I assume are grenades or something. A bunch of other guys she's with - her crew - get in the water. I see the guy I\\u2019m with get in the water. I\\u2019ve got the kid in the car. Then I\\u2019m also going in the water. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s watching the kid at this point. We all swim out to this wall. You can tell this wall was built by humans and it\\u2019s a tactic to keep us fenced or hedged in. Now all of us are totally intent on blowing up this wall. There\\u2019s still an edge of violence, anger and rage coming off the guy I was with. But now you can tell it\\u2019s a suicide mission for the woman and she\\u2019s giving up her life for this. Her crew - all the dudes she\\u2019s with - same. This has turned into some sort of \\u201cfor the greater good\\u201d cause. I\\u2019m treading water and don\\u2019t know how this is going to work. At this point I\\u2019m mostly watching because I don\\u2019t have an active role in bringing this down. I\\u2019m not quite sure what my partner is either, but he\\u2019s got an important part to play. All I can see is that the woman has died under the water. Before she dives under she says, \\u201cI hope this serves,\\u201d or something like that. I watch her dive under the water and she puts the grenades down at the bottom. The wall explodes and she explodes - actually, she disintegrates in front of me. Somehow I\\u2019m fine even though I\\u2019m in the water - I\\u2019ve backed up enough that this isn\\u2019t going to affect me. I watch a portion of the wall come down. Then me and the guy I\\u2019m with swim back to the car and we back way up the road in the car. He\\u2019s still like, \\u201cthis better work\\u201d and he\\u2019s going to blame it on me if it doesn\\u2019t. At this point, \\u201cI\\u2019m like, dude, you guys did all that crap. If it doesn\\u2019t work then I don\\u2019t know what to tell you.\\u201d But the urge to be free is really strong for both of us, so we\\u2019re both willing to try anyway, even though he seems completely ready to scapegoat me for whatever doesn\\u2019t happen. I\\u2019m a little pissed off about all that. So we back the car up all the way up and get as much speed as possible and somehow manage to launch over the broken part of the wall and make it to Maui. At this point, the dream completely shifts. Now I\\u2019m on the top of a hill. There\\u2019s a sports store where I\\u2019m working. Down below is another type of store - it looks like a UPS shipping center warehouse or something like that. To the left of that is a gym. I think I\\u2019m working in the sports warehouse store. I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie, but in some of the pictures, I\\u2019m naked from the waist down and in some of the pictures I\\u2019m completely naked and in some of the pictures I have all my clothes on. I have no idea what I\\u2019m doing or what that\\u2019s for, but apparently I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie to post on instagram. As I\\u2019m going back to work after this, I run into a friend - I think it\\u2019s an old classmate. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know you worked here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019ve worked here for a while. It\\u2019s a cool place to work.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cDid you know that our friend Levi works down at the shipping center?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t know he was down there. Sweet. One more person for me to sleep with!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, Kahenu works at this store with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I forgot that Kahenu was here. Awesome. One more person to sleep with!\\u201d This guy is pointing out to me all these people I know and I could sleep with. I\\u2019m totally stoked about it. Somehow, Jennifer Lopez shows up. She\\u2019s a fitness instructor for all the female employees. I\\u2019m watching her doing a workout and they\\u2019re all doing it with her. They\\u2019re all badass, totally kicking ass, covered in sweat from head to toe. They do have all their clothes on, but it\\u2019s bootie shorts and sports bras. For part of this workout, J Lo is in roller skates and some of it is coordinated because some of it is part of a music video. I watch them all working out, dripping sweat. Then she gets her roller skates and starts skating down the hill because this sports warehouse is at the top of the hill. All of these women, at least 25 if not more, are following her down the hill as part of this music video. I\\u2019m observing all of this and not making contact with all the people. I see Levi coming in and out of the building, but I don\\u2019t actually talk to him. I see Kahenu and start walking behind him. He turns around me and sees me and his eyes glaze over then get wide and he actually sees me, then he gets suspicious looking again. He turns around and keeps walking. I\\u2019m behind him and like, \\u201cHey you know me! Don\\u2019t pretend you don't know me.\\u201d Then the scene shifts one more time. I\\u2019m in a home, but now I\\u2019m in the observer role. I\\u2019m watching this woman who is pregnant with her third kid interact with the husband. The husband could give two fucking shit about her or the kids. She is trying so hard to engage him. She is being a super good mom. Her two little boys are probably 4 and 6 or maybe 5 and 3. They\\u2019re a little bit of a handful. She\\u2019s maybe 8 or 9 months pregnant and definitely putting on a persona of the cheerful, happy, bubbly wife. She\\u2019s also really, really short, maybe 4\\u20198 or 9 - not that much taller than her kiddos. Her husband is going off to work and she\\u2019s saying, \\u201cHey, have a nice day, honey!\\u201d His face is glued to his phone. I can tell that he\\u2019s on the phone texting a mistress or scrolling through pictures of other women. I have judgment around it. I\\u2019m also watching her trying to keep him engaged, and he\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYup, yup, going to work, bye, see you later.\\u201d I see him leaving and her trying to engage her two sons in play and learning like a home or unschooling situation.\"],[\"I\\u2019m heading home to the home I grew up in on the Big Island of Hawaii. I\\u2019m in a car. There are people with me, I think my siblings. It\\u2019s pouring rain - the kind where the roads are flooding. To get into the street that turns onto my cul-de-sac, we go over a stream. The stream is directly under the road but has come up over the road. I have to park the car. The siblings in the car are with me, but we\\u2019re not interacting - they\\u2019re kind of shadowed in the background. I have to get across the water to get into the cul-de-sac, so the car is parked. There are all these road workers here to help us. I get out and they\\u2019re very specific in showing me how to cross it. They\\u2019re going to help me get over it. They say, \\u201cThis part right here is deeper because the water has worn so much of the road away. But we\\u2019ve put some rocks down right here for you to walk across.\\u201d I get the sense that there\\u2019s also a small child with me because I\\u2019m being extra careful because I have to help them get across, too. I think it\\u2019s actually my son. The workers help us across this water and it is pretty deep, but because the rocks are there, it only goes up to our knees. Then we cross over and get onto the road. It stops raining and there\\u2019s no more water, but it is wet. We walk past a neighbor\\u2019s house. They have strawberry guava growing in their yard and it\\u2019s ripe. So I stop and I pick a bunch to eat and a bunch to take with me to save for later or turn into jam or jelly. I show my son and he\\u2019s eating some of them. We continue down the road. We walk down the road a little bit and turn right to head down the street to my house. So, we\\u2019re walking that way. We\\u2019ve hit the end where there\\u2019s a stop sign and we\\u2019re turning down to the right. To the left, I can see the horse pasture my friend used to have her horses in. I am recognizing all the houses and am like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m home, I\\u2019m home!\\u201d It feels good and normal. Then I\\u2019m walking down the street to our house. It\\u2019s different. Now my brothers have shown up. I don't think my sister is there, but we haven\\u2019t interacted yet. We get to the house. The house is different. The first thing we do is we all go into the backyard to see the stream because the stream we grew up with was such an important part of our lives, but we\\u2019d heard that our neighbor Andy had dug out his side of the stream. We get there and I look at it. The far side is a big wall that he dug out. It used to be that you could walk down the slope of our backyard into the stream and you could cross it to the other side and on the other side was a hill. There was a cow pasture and a barbed wire on the other side that you would have to cross, then walk up this hill or ridge. At the top you could see far out to a lava desert. But now, in the dream, that hill doesn\\u2019t exist. It\\u2019s just a rock wall. Instead of being flat where you could see the layers, it\\u2019s pebbled - you see this sometimes when you dig out all the layers of rock. The rocks are round and stacked on top of each other. They\\u2019re jutting out of the wall. My brothers are really sad that it\\u2019s been dug out. But I think it\\u2019s beautiful and also say, \\u201cOh my god, I dreamt about this. I dreamt this happened to the stream.\\u201d It\\u2019s created caves on the far side underneath the wall and I think it looks beautiful now. But my siblings are really upset. We turn around and it\\u2019s time to go into the house. My mom and dad are there, but the house has been changed. They live in separate parts of the house - my mom lives in the big part. Somehow there\\u2019s a sidewalk or the road is in between or underneath forming a causeway, and you have to cross the causeway to the part where my dad lives. My mom and dad are kind of getting along. They\\u2019re a little snippy with each other. But it\\u2019s clear that my mom never goes into my dad\\u2019s side. You have to go up these stairs and then walk across this causeway and it opens up into a room that\\u2019s above everything. The room looks like an attic and there\\u2019s enough stuff that it could be an attic. There are all these paintings, photographs and pictures nailed to the wall. What sticks out in my mind is that this little causeway I walk over is just plywood placed over a bunch of joists and it\\u2019s not particularly safe and the thought crosses my mind, \\u201cOh my dad is old and he shouldn\\u2019t be walking on this kind of floor where you have to walk on the joists so the plywood doesn\\u2019t tip up at the corners and come off.\\u201d It seems strange to me. My brothers are with me and we\\u2019re all going. Now my friend Dorian, who I grew up in this neighborhood, is with us, too. He\\u2019s there and keeps asking all these poignant questions. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to help me and my parents reconcile. That\\u2019s his role. He has a very loving presence. My whole life he had a loving presence, always very kind. This is radiating from him. So I look at this place where my dad is living. He says, \\u201cDo you like it? Do you like the way it\\u2019s decorated?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at all of these pictures. The walls are made of plywood and not painted, so the pictures are fading into the backaryd. There are all these pictures of ships and oceans with clouds over the top, like old-fashioned oil paintings. For whatever reason, the colors used for all three paintings match the same shades and tones of the plywood walls and they\\u2019re fading into the background. So I look at him and say, \\u201cIf you paint just this section with all the paintings white, you\\u2019ll be able to see the paintings better.\\u201d He crosses his arms in the way he used to and puts one hand up to his mouth and does the thing he used to do - stop and think and nod for a little bit. Then he moves out of the picture. Now my mom is front and center. We\\u2019re in the same space, but now the space has transformed and it\\u2019s hers. So my dad is there, but it\\u2019s not his space anymore. She has work to do. She always had work to do when we were growing up. There\\u2019s a computer on a desk that\\u2019s now in this space and piles of paperwork. But she also has piles of makeup. She says, \\u201cOh I have to get to a trial. Doyou think you can help me look good for this trial?\\u201d When I was growing up, I always thought my mom did her makeup so shitty because she never changed the way she did it from the 60s - weird blue eyeshadow and clumpy mascara. She just didn\\u2019t have a lot of skill with her makeup. So in the dream, she\\u2019s asking me to do it, because she knows I know how to do makeup. I\\u2019m looking at all this makeup she has. She has ten or twelve of the exact same eyeshadows and lip creams and all these things she wouldn\\u2019t wear because they are way too bright - they\\u2019re not the right color. She also has this makeup brush I need to use. So I put all this foundation on her face to smooth out her skin. It\\u2019s thick and way too much. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMom, if you\\u2019re going to have me do this, y0ou need to trust me and let me rub this in.\\u201d So I take this brush and I\\u2019m trying to rub it in. She\\u2019s sort of fighting me about it and I\\u2019m getting exasperated. I say, \\u201cStop, let me do this. You asked me to do this. Stop.\\u201d My friend Darisu is there and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, let her do this. You\\u2019re going to have to trust her to rub the makeup in.\\u201d I finally get her face to be a blank slate with all the foundation. It takes a while with this one brush. In the meantime I ask her why she has twelve of this one compact. She looks at my dad and says, \\u201cWell, he was trying to order me a surprise, but he ordered like twelve of them and now I have twelve of these things I never use.\\u201d In my head, I think, \\u201cThat was always your relationship. He was always trying to do nice, kind things for you, but he got it wrong by just a little bit. It would have been lovely if he had ordered the right amount and the right shade of these compacts, but instead he ordered twelve of a color you can never use. But instead of you communicating to him that you didn\\u2019t like that, you just got annoyed with him, rolled your eyes and totally disrespected him.\\u201dIn the dream, I\\u2019m watching that dynamic play out. I want out of it. It\\u2019s not my business. I can tell it\\u2019s them. I was thinking it was just her normal hoarding habits, but it turns out it came from my dad, at least in this aspect of the dream. We go to where her eyeshadows are because it\\u2019s time for me to do her eyes. She has a ton of different colors. I know that is actually her. In this part, she just wanted all of these things for herself. So I pick out an eyeshadow. What\\u2019s fascinating is I pick out this blue that is dark blue glitter, drag queen style. She\\u2019s looking at me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cJust trust me.\\u201d So I goto put it on and she keeps flinching and moving out of the way. Dorian tells her, \\u201cYou have to hold still. You have to trust her. Let her do this.\\u201d In the meantime, I\\u2019m concentrating so hard to put this eyeshadow on her and make her look nice, I get the sense that we\\u2019re running out of time because she has to hurry up and get to the trial. There\\u2019s also a part when we had gone into the house, there were a couple of cats. These cats are small like house cats but their fur looks like a cheetah - wild cats - and there\\u2019s one here. I\\u2019m talking to it and looking at it. It\\u2019s talking back as a sentient guide in this dream. It\\u2019s acting like a human. It\\u2019s got a pink underlayer. It\\u2019s fur is almost holographic, so it turns pink when it moves, but it still has the cheetah spots. I look up and there\\u2019s this cat print or motif in this attic/annex that she\\u2019s in that has all her makeup, work desk and other stuff. It\\u2019s very striking to me, because at one point in the dream, the cat wants to be held. I\\u2019m holding and petting it, but it\\u2019s purring and chewing on my finger and telling me stories. When I\\u2019m doing my mom\\u2019s makeup, I see this cat print everywhere - on the pillows, the wall, upholstering of a chair. She\\u2019s wearing some, too. I finally finished with her makeup and am not sure if this looks good because she wouldn't let me do it the way I wanted to do. But she\\u2019s gotta go. She says thank you and goes off to the trial. Then the dream changes completely and I\\u2019m with a friend. She\\u2019s a business coach. She takes me to one of her client\\u2019s houses and her client is doing quite well and so is the client\\u2019s husband because they live in a really nice house. I can see the ocean out of the windows and off the balcony of their house. The inside is very modern looking and minimalist, so there\\u2019s not a lot in it in contrast to my parents\\u2019 house. There are beautiful wood floors and tall walls with tall windows. The walls are painted grey and the furniture is black. It\\u2019s all elegant, very understated and minimalistic. There\\u2019s a gathering of people because this woman is telling her story of how she got to be a wealthy business woman. I\\u2019m in the audience. She talks about how hard she works and how she couldn\\u2019t have done it without my friend who is the business coach. Then the business coach says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you talk with Cinnamon?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m talking with this woman and her husband. They want to know what I do and how I got to what I\\u2019m doing. I tell the whole story of all the different aspects of my life that came together to this point of where I\\u2019m a priestess who helps people be in their bodies and how that happened through me getting a degree in exercise science and nutrition. She says, \\u201cOh, your story is very similar to mine. The only difference is I\\u2019m making a ton of money.\\u201dI look at her and am like, \\u201cYup, I just haven\\u2019t cracked that money thing yet. Haven\\u2019t figured that out.\\u201d My coach is like, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m having you meet her and tell the story because i wanted you to see how exactly similar the two of you are. You could do it at any point.\\u201d The husband was listening to the story and very supportive. Both of them are people of color. She may be Asian and he could maybe have some Arab blood. In the meantime, I can hear and see the ocean. It\\u2019s gotten stormy outside and there\\u2019s whitecaps on the water. But even though the house is very close to the edge of the water, I feel safe. I\\u2019m not too worried about the water coming up, but I can see it spraying up on the windows, which is very interesting. There\\u2019s a seagull outside trying to find a place to nest and land out of the wind. This is happening while she is telling her story and I am telling my story. Then at some point, I am sitting down. There is a sense of magic in this dream - as if these two people are my guides or my guides are orchestrating it or there are guides in the audience. I turn from our conversation and to a computer. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019ve been having conversations with other people. I look at the screen and see my friend Maria. She and I are having a flirtation through the computer screen. I can\\u2019t remember all the things we said, but I get the feeling of space and distance between us that is happening in real life - we are no longer friends in real life. I\\u2019m asking her, \\u201cWhere are you? Why aren\\u2019t we friends? Why aren\\u2019t we hanging out together?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember her response. Also, somewhere in the dream, I\\u2019m having a conversation with my dad and he\\u2019s talking about Doug who is a guy who used to work for my mom. They have a condo that they bought together with somebody else. My dad keeps saying that Doug owes him money for the condo. I keep saying, \\u201cNobody has any money. What are you going to do about it?\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cWell the option has always been that he can pay money or do somworktrade to live there and his roommate can pay money.\\u201d I find it interesting that work trade is on the table as an option for living in this condo.\"],[\"I am with a young man in his late teens or early twenties. We\\u2019re in a hotel room. I\\u2019m switching between observer and in the dream. I\\u2019m younger, closer to his age, and I think we\\u2019re involved. I\\u2019m lying on the hotel bed. It\\u2019s almost like we\\u2019re trying to earn our freedom from a mafia-type organization. We have a chaperone, an older matronly woman who reminds me of my mom, who has the adjoining bedroom. There\\u2019s another man who comes in - he is the head of the mafia. He\\u2019s saying to the young man I\\u2019m with, \\u201cYou have to prove your worth and your smarts to get out of the contract you owe the mafia for your freedom and ability to be with her (me) and to choose.\\u201d This is the part where I move into the observer role. I\\u2019m watching as this young man performs his first task. He has to orchestrate something where he can sneak away and not be caught. There are other people who are loyal to the boss watching him, on one hand to support him in getting away, and on the other hand to stop him and report him to the boss. It\\u2019s very interesting - an initiation and test where the people involved are both rooting for this young man and going to stop him at any cost. So now we\\u2019re outside the bedroom and I\\u2019m watching him in what looks like a mall or airport bathroom with lots of stalls and entrances on two sides. He\\u2019s in there and trying to grab a pair of shoes to be able to get away. There are lockers and in one of the lockers are the mafia boss\\u2019 shoes - a very specific pair of shoes, white and made of hard plastic material. They are very precious to the boss. This younger man is trying to get them because if he can get those shoes and the car, he will have passed the test. I\\u2019m watching him plan and be very sneaky and strategic. He\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cThe henchmen patrol this area at this time, so if I time it this way, I\\u2019ll miss their patrol and be able to grab these shoes.\\u201d I watch him plan it and then he does it. The boss knows that it\\u2019s going down but is letting it happen. He\\u2019s observing this whole thing, because he knows the kid needs to prove himself. So the young man does get the shoes and rescue me from wherever I was - maybe I was left in the hotel room. We run off together and then the dream shifts completely. Now it\\u2019s just me. I\\u2019m in a room - it looks like an abandoned warehouse you\\u2019d find in the industrial area. There are a bunch of millenials, or maybe even younger, maybe twenty year olds. There are two groups. I\\u2019m in there with all these kids. One group only has a handful of the younger kids. They are very conservative, kind of in shadow and wearing darker clothes, and their mannerisms are very reserved. The other group is much bigger with all kinds of people - all skin colors, ethnicities, gender identities or non-identifications, wearing various states of clothing or not. It is literally the gamut of young people. I\\u2019m standing with this group. There\\u2019s not a lot of distance between these two groups, maybe 10 feet, but I\\u2019m definitely standing with the group with all the diversity. They\\u2019re really loud and energetic. They are essentially all extraverts. While I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes! I like being with these high energy sovereign people,\\u201d I\\u2019m also overwhelmed by the sheer amount of energy each one is putting off. They are doing what they\\u2019re doing, no questions asked. It\\u2019s surprising to me because I know how to shield my own energy, but I\\u2019m just being swamped by the exuberance of this group who is celebrating who they are. I love this and I\\u2019m very clear that out of the two groups, I\\u2019m aligned with the group that knows who they are and isn\\u2019t taking any shit. But I also feel I need a little space. In this warehouse, they\\u2019re dancing, jumping around and making merry. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh! Too much! Overwhelm!\\u201d The dream shifts. This time I\\u2019m part of the dream and also observing. There\\u2019s an actor, Zachary Levi from \\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\u201d show. We\\u2019re in a room together. We\\u2019re sitting at a table and being served food in the warehouse. He\\u2019s been given a plate of rice stir fry and he\\u2019s eating it and thinking it\\u2019s okay. I\\u2019m tasting it, too, and say, \\u201cYeah, this is pretty good.\\u201d But there\\u2019s this cream of mushroom or salmon chowder option available. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cI like this one better.\\u201d He\\u2019s talking to someone who is the one organizing the food coming out on these tables. When he makes his preference, the person that\\u2019s been bringing the food out is really short and snippy. It\\u2019s a man chef. He\\u2019s not taking kindly to Levi\\u2019s preference even though he made both of these meals. Levi is just very innocently expressing his preference for this other soup. I\\u2019m mostly in the observer role here and not really interacting except to say once or twice, \\u201cNo, I actually also like that other soup better.\\u201d Then this is where the dream shifts again. I need to see my acupuncturist. It\\u2019s not that I\\u2019m not feeling well. I just know I need a few adjustments and an attunement of sorts. So my acupuncturist is the person I\\u2019m going to see. I\\u2019m going to get needles and he\\u2019s also a naturopath so I know that he\\u2019s got some other remedies and things up his sleeve and he\\u2019ll know exactly how to do the attunement. So I go to see him and I\\u2019m in his office - it\\u2019s him and his wife who is the receptionist. They\\u2019re diagnosing me and I\\u2019m telling them my symptoms, though I\\u2019m not sick. We\\u2019re in conversation. He and his wife confer a little bit. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, I think she needs this.\\u201d The naturopath says, \\u201cOkay, so here\\u2019s this one room where you can get ready, then meet me in this other room where I have all the equipment.\\u201d In the first room I have to take off all my clothes like you do for acupuncture. But usually you\\u2019re in the same room and you get under the blanket. In this case, I\\u2019m in one room, take off all my clothes, then walk to the other room totally naked. I don\\u2019t question it at all. I get to the other room and the naturopath says, \\u201cOkay, we need you to lay down here.\\u201d Instead of a treatment table, it\\u2019s a black futon couch, like every college student has ever had. It\\u2019s not laid out. It\\u2019s in the couch position. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure this is going to be very comfortable, but I\\u2019ll lay down here.\\u201d I lay down and the naturopath starts to put little nodes connected to wires on me. I can see my breasts and there are nodes on my breasts and I\\u2019m clear it\\u2019s for my heart. I\\u2019m starting to feel tired. He asks, \\u201cAre you comfortable?\\u201d He\\u2019s finished and is going to leave the room. I realize I want a blanket over me. I say, \\u201cNo, I want the blanket I came with. I brought a blanket that this hand-quilted. It\\u2019s all folded up and left it in the other room because I didn\\u2019t know I was going to need it. I really want that.\\u201d At this point, there are other people in the room, again these are younger people, maybe early twenties, maybe older teenagers. They\\u2019re observing. They are part of this healing attunement. I can see three of them and I get a sense that there\\u2019s more. They\\u2019re talking to the doctor and saying \\u201cPlease do a good job with her. We honor her very much and she needs to be taken care of. Don\\u2019t mess it up or put any needles in the wrong spot.\\u201d They\\u2019re very honoring in the way they speak of me, like I\\u2019ve done things for them that has helped them, and in return they want to make sure that I\\u2019m taken care of. So when I ask for my blanket, one of them goes back to get my blanket. They end up getting the wrong one, but it\\u2019s okay. I\\u2019m slowly being taken care of. They find the heat lamp and put it on me. They put a blanket on me. They just make sure that while I\\u2019m having this attunement, I\\u2019m warm and have everything I need. I leave the office feeling better. I\\u2019m looking at this house. It\\u2019s twilight The feature of the house that stands out the most is a huge front window that is lit up. I can see the light in this gloom that I\\u2019m in.\"],[\"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He\\u2019s very protective. I\\u2019m lying down on my back. I can\\u2019t tell where I am. There\\u2019s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I\\u2019m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I\\u2019m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I\\u2019m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it\\u2019s the time of coronavirus, people can\\u2019t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They\\u2019re gathered around me and I\\u2019m definitely still vulnerable because I\\u2019m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I\\u2019m telling them: \\u201cMy playlists are for pole classes. It\\u2019s not your normal CrossFit playlist.\\u201d They don\\u2019t care. They\\u2019re adamant that they get a workout. So, it\\u2019s either the man I\\u2019m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It\\u2019s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren\\u2019t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, \\u201cOkay, the winners get some of these ferrets.\\u201d During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s my kids or somebody else\\u2019s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I\\u2019m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they\\u2019re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn\\u2019t going to be what they thought. I\\u2019m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There\\u2019s this process I\\u2019m going through where I\\u2019m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they\\u2019re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can\\u2019t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they\\u2019re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I\\u2019m in the observer role. There\\u2019s a man and his son - I don\\u2019t know who they are. He\\u2019s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he\\u2019s very attentive. They\\u2019re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I\\u2019m not very neutral. I\\u2019m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it\\u2019s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he\\u2019s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, \\u201cWe need to take your son.\\u201d The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I\\u2019m fucking pissed. There\\u2019s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it\\u2019s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he\\u2019s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they\\u2019re basically not listening - they\\u2019re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man\\u2019s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that\\u2019s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a lead up to this scene, but it\\u2019s escaping me. It was connected because it set me up for the emotions. What I do remember is being in a room. I\\u2019m in charge of making a meal for these children that are coming in. It\\u2019s a soccer clinic and all of these younger children are a part of it. It\\u2019s a mix of boys and girls and I think they\\u2019re all between the ages of 8 and 12. I\\u2019m supposed to be preparing the food, but also making sure there\\u2019s enough for everyone. There\\u2019s probably 50 kids coming through to eat. I\\u2019m working on it. The deadline is getting closer for the time I need to have the food prepared. It\\u2019s not totally prepared. There\\u2019s an interesting piece happening here where I have a basket of feathers - they could be chicken and raven feathers. I am taking the feathers and sewing them one at a time onto this food and it makes the food more abundant. So, I\\u2019m full on doing spells here - totally witchy. I\\u2019m realizing I\\u2019m running out of time, though. This man I know comes in. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll help you get this fixed up.\\u201d He comes in. His energy is very jarring to me. He grabs a bunch of feathers, and instead of helping make the food more abundant, he starts on this art project with the feathers. He\\u2019s talking the whole time - fucking windbag taking us so much air and space. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe need to listen to this music,\\u2019 and he puts this music on. It\\u2019s kind of jazzy and reminds me of the band Pink Martini from Portland. He is ruining the flow and I don\\u2019t like it. Now I\\u2019m really not getting things done. The thing is he\\u2019s so earnest and he thinks he\\u2019s helping. But of course, my self-reflection is, oh why do you have to be a bitch about it? But he\\u2019s not fucking helping. And he\\u2019s just taking up so much space and hijacking it. The kids start to come in now. The food is not ready. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay kids! We\\u2019ve got plenty here!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cWe barely have enough to feed the ten that just showed up and there\\u2019s going to be forty more coming.\\u201d So the first ten come in, get their food and they\\u2019re eating what they have. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is fucked. I don\\u2019t have the rest of everything I need.\\u201d The magic spell was like fishes and loaves - I was making more food out of the food we had - and now I don\\u2019t have any more of the food base material to make more food with. So more children come in. They\\u2019re sitting at tables with their plates. They had to go to their spot, grab their plate, walk to the buffet line, then fill up their plate. Now all these kids have their plates, but their plates are empty and they\\u2019re looking at me. All that\\u2019s left are mashed sweet potatoes or yams. They\\u2019re looking at me and the bacon is all gone - the meat/protein is gone. There\\u2019s not other vegetables. It\\u2019s just this bit of sweet potatoes and there\\u2019s not enough for the kids that come in. They\\u2019re staring at me and I have the worst sinking feeling in my stomach because I can\\u2019t feed the kids. It\\u2019s because my super efficient and effective ways of making food stretch and last just got hijacked by this dude. I wake up feeling completely fucking irritated.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with some friends - one or two are high school friends, but some are co-workers. I\\u2019m at a grocery store and we\\u2019re stocking shelves and cleaning up. We\\u2019re in the breakroom, too. We have to clean up the store to prepare it for the next day. There\\u2019s an interesting split between how much the men and women are cleaning up. The work is getting done, but the small details keep getting missed by the men and the women clean up after them. The dream shifts a little bit out of the grocery store to another room, maybe a home because there\\u2019s a home office and what looks like a home entertainment room. I\\u2019m watching a man who is a BDSM trainer and you can book sessions with him. There\\u2019s also a gorgeous super curvy black woman and it\\u2019s her birthday. Her husband has booked a session with this pornstar BDSM trainer. His name is King Noire. She\\u2019s so freaking excited and it\\u2019s so cute to see her exclaim, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m going to get hit with a paddle!\\u201d She\\u2019s really excited that this is her birthday gift and her husband is excited for her, too. Now we\\u2019re in what looks like an underground garage. She\\u2019s in some short shorts with a skirt over top and a regular top on. She\\u2019s walking down a ramp. There are other people getting ready for the scene. She\\u2019s so excited. She drops her purse and when she goes to pick up her skirt, it rides up. She\\u2019s wearing shorts, so you can\\u2019t see anything, but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my!\\u201d Her husband is standing behind her. You can tell she is nervous and excited at the same time, but doesn\\u2019t know which way to go with it. So she heads down the ramp and disappears into the darkness of this underground garage. I think this is perfect and she\\u2019s getting what she needs. I\\u2019m observing that part. Then I become part of the dream. Now it\\u2019s me and it\\u2019s my birthday. The whole tone of the dream changes. I\\u2019m with the person - but they\\u2019re not actually King, the BDSM expert. I can\\u2019t tell the person\\u2019s face, but they\\u2019re a tall, muscular and strong male. There are other men around. Whoever I am with, he and I are flirting and he\\u2019s telling me he\\u2019s going to treat me good on my birthday. We\\u2019re in the entertainment center part of the house. There\\u2019s a huge movie projector and a movie playing and there are some really comfy big seats. He\\u2019s sitting in one of them and I\\u2019m sitting on his lap. Now the dream starts to feel weird because I\\u2019m watching these other men in this room with women - they\\u2019re chasing the women. It reminds me of scenes where you see a satyr chasing nymphs. But there\\u2019s an edge of danger that it may not be consensual. I see someone in front of me cracking a whip. I turn to the person whose lap I\\u2019m sitting on and ask, \\u201cDid you bring one of those for my birthday?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh yeah, don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay!\\u201d He\\u2019s tending me to give me what I want and he has his own desires but is holding them in check - I can feel it. There\\u2019s another scene where things start to shift. Now instead of being in this entertainment movie room, all of a sudden we\\u2019re in a different room. I feel like a sacrificial offering. Now King is there in the room. He\\u2019s sitting in front of a computer at a desk and I can\\u2019t tell if he\\u2019s editing film. I can see out a bunch of windows to skyscrapers - a city. I come up to him, put my arms around him and tell him, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m going to be okay.\\u201d He clenches his jaw and starts to pretend to headbutt people three times. He\\u2019s really tense and he\\u2019s gripping the computer mouse. His whole body is really tense. I ask, \\u201cAre you worried about me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, and I know you\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d I say again, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time for me to head down to this underground parking lot. King is walking me down the ramp. I go from light into the dark. He has to stop at a certain point, and now it\\u2019s just me going forward from this point on. Now the dream gets a little funny. It\\u2019s still me. There\\u2019s a group of men - all white men and their faces are covered and they\\u2019re wearing all black. They kind of look like the Ku Klux Klan, but they have black instead of white. There is leather and chains and spikes and a lot of weapons - knives, rope and chains. This is the part where I pop out. Now I\\u2019m watching myself. They\\u2019ve formed a semicircle and I\\u2019m walking down into the middle. They grab this material with straps and loops for their hands. They come around me in a circle and take this material. They open it up - it was folded like an accordian. When they open it up, it circles around me. I am enclosed in this darkness - this black fabric material that looks like a set of bat wings, but their hands are through the loops and they are closing it. That\\u2019s the last bit of the dream I see - myself being enclosed in this thing. I can feel King or my Lover behind me is tense and not okay with it. But this is something I\\u2019m supposed to be doing - being a sacrifice. There will be pain, but it is consensual. But there is an edge of darkness as it is not a consensus between two people, but there are larger forces at play. King keeps acting like it\\u2019s out of his control.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know from waking life, but in the dream I recognize them as co-workers. We\\u2019re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they\\u2019re working. I work there, too, but I\\u2019m there on my day off. We\\u2019re talking. I\\u2019m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I\\u2019m barefoot and I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There\\u2019s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don\\u2019t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I\\u2019m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There\\u2019s some other way that I\\u2019m helping these co-workers. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an energetic helping or if I\\u2019m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They\\u2019re both younger women. I\\u2019m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn\\u2019t super clear. I just know I\\u2019m in the store with them and we\\u2019re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I\\u2019m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I\\u2019ve been hanging out with say, \\u201cOh, we have something for you.\\u201d All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we\\u2019re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There\\u2019s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don\\u2019t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, \\u201cWe have these shoes for you.\\u201d These boots are pretty incredible. They\\u2019re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I \\u2018m looking at these boots, the heel doesn\\u2019t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It\\u2019s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I\\u2019m so, so tall. I love them and they\\u2019re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I\\u2019m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re that tall in those shoes. That\\u2019s how tall you are. That\\u2019s who you are.\\u201d But I\\u2019m surprised. I didn\\u2019t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I\\u2019ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There\\u2019s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It\\u2019s an interesting mix because we\\u2019re in quarantine and we can\\u2019t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I\\u2019m thinking that for someone who\\u2019s never driven a huge tour bus before, he\\u2019s doing a pretty good job. I don\\u2019t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I\\u2019m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it\\u2019s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I\\u2019m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I\\u2019m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it\\u2019s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren\\u2019t going to tip him. I say, \\u201cYou have to tip him. That\\u2019s how this works.\\u201d I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it\\u2019s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I\\u2019m not stoked to be there. I\\u2019m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there\\u2019s stuff everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I\\u2019m somewhere I don\\u2019t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There\\u2019s definitely friction here. I\\u2019m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.\"],[\"There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I\\u2019m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I\\u2019m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It\\u2019s showing up in flashes. There\\u2019s one part where I\\u2019m in an airport. I\\u2019m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It\\u2019s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don\\u2019t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It\\u2019s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I\\u2019m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There\\u2019s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I\\u2019m sorting of chatting with. I\\u2019m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I\\u2019m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that\\u2019s happened. I can\\u2019t find my sweater. We\\u2019ve landed and it\\u2019s time to disembark but I can\\u2019t find my sweater. I\\u2019ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we\\u2019ve landed and I\\u2019m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can\\u2019t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn\\u2019t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn\\u2019t look quite human. So, there\\u2019s this sense that I\\u2019m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don\\u2019t want to be because I don\\u2019t know where I am. I get on a tram. It\\u2019s more like a train that will take us to our destination. I feel out of place. I don\\u2019t know where I am - this place is new, this tram is new, I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going. Even though I\\u2019m part of this group, I don\\u2019t know all the people around me, It\\u2019s just a little uncomfortable and I feel disoriented. Then I come out of that part of the dream into another part where my ex\\u2019s presence is around. He\\u2019s not in the dream with me, but he\\u2019s been around. We\\u2019ve definitely been divorced. I\\u2019m agitated because he\\u2019s pulled more super controlling shit. I\\u2019m just wanting so badly to get away from this person, to get out from under his thumb, to not have to interact with him in any way. In the dream he does have the kids. It\\u2019s just me in the dream, but there\\u2019s a sense of him being around with the kids. I feel like I\\u2019m under surveillance as if he has cameras on me. I don\\u2019t even know where I am. I think it\\u2019s a house, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave the house and go out into town. There\\u2019s a building that is a retail shop. Things are sold out of it, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure what. I need to go there because there\\u2019s a desk that I\\u2019m trying to fix. What\\u2019s interesting is my dad shows up. The front of the retail shop is all these floor to ceiling windows. A lot of them have been broken - someone was throwing bottles or rocks. There\\u2019s glass everywhere in the entry area. I need to go in. I know this shop is owned by my ex and his father. There\\u2019s something about a desk that I need to get or repair. Or I need to get something from that shop. My dad is there and trying to sweep up all the broken glass. My dad is actually part owner of the shop, or maybe he owns the land that the shop is on. I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s super ineffective with his broom, so I just grab a broom and start sweeping. Between the two of us we get the glass picked up. The glass is in tiny, tiny pieces - not quite sand, but pebble size. It didn't break in big chunks - it broke like safety glass into little round pieces without sharp edges. The entryway is paved in cobblestone, so the glass is getting stuck in the grooves. We sweep up all the glass and I don\\u2019t know what we do with it. I go inside the retail shop and walk in through one of the broken windows rather than the door. There\\u2019s the desk that I need. I go to pick it up and move it and it just falls apart. I look underneath and the structure of it is crumbling. It\\u2019s like that really thin pressed board that cheap furniture is made out of and if it gets wet, it swells and disintegrates. It\\u2019s made of that stuff. I\\u2019m underneath the desk and trying to fix it. I ask my dad for help. He hands me a roll of duct tape. I try to duct tape it back together. I\\u2019m working on it and wondering why I\\u2019m trying to fix this desk. It\\u2019s my ex\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t want it, why am I fixing his shit? This desk is not going to provide what I need and is not the thing that I actually need. I come up from under the desk and there are other sturdy pieces of furniture made of real wood. I can see them and I\\u2019m comparing them to this desk. I have this sense of, \\u201cOh god, please make sure that my ex or his dad do not show up at this shop while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I have their permission, but don\\u2019t want to interact with them and their super controlling, contemptuous attitudes of disgust. I know I don\\u2019t want to be there when they arrive, so I\\u2019m trying to hurry.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I see a customer that I see often in waking realm. He\\u2019s there, too. It\\u2019s time for me to get off work. I\\u2019m leaving and he\\u2019s checking out with his groceries. I get in my car - it\\u2019s a Jeep with the top of. He gets in his car. We end up driving next to each other in our cars. It\\u2019s weird that the road is wide enough for us both because it\\u2019s a two-lane highway. Somehow the lane we\\u2019re in is wide enough for both of us to be driving side by side. I\\u2019m kind of like, \\u201cCome on dude, let me get in front, or let me get behind. I don\\u2019t want to be driving side by side with you.\\u201d We end up driving toward the same place. It\\u2019s a gated community where he lives. For some reason, I\\u2019m going with him. His face looks like the classic bad guy in martial arts movies. In fact, I think he looks a lot like an actor. His face is heavy brow, heavy jaw, very square, heavy nose that looks like it\\u2019s been broken a few times. I\\u2019m not attracted in any way. We roll up onto this gated community. It looks like it has a bunch of duplexes in it. We roll through the gate. There\\u2019s a school - a college campus of sorts - too. I park my car and feel like I\\u2019m going to head into school or into my home. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, get in. I\\u2019m going to give you a ride.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t need a ride anywhere.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m going to drive you someplace.\\u201d Part of me is like, \\u201cFuck no, I don\\u2019t want to get in a car with you.\\u201d The other part of me is like, \\u201cOh okay, I guess we\\u2019ll see where we\\u2019re going with this.\\u201d I hop in and we\\u2019re driving around. He starts telling me about his kids. We had a conversation at the grocery store about his children. I had watched him while I was at the grocery store. I was shopping, too, and it wasn\\u2019t my place of work. I had been people watching, specifically parents, and watching the way they talked to their children and noticing that parents are so controlling and rude and disrespectful of their children and didn\\u2019t let children be who they wanted me to be. I remember watching him specifically and he was really harsh and militant with his kids and I was like, \\u201cOh my god, you\\u2019re squishing their light.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t say it out loud, but I remember thinking that. I was not impressed with the way he was parenting. I think that was my hesitation when we ended up driving next to each other, side by side. So, I got in the car anway, and we ended up talking about parenting in the car. He was driving all around this gated community and there was snow everywhere. Then he parks in some place. There's this weird potential of a sexual thing. I\\u2019m so grossed out about it. I can feel the bile rising in my throat when I think about it. He puts music on so we can dance, like he\\u2019s going to try and maybe seduce me with dancing. I\\u2019m so not having it at all. This younger woman comes out of one of the buildings we parked near. She - her skin - is all gold. She begins dancing to the music. I\\u2019m dancing to the music by myself - I\\u2019m trying to keep space between me and this dude. She\\u2019s beautiful to watch dancing. I\\u2019m loving the dancing, too. He starts to creep up on her and I\\u2019m trying to tell her to get away from him and don\\u2019t let him come up and steal your gold your light. He tries to touch her and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw, no, get away!\\u201d I think she eventually moves away and off into the background. He doesn\\u2019t ever actually get to touch her, which is good. It\\u2019s now just he and me again. We get back in the car because he goes to drop me off somewhere. He does this crazy thing where he slams on the gas and then lets off the gas and he turns the car so we\\u2019re sliding. It looks and feels like a move from the movies where you see a car changing direction really fast. He goes to drop me off near my car. Now instead of it being my car, it\\u2019s a rack of bicycles that you\\u2019d found in a complex full of college kids who have only bikes to get themselves around. He drops me off there like that\\u2019s my car. I\\u2019m annoyed because it is so not my car and my car is far away from where we are. Instead, it ends up being his house. I go into the house and he goes to park his Jeep car thing. I go into the house and there\\u2019s a bunch of coolers. I think at some point, he\\u2019s going to come in and show me around the house. But I\\u2019m in the house alone and the house feels funny. It\\u2019s all white - white carpet and white walls - kind of like rentals. It looks like an 80\\u2019s house with glass window with super wide plastic blinds. The coolers are in this living room area. I have to step down two steps to get to this area because it\\u2019s one of those sunken living rooms. I go to the coolers. One of them is mine and I\\u2019m hungry, so I\\u2019m trying to dig through it. There are other coolers. One of the coolers belongs to my hula sister\\u2019s parents. The other cooler belongs to another person I know. I\\u2019m digging through trying to find food and also rearranging the coolers while I\\u2019m at it. Then this dude walks by. He\\u2019s been telling me about his wife the whole time, too. He says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you meet the lady of the house?\\u201d I still don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m in this house. It feels weird. When I look up at the doors I came through, they are these huge garage doors that lead to the garage where he parked the car. There\\u2019s the number 32 sticking out from the side and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s a very Harry Potter moment.\\u201d At some point, Dobby the elf from Harry Potter, shows up. It gets a bit weird. I don\\u2019t know what Dobby does, except he\\u2019s just there. I follow the dude into this kitchen and his kids are not home, but I\\u2019m wondering where they are. I\\u2019ve seen them with him at the grocery store, but they\\u2019re not here now. His wife is there. I walk into the kitchen because he\\u2019s going to introduce me to her. They\\u2019re in the middle of a conversation. His whole demeanor has changed and he\\u2019s very loving husband. He was not like that before. Before he was militant dad and when he was driving me around places and dancing, he was like weird controlling trying to seem like he knew what was going on and being sexy lover man and I was not having that. But now I\\u2019m watching him interact with his wife. He\\u2019s somewhat disrespectful. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re both using each other and they know it, or they both know they\\u2019re faking this husband and wife thing and living in a house with kids thing, and they know it and going with it anyway. He says, \\u201cOh my wife is so young.\\u201d Then I hear her say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m so young. People always want to know how I have a 25 year old child, but I\\u2019m 19.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! The math doesn\\u2019t work.\\u201d She turns around and she does not look young. She\\u2019s in her forties and her face is pockmarked and wrinkled. She has longer blonde hair to her midback. She\\u2019s thin. Her skin is tan. She\\u2019s going on and on about how young she is and trying to explain to me the math about how she has these older kids and how when her kids were babies, she was so young and she didn\\u2019t have anyone to raise her kids with and it was hard, but now she\\u2019s very wise because she had kids when she was so young. My brain is just not computing all of this. Throughout this entire dream, \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d is going through my head. We\\u2019re in their kitchen. The dude is sitting at an island/bar. She\\u2019s at the sink and she has turned around and is talking to me. She has poured herself a fat glass of wine - like half the bottle into a wine glass. I think she\\u2019s given him the other one. This is clearly their wind down ritual where they reconnect with each other. The whole thing is so bizarre. I wake up from the dream and am like, \\u201cEw, why did I dream that?!\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We\\u2019re outside and there\\u2019s a picnic table. I think there\\u2019s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We\\u2019re a part of that. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She\\u2019s hosting. I\\u2019m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They\\u2019re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it\\u2019s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There\\u2019s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I\\u2019m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I\\u2019m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they\\u2019re saying and learn from them. I think I\\u2019m really not welcome here. I don\\u2019t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I\\u2019m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It\\u2019s getting heated. They\\u2019re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I\\u2019m feeling all of these emotions. I\\u2019m pissed that that\\u2019s their reality and mine. I\\u2019m pissed that I feel like there\\u2019s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it\\u2019s more equal and fair for everyone. I\\u2019m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I\\u2019m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They\\u2019re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they\\u2019re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, \\u201cHey, I want you two to know that I\\u2019ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you\\u2019re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don\\u2019t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I\\u2019m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn\\u2019t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can\\u2019t tell if they appreciate what I\\u2019m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I\\u2019m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There\\u2019s a wooded forest behind me. There\\u2019s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I\\u2019m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they\\u2019re young. I\\u2019m a young adult in this place, or I\\u2019m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They\\u2019re playing and they\\u2019re hungry. They want something to eat. There\\u2019s a guy and in my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201coh my god, pedophile.\\u201d I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they\\u2019re playing. The kids say they\\u2019re really hungry and the guy is like, \\u201cWell, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019re all hungry. There\\u2019s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don\\u2019t even know where it\\u2019s plugged into. It\\u2019s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don\\u2019t want to take the meat from this guy because I don\\u2019t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He\\u2019s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he\\u2019s watching them play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t even watch them play.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it\\u2019s safer. I don\\u2019t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I\\u2019m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that\\u2019s right after me. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re talking about. We are in a different place. They\\u2019re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they\\u2019re in is devoid of trees. It\\u2019s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn\\u2019t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I\\u2019m talking to them and I\\u2019m checking in with them. But part of me doesn\\u2019t want to be talking about this with them because they\\u2019re not listening to me. They\\u2019re not hearing me. I\\u2019m not getting a say. I\\u2019m not getting to use my voice about this. They\\u2019re just telling me how things are. I\\u2019m annoyed because that\\u2019s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They\\u2019re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they\\u2019re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, \\u201cDo you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?\\u201d But they\\u2019re not listening and not open to it. I\\u2019m not saying anything. I\\u2019m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I\\u2019m working in the frozen and dairy section. I\\u2019ve just arrived and I\\u2019m talking to the manager and she is giving me the rundown of all the things that need to be done today. She says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s your coat.\\u201d There\\u2019s an extra coat for me to wear because it\\u2019s cold in the freezer and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cHere\\u2019s some music you can listen to.\\u201d That\\u2019s awesome. I get ready to get all my stuff and go. I\\u2019m not sure if we\\u2019re in the breakroom when she\\u2019s giving me all this stuff. I walk out of that place. All of a sudden I have to get to the cooler to grab all the stuff out of the cooler to stock it. I\\u2019m in this gigantic huge grand ballroom. It\\u2019s like a maze. There are areas I\\u2019m trying to get through. A gala is happening. There\\u2019s a huge party. I have to go get the frozen or dairy foods for the party. I have to pull it out, so now I\\u2019m catering. It\\u2019s being put on by my brothers or a family member, maybe my mom. My mom actually does put on events in real life. So I\\u2019m trying to make my way to the cooler. It\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s either so packed I can't move or I\\u2019m trying to obey the 6 feet distance rule and I\\u2019m having a hard time trying to get through the crowd and to the cooler. I have this cart - the carts we use in the back to load up our stuff. I\\u2019m trying to make my way, but then I hear the M.C. go: \\u201cAnd now, for our special guest, Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\u201d Sure enough, I look towards this doorway where people are coming in and out of. By the way, this is happening in a grand ballroom and there\\u2019s also a lawn and patio where this event is also happening. It\\u2019s a very big event. In the ballroom, the ceilings are so high I can\\u2019t even see the ceiling. The doorways are so tall, as you would see in a ballroom, that it takes a lot of effort just to open one door because the doors are so big and heavy. So these doors are open. The M.C. has announced Arnold Schwarzenegger and he walks through. What strikes me is the couple that walks before him, I think is my mom and dad, but it doesn\\u2019t look like them because these people are way tall and my parents aren\\u2019t particularly tall. Then, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his date or his wife walk through, also very tall. And then my brother and his fiancee walk through the door. My brother is just as tall as Arnold Schwarzenegger, so there are all these really tall people. I am sort of having this proud moment because I feel like this party or event is one my mom put on, but my brother is part of it and he made it happen. This was his vision and now here he is walking through the doors with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then the next thought that goes through my head is like, \\u201cWow, is Arnold Schwarzenegger such a B-List celebrity that he would agree to come to this gala event put on by my parents and brother?\\u201d Anyway, Arnold Schwarzenegger looks older, but not as old as he looks now. Then I am back to trying to get to the cooler so I can grab the stuff and bring it out for this party. The dream switches here. It goes from a beautiful gala party event with flower party arrangements and gold on the doors and on the walls, and the beautiful sconces and chandeliers, and just a very opulent setting to kind of dark, at least the lighting gets dark. I am watching these other people try to take over the ball. They have headsets on and they\\u2019re in a room where they\\u2019re watching everything on screens. They are trying to manage the ball from behind the scenes. They\\u2019re letting this centipede like creature with a round body- it\\u2019s like a toy from the 80s, that you could build bugs with, their bodies were really round and they have these yellow curly cue tongues and antennas and yellow peg legs you can put into the round bodies and make whatever size bug you wanted from these things. So, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m watching these people do - they are going to let this bug loose on the party. But it\\u2019s a super poisonous bug like a centipede with a ton of legs. I\\u2019m still trying to do my part. But now I realize I need to stop this bug because if they let this bug go and it stings everyone, it\\u2019s going to be chaos and it\\u2019s not good. In my mind I think this bug is going to kill people. So I actually pick it up behind it\\u2019s first bulbous round head thing. It\\u2019s trying to move through the party, going back through the doors the others came out of. It\\u2019s getting bigger and smaller, changing size. When it\\u2019s in its small phase, I pick it up and it leaves one of its segments behind. I\\u2019m just really horrified that this bug is being let loose and I\\u2019m trying to contain it. When I do pick it up, it shrinks down to its toy size, even though it leaves its segments behind. But it\\u2019s still really poisonous. I don\\u2019t want the front end of it to get anywhere near to me - kind of like when you grab a snake behind the head so it can\\u2019t bite you, I\\u2019m trying to keep it from biting me and everyone else. There\\u2019s a little bit of panic and suspicion now going through the party. It was very joyful and joyous with the clink of china and all that stuff happening to silence and panic and fear, definitely fear. And the lighting is now dark.\"],[\"Holy shit, this dream. And dreams within dreams. The deepest dream starts with me and all six of my high school classmates - two or three women and two or three men. They\\u2019re putting on a hula show for an audience. I don\\u2019t know who is in the audience. I haven\\u2019t learned it yet. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? How don\\u2019t I know this? Why didn\\u2019t you teach me? Out of all of us, I\\u2019m the actual hula dancer.\\u201d They are like, \\u201cWell, because you dance hula, you\\u2019ll be able to pick it up. But we\\u2019re going on stage now.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, right.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have the costume. Can you at least dance it for me at least once?\\u201d They find lei for me and costume for me. Interestingly enough, the costume is a bleached white pareo on the bottom. I don\\u2019t know what we have on top - I think nothing, just lei and lei on our head and kupe\\u2019e on our wrist and feet. I keep saying, \\u201cCan you show me the dance? Where in the lineup do I need to be for all of this?\\u201d We\\u2019re heading out onto the stage. The stage has maybe two inches of water on it and water all around it. The audience is on the other side of the water. We\\u2019re going to be dancing in the water. But I still don\\u2019t know the dance all the way, and none of my classmates are forthcoming. I get the sense that they\\u2019re bummed that I showed up and they were going to do the dance without me. They didn\\u2019t want me there. The reason they didn\\u2019t teach it to me is that they didn\\u2019t want me there upstaging them. This is such a strange thing in my mind. I don\\u2019t understand in my mind why as a class we\\u2019re presenting this hula to everyone and they\\u2019re trying to keep me out of it. Then the dream shifts to me being an observer. There is a dream oracle - he's like Edward - and a husband and wife. The wife looks like Julia Roberts. The man looks like a very stereotypical college professor type white man with the sweater and the khakis and loafers and glasses. This couple has come to see this dream oracle. They\\u2019re in a library - the dream oracle\\u2019s personal library with floor to ceiling books and lots of gold. It\\u2019s really ornate with all kinds of filigree style decorations of wall sconces and velvet chairs. It\\u2019s very opulent. The dream oracle is going to help them work through their dreams. The dream oracle explains to them how dreams work. You can see the man is very, very skeptical. But the wife is like, \\u201cOf course, it totally makes sense that dreams work this way - that they are hidden messages with multiple layers and that they come from other realms.\\u201d The husband is like, \\u201cWhatever, this is a bunch of bullshit.\\u201d This is where there is a dream within a dream. I watch them go into a dreamstate. In the dreamstate, the husband and wife are very lovely dovey. They\\u2019re in an open field with clouds. The husband just goes psycho. There\\u2019s another man there. I\\u2019m not sure who or what he is. The husband turns into a psycho as his wife watches. His true nature comes out in this dreamstate. He\\u2019s not just an animal, he\\u2019s cruel. This other man that shows up in the dream, he cuts his head off. The blood sprays all over the wife. The wife starts to freak out. This is where they\\u2019re in the dream together. So even though she\\u2019s freaking out, I can hear her say, \\u201cThis is just a dream, it\\u2019s not real.\\u201d The husband is trying to kiss her, but he\\u2019s very violent about it. He\\u2019s grabbed her hair. He\\u2019s covered in blood and he has a knife in his hand from when he cut the head off the other person in this dream. They come out of the dream together. They\\u2019re back in the dream oracle\\u2019s study. She\\u2019s horrified. I'm horrified. I\\u2019m looking at the husband and can tell that the dream completely revealed who he actually was. Maybe it was just a dream, but maybe it was the realest thing because now they can see who the husband is. He\\u2019s this violent guy, not the stereotypical well-spoken professor that he showed up as. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m no longer an observer. I\\u2019m back in my body. There\\u2019s a woman. She\\u2019s older than me. In this part of the dream, I\\u2019m younger, maybe 12 or 13 at least. She has a ton of books. She\\u2019s selling books. I\\u2019m outside with her. The books are on this round wooden table with a single leg in the middle. She goes door to door selling books and she\\u2019s showing me how to sell books to make money. She has dark hair that touches her shoulders. Her face is friendly. I get the sense she is not of this world. I\\u2019m trying to take in everything she says about selling the books, but I have this weird sense that things are not as they seem. I have my bicycle and there\\u2019s a little basket on the front. It doesn\\u2019t have any gears - it\\u2019s an old-fashioned bike with a banana seat. I\\u2019m putting some of the books in the front so we can go door to door and sell these books. I don\\u2019t know exactly what\\u2019s in them. She\\u2019s trying to tell me what\\u2019s in them, but I\\u2019m not remembering. So I\\u2019m younger in this part of the dream, but then the dream goes forward and now I\\u2019m probably 18-12. I\\u2019m college-aged. Now I\\u2019m with Josh, current lover in waking life, and his girlfriend. We\\u2019re all going to college together. He\\u2019s registering for courses. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m here because I\\u2019ve already been to college and don\\u2019t like college. I already have two degrees and don\\u2019t want to be here. What\\u2019s heartbreaking for me is that he\\u2019s with his girlfriend and they\\u2019re registering for classes together and I hear him say, \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s so many people here to meet and sleep with!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, I\\u2019m going to register for all my classes.\\u201d The thought crosses my mind, \\u201cWhy are you even here with him registering for classes? You\\u2019ve already got your degrees? And why are you registering for all of these undergrad courses. If you\\u2019re going to go back to school, get your PhD.\\u201d My response to that is like, I don\\u2019t want to do that. I don\\u2019t need a PhD. I don\\u2019t need to go to classes to get a PhD. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m here. I\\u2019m only here because I followed this guy here. And now he\\u2019s off and encouraging me to go meet a bunch of people. But I\\u2019m like, I don\\u2019t need you to tell me that. I don\\u2019t need your permission. I\\u2019m questioning why we\\u2019re even here together. I decide to write the whole thing off and try to make it my own. The dream shifts one more time. College is still part of it. Now my mom is here. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey honey, I got you some shoes. They were giving shoes away to low income people.\\u201d I guess I qualify as a low income person. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know if I need any shoes.\\u201d But I look. They\\u2019re these oxfords with the heel and front toe a dark maroon and the rest of the shoe is light pink. The colors go well together and the shoes are cute for low income. But I\\u2019m not expecting any shoes. I don\\u2019t need any shoes. I don\\u2019t feel like a low income person and don\\u2019t know why I need these shoes. They\\u2019re cute but I don\\u2019t actually want them. I wake up thinking that I don\\u2019t want any of this. I feel like I\\u2019m not following my path. I recall how the woman selling the books was telling me I need to do my own thing. I had this sense of frustration and my jaw was tight and tired as if I was grinding my teeth in the dream because I was playing catch up or doing something I didn\\u2019t want to do or I\\u2019m doing something that is not at my level. I get the sense that I\\u2019ve learned all this stuff and am repeating all of these patterns, but it\\u2019s time to move on and stop taking what\\u2019s offered to me as if there aren\\u2019t other things being offered to me or other things I could be taken advantage of. The feeling of being irritated stays with me.\"],[\"This is the deeper part of the dream that I\\u2019m only remembering flashes of. I\\u2019m with my high school classmates, three girls, Janet, Shawna and Julie. There are other classmates with me, but I\\u2019m not sure which ones. They\\u2019re all getting ready for a party and I\\u2019m trying to get ready with them. The house we\\u2019re in is dark. There was a felt sense of unease. My brother shows up, too. We are fighting and arguing. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re fighting about, but there\\u2019s definitely discord. All I can remember of this part of the dream is that I\\u2019m trying to get ready. They\\u2019re all ready to go and are leaving. I\\u2019m trying to find shoes to put on. I\\u2019m trying to find an entire outfit - I don\\u2019t know what to wear and don\\u2019t have anything that feels good. Part of it is my resistance to going to this party. It\\u2019s making it hard for me to decide on an outfit and shoes. A coworker of mine is here, too - he\\u2019s my date to this party. Of all the other characters, he\\u2019s the only one I feel comfortable with. He\\u2019s encouraging me in a sweet way to get dressed and get in the car with him. I do. There\\u2019s a party of the dream where I\\u2019m in the car with him and we are going somewhere. That feels nice and my body feels calm in that place. But there\\u2019s so much agitation beforehand when I\\u2019m trying to get dressed, and there is bickering between me and my friends and me and my brother. My coworker is trying to smooth everything out, help me get ready and take me to the party. I go from being in the house in the living room area with friends to being in his Jeep or truck. I have feelings of gratitude and safety while I'm in the car with him. Then the scene changes. I am outdoors near the ocean. There\\u2019s a covered pavilion area and a bunch of people dancing hula. It\\u2019s so lovely to watch them dancing. It\\u2019s a bunch of different haul halaus dancing, so they each have their own style and their own songs. It\\u2019s not super formal because there isn\\u2019t a stage. I\\u2019m standing watching them to my right and behind me. They have their leis and everything. The musicians are somewhere and I can hear them playing the music, but I can\\u2019t see them. Then my hula sister Deborah shows up with her dad and her mom and my hula brother, Uncle Kam who is also my alaka\\u2019i (leader) in the hula halau. We all look at each other and wonder why we aren\\u2019t dancing because we know how to dance and we have dances to share. So, we try to put on our music. Deborah\\u2019s dad starts to play - he\\u2019s our musician - but it\\u2019s so quiet that it\\u2019s hard to hear him over the crowd noise of all the other dancers. There\\u2019s this feeling of being misfits and not allowed or accepted. We are all trying to dance, but since we can\\u2019t hear the music, our movements are all a little bit off. The other dancers are looking at us like, \\u201cWhat are you guys doing? You\\u2019re not good.\\u201d But we are just unable to hear the music fully. That part of the dream fades away. The last thing I remember before waking is a voice saying it\\u2019s time for me to be soft and release all the tension in my body. Let go of the way things were and the way you knew how to do them. Be soft.\"],[\"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people, but don\\u2019t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We\\u2019re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re heading, except that we\\u2019re trying to get out of where we are. It\\u2019s dark. If there is any lightning, it\\u2019s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we\\u2019re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don\\u2019t even know what they all do. We\\u2019re on the move. We\\u2019re all kind of dirty and grungy. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There\\u2019s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I\\u2019ve been practicing pole moves that she\\u2019s given me at home, but something happens and I\\u2019m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I\\u2019m watching. She\\u2019s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can\\u2019t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you\\u2019re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I\\u2019m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They\\u2019re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven\\u2019t touched a pole in weeks and don\\u2019t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it\\u2019s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It\\u2019s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I\\u2019m holding onto the handle to push out. I\\u2019m super disappointed because it\\u2019s so hard for me to do these moves because I\\u2019ve taken so much time off. I don\\u2019t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven\\u2019t been able to do what I\\u2019d like to do. I keep thinking I\\u2019m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I\\u2019ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back. That always bugs me.\"],[\"The first part of this dream is definitely collective-related. I\\u2019m in a car. There\\u2019s a car in front of me that I can see, it\\u2019s a Subaru. We are driving through snow. The snow is as tall as the car. I can see the car in front of us is having to make its own path through the snow. It\\u2019s interesting it\\u2019s making it because the snow is literally up to the top of the car. We are on our way to a shelter. We\\u2019re on an adventure. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who I\\u2019m with. We\\u2019re heading towards a hotel - it reminds me of an ice hotel in northern Europe. We make it there. There are multiple rooms, but it doesn\\u2019t actually look like a hotel. It looks like a huge cave and within the cave are rooms you can claim as yours. There were at least two people in the car in front of me and there are people in the car with me - I don\\u2019t know who or how many. We head into the hotel and get our rooms. The rooms are packed snow - the bed is snow shaped into a bed as you would shape a snowman. When you go out of the room and down the hall, there\\u2019s a huge crack in the ceiling where you can see blue sky. But when you look up, you can also see a cliff face that looks like the side of a mountain. The back part of the hotel is this huge cliff face. Something happens and I don\\u2019t know if somebody yells or a gunshot goes off or what, but there\\u2019s a moment with a really loud noise. As soon as that happens, I say, \\u201cOh fuck!\\u201d I know that whatever that was, it\\u2019s a moment in a time when something acts as a catalyst and as soon as it happens, I can see an avalanche at the top of the cliff. The snow just starts coming down. There\\u2019s no fucking way any of us are getting out of the path. This hotel is full of people, including kids. I just know that we are all going to be buried by this avalanche. I had this hope in my heart that it stops or goes around us or somehow we get out in time. Now I\\u2019m booking it out the other way as fast as I can to get away from this avalanche. If I can just get in the car and get out and drive away as fast as I can get out. Then the dream shifts from this place to a gym facility with multiple rooms for exercise, but also big pools. I\\u2019m with my daughter and she\\u2019s little, maybe 4, 5 or 6. There are also a lot of other young girls, teenagers. They\\u2019re on a team of some sort visiting the pool together. My daughter and I are in the locker room. We head out to the pool area. I have my wallet and phone on me. My wallet is one I had when I was a teenager - a black leather Volcrum brand. It was a men\\u2019s wallet, but I liked it because it fit into the grunge aesthetic. I put the wallet down with the phone on top, and my keys, too. It\\u2019s just this random bench on the side of the pool. There\\u2019s a huge slide, at least 10 or 12 stories high and you have to climb up stairs to get there. My daughter is running ahead of me and I\\u2019m chasing her. I don\\u2019t want her to go down this slide - it\\u2019s too tall and too dangerous. But as I am going up these steps, I can feel my heart is fucking racing. I\\u2019m looking down and I can see the surrounding city. There\\u2019s smog and the buildings are tiny. We\\u2019re up so high. I\\u2019m starting to panic. We never get to the top of the slide because all of a sudden, the stairs start to go down. My daughter is going down and I\\u2019m feeling relieved that she\\u2019s going down the stairs. I\\u2019m coming down the stairs and am like, \\u201cOh sweet baby Jesus, thank you!\\u201d I do not like heights. There are all these landings, at about every ten stairs. My mom is at one of the landings and she has a bowl of rice and poke. I\\u2019m starving and freaked out from being so high. I\\u2019ve also been worried about my daughter, who I can see has now made it all the way back down the stairs and is running around at the edge of the pool below me. I\\u2019m thinking that she\\u2019s safer down there and it\\u2019s okay. I can still see my wallet, keys and phone. I don\\u2019t know why anyone isn\\u2019t stealing them because they\\u2019re just sitting by themselves on this bench. And my daughter is also down there and she\\u2019s okay. There are some other people on this landing with me and my mom. It\\u2019s like my mom has come to me and the other people are my people - they are strangers, but I don\\u2019t feel threatened by them. But with my mom, I\\u2019m feeling a bit edgy. So she has this bowl of rice and poke and she sets it down. It\\u2019s the most perfectly made. There\\u2019s also seared ahi and just barely seared steak in this bowl, too. She sets it down between us and I go to eat some of it, but I knock it over. A bunch of it falls onto the stairs. These stairs are metal. I just pick it up and put it back in the bowl because I\\u2019m not going to waste it. I know there have been tons of people with their bare feet and chlorine and pool water coming up these stairs, but i just put it all back in the bowl because I\\u2019m going to eat it anyway. It\\u2019s like an offering she\\u2019s made towards me and I\\u2019m hungry enough I\\u2019m going to eat and I\\u2019m freaked out enough that I need something to really ground me and bring me back into my body and shift out of this panic state. This panic state went through both of these dreams. The dream shifts. Now I\\u2019m watching a tictoc video of a young local Hawaiian woman. She has her hair in a bun. She\\u2019s hanging out with her friends. She does a forward roll and the bun comes undone, so as it loosens the bun gets bigger. As her bun comes undone, her friends are teasing her saying, \\u201cOh it looks so funny!\\u201d She\\u2019s like \\u201cOh no!\\u201d and tightens the bun back up on her head. There was almost a bit of shame with her hair coming undone because her hair needing to stay up. They were poking fun at her but it wasn\\u2019t shaming and humiliating fun. But she was concerned about her hair coming out of this bun. This was a video that I was watching.\"],[\"I am in a house. I don\\u2019t recognize the house. My mother is there. She\\u2019s kind, which is strange because she\\u2019s not usually. We are washing dishes together at the sink. The sink has a bunch of windows that we\\u2019re looking out of and there are a bunch of indoor plants hanging. The plants are beautiful. One of them is totally cool and looks like green pearls that hang down. There are other leafy ones. That setting is quite beautiful. The energy and vibration coming from the plants is amazing and healing. But I don\\u2019t feel very comfortable talking to my mom - I feel like she wants something from me and I\\u2019m not wanting to give it to her. She wants kindness from me, I think. I do not want to give her any compassion and kindness. I\\u2019m faking it though and going through the motions. There\\u2019s another piece of the dream where I am holding my son as a toddler, he\\u2019s maybe 2 or 3. I\\u2019m just loving on him and he seems pretty content. I put him down to play. We\\u2019re hanging out next to each other and both of us are doing the parallel play that toddlers do. Then all of a sudden, in my mind, I go, \\u201cOh my god, I\\u2019m an adult and yes, he\\u2019s content and happy where he is right there, but actually we need human connection.\\u201d I pick him up and his demeanor changes from very content and quiet toddler play to this absolute snuggly. His little body clings to me and he\\u2019s so much happier when I pick him up, love on him and include him instead of putting him down so he does his thing and I do my thing. It just dawns on me that I need to be holding him and carrying him. The connection between the two of us enlivens and blossoms and blooms. It\\u2019s so much better and deeper the second I pick him up and look at him in his face and eyes and he looks back at me. We\\u2019re connected and touching and present, really present with each other.\"],[\"I am with my lover - it\\u2019s not anyone I recognize from real life. He has tan skin and these piercing blue eyes. He\\u2019s not 100% white, he\\u2019s definitely a person of color. I\\u2019m in his bedroom. I\\u2019m naked. He\\u2019s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I\\u2019m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s mine, but I\\u2019m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It\\u2019s weird and doesn\\u2019t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It\\u2019s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It\\u2019s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I\\u2019m on my back. I can see my lover and he\\u2019s over me. He has a fork. He\\u2019s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?\\u201d This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s what I want, let\\u2019s go for that.\\u201d Then I do this weird thing while I\\u2019m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they\\u2019re scratching my skin with the fork. It\\u2019s like some very strange BDSM play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, this is what I want. Go for it. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But the lucid part of me is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?\\u201d I\\u2019m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I\\u2019m not enjoying at all. I\\u2019m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, \\u201cHere let me show you how to use your power now.\\u201d It\\u2019s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn\\u2019t. They say, \\u201cYeah okay, show us how.\\u201d They are truly wanting to learn. Somehow I have this queen-like presence, even though part of me sees this is not it. Then they are paid and they leave. Other people are showing up at the house, like we\\u2019re having a party. There are younger women - girls, maybe early 20s - who have shown up. I\\u2019m out on the back deck adjacent to the bedroom I was just in. The bedroom was huge with white gauzy curtains and the fancy netting over the bed. All the sheets and linens and carpet were white - everything was white in this room. I go out to the deck and some of these girls from the party show up. I\\u2019m switching out the rugs that were on the deck and right at the door to wipe your feet on. I\\u2019m showing these women how to pick the correct one that goes with the decor for this party.\"],[\"A lot of different parts to this dream. I\\u2019m with a friend, Vanessa, she was another white girl who would hang out with my hula halau. She wouldn't actually dance, but she lived across the street from my kumu\\u2019s house and she would watch the kids. She was a super humble woman and also a lesbian. She\\u2019s making dinner for us - she was very much a caretaker. She\\u2019s making a meal. I\\u2019m excited for it. But I taste it and it doesn\\u2019t taste good - something feels a little bit off about it. Somehow my friends from where I live now, Austin and Aila - they own a cattle ranch - are in the dream, too. There is food that Austin is contributing because they raise cattle for eating. There\\u2019s a table where Vanessa is making the food and white walls everywhere else. When Aila and Austin show up, we are in her house, which is gorgeous. It\\u2019s a two-story house with windows that go from the floor to the second story on one side. Her kitchen is big and beautiful. She\\u2019s upset about something. She leaves. Austin starts to tell us that she\\u2019s trying to kill herself - she\\u2019s been eating poison. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on. Why is she doing that? I keep asking him if I can go see her or find her. He says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t even find her.\\u201d He also says, \\u201cNo, leave her be. She wants to be alone.\\u201d I\\u2019m really worried about this. He says, \\u201cCome with me.\\u201d I go with him. Now there are other people around and I\\u2019m not quite sure who they are - it might be my siblings or other people we both know. He says, \\u201cWe have a job to do, so let\\u2019s give Aila her space. Let\\u2019s go do our job.\\u201d We go to a Home Depot or Lowe\\u2019s type of place with hardware and all the stuff you\\u2019d find at those kinds of places, as well as their garden center. He says, \\u201cEverybody grab a plant.\\u201d We all have to bring a plant with us. I have a plant in my hand and am feeling good about having this plant - a green lush hanging plant. Whoever else I\\u2019m with is young because it feels like Austin is directing us all. He\\u2019s in charge of directing us and giving us a task. So now all of us have plants. We\\u2019re filing through the checkout line with our plants. Then, Austin and the others start to recede. Even the hardware store starts to recede. What comes forward is what seems to be Lahaina in Maui. But it does not actually look like Lahaina, at least not the Lahaina I remember. I\\u2019m there and I\\u2019m on the street. My plant is gone now. I think I\\u2019m with one of my brothers. We are walking through the streets. I have this feeling of homesickness and longing. Even though the streets don\\u2019t look like Lahaina, the palm trees are there, the tall papaya trees the banyan, and the monkeypod trees are there. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood and walking down these streets with houses on them. At one point, there\\u2019s a really big hill that I need to walk up. Through all of this, my brother is with me. Then he disappears. I\\u2019m now wandering through a part of Lahaina that feels barren or industrial - it doesn\\u2019t feel beautiful like Hawaii is. My mom and dad show up and say, \\u201cHere, come with us. We\\u2019re going this direction.\\u201d They\\u2019re young - they don\\u2019t look like who I grew up with, but like who they looked like before kids. So I follow them to the end of the road. They get in this line. There\\u2019s a crowd of people and a house. The house is freaking beautiful. Suddenly, the Ko\\u2019olaus are there. At the end of this road, we\\u2019ve passed through this weird area that doesn\\u2019t look like Hawaii and now we\\u2019re at this house that does look like Hawaii. There\\u2019s an avocado tree growing in the yard. The backdrop is all these green luscious Ko\\u2019olau mountains. There\\u2019s a crowd of people all there to see the wizard that lives at this house at the end of the road where everything is lush and green. He has some answers for everybody. My parents say, \\u201cYou have to be very respectful. You may not be invited in. He may not talk with you.\\u201d Then I see the wizard come out of his house. He wanders up the side of his lawn. There is a thick grey wall between the neighborhoods and the magical place of green and avocado trees and lusciousness. I\\u2019m on the side of the wall that is the neighborhood side. The wizard invites two people in at a time to talk with him. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to go into my house this time. You can ask me questions out here in my yard.\\u201d His yard is the base of the Ko\\u2019olaus so it goes up really steeply. I\\u2019m watching from the side of the wall as all these people go and ask their questions of him. My parents turn. I have an old point and shoot camera, and this other woman grabs the camera out of my hand. I\\u2019m trying to take pictures of the green mountains - not of the wizard and my parents. The beauty is so breathtaking that I want to take a picture of it. But this woman comes up. She is a tourist with an accent, not from the US. She grabs my little grey camera and she goes to advance the film - the way you do by pulling back on the lever. But instead of doing that, she starts winding the film up, the way you do when you finish a roll. I can hear her breaking the camera as she does that. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not how you do it. You\\u2019re not actually being helpful.\\u201d But she thinks she\\u2019s being so helpful. I\\u2019m looking at the camera and thinking if I try to advance it just once it will be okay. I try and it doesn\\u2019t work. I can see where it is and open it up, but I know if I do, I will ruin the film. I do open it up and see that sure enough the film on the inside is broken. So there\\u2019s no camera, no pictures. This woman was in line behind my parents who had been talking with the wizard this whole time. I go around the wall and sneak up and sit down to hear what he has to say. There is a sense that he will teach me and share with me what he knows. My parents didn\\u2019t think it was time for me to learn from him because I\\u2019m a kid to them, but I know I\\u2019m me and I can definitely learn all the things that need to be learned about magic from a wizard. He agrees to start teaching me. I sit down with him in his yard at the base of these mountains. There\\u2019s one other piece of the dream where I\\u2019m the observer. It\\u2019s a young couple - teenage kids. They\\u2019ve run off together. They\\u2019ve run away from their families so they can be together even if it\\u2019s just at the beach, which is where I\\u2019m seeing them. She\\u2019s definitely the one who is more riled up and instigating and pushing it. He has fear of his parents and retaliation, but he really loves her and wants to be with her. So the two of them are just hanging out for now. I see him sitting at a dock and she says, \\u201cHey, we\\u2019ve gotta go do these things. We have to get away from our family, society and culture that say we can't be together.\\u201d The boy is a Latino boy. The girl is white. At one point she drops herself into the ocean off the edge of this dock. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh gross, the water is not clean. There is too much pollution. This sandy beach you were sitting on is covered in micro-litter. It\\u2019s just not clean.\\u201d The boy is saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not clean. Don\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we only live once. We have to do these things. Come into the water. Play with me.\\u201d\"],[\"There\\u2019s a talk show happening. I\\u2019m watching it but also engaging in it and participating. I\\u2019m on the set. I\\u2019m there in real time. It\\u2019s a bunch of young teenage girls. They\\u2019re all wearing some version of a blue knit sweater. They are all from the same school so this is a uniform but they\\u2019ve each made it their own. They\\u2019re European or Swedish by nationality, but ethnicity ranges with Asian girls and black girls. They\\u2019re all female-bodied and from this one school. They\\u2019re sitting in rows in desks and I\\u2019m facing them, looking at them. There\\u2019s a big green screen behind them. To their right is a male teacher/interviewer. He is asking them these trivia quotations and they\\u2019re answering. But he\\u2019s a little bit off. Every once in a while he says something that\\u2019s super off-color or super sexist or just super objectifying. At one point I hear him saying, \\u201cAnd don\\u2019t they all have glorious tits?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck did he just say?\\u201d He says that kind of stuff, but the girls, instead of taking offence, they just own it and make it their own - not in the giggling way and giving away of power, but in a \\u201coh so you noticed, idiot, good.\\u201d It\\u2019s a very interesting dynamic. But they\\u2019re still young. I can feel they\\u2019re young and they don\\u2019t know everything because they haven\\u2019t experienced everything. It\\u2019s just so strange. This is all being televised and people are watching. At some point, my focus shifts from these young ladies to the show host. He kind of beckons me over. He wants me to look at the green screen. So I get close to him and say, \\u201cOkay, what do you want?\\u201d He says, \\u201cLook really carefully at this screen.\\u201d On the green screen is a map of the world. He says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re only showing you part of it.\\u201d As he says that, suddenly all these spots on the green screen that are showing the globe burst into flames - not physical flames, but a simulation of flames that are all over the world. He says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re not showing you everything. The world is on fire in so many more ways and places than you think.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god!\\u201d kind of like conspiracy theory style, but also not - just the plain facts that there is so much more burning than we think. In part of the show he was asking these young ladies, \\u201cWhat do you think of environmentalism? What do you think about racism?\\u201d As in what are your solutions? What can we do about it? It\\u2019s been a very interesting dynamic where with his questions he is teasing out their knowledge and their wisdom, but also saying really fucked up things and showing how this world is on fire in ways that we don\\u2019t know and places that we don\\u2019t know. Be aware that there\\u2019s so much more going on. Then the dream shifts to the shores of a beach - it\\u2019s super rugged and rocky, but not too windy. The sun is out. There\\u2019s a breeze. My son is with me. We\\u2019re going to a picnic or barbecue with people. There are all kinds of people. My son is at my shoulder and his presence stays with me, but he wanders off to go play and have fun. I\\u2019m watching these men. Some are black and some I don\\u2019t know their color. They\\u2019re tossing a football and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI want to play.\\u201d They throw me the football and I\\u2019m throwing it with a really good spiral. The thought crosses my mind: \\u201cWow, there\\u2019s a lot of sun. I\\u2019m glad I have sunscreen on my face and my hair.\\u201d But then I look down and I\\u2019m wearing one of these tops from when I was a kid. It\\u2019s an 80\\u2019s crop top with elastic on the bottom and top and you can pull it down off the shoulders and there\\u2019s a ruffle, so the ruffle is on the top and you pull it down over your shoulders. It\\u2019s a gross, not attractive cream color. It has way too much yellow in it. It\\u2019s not a good color on me. I look down and all of that skin that is exposed - over the shoulders and top of the chest - is burnt.The rest of me had sunscreen on, but that is burnt. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god!\\u201d and realize that I need to get into the shade. It\\u2019s interesting, this scene begins with a rugged beach and coastline, but there\\u2019s grass where I\\u2019m throwing the football, and past that are trees - a forest of oak trees, really gentle. I give up playing football because I realize how burnt I am. I\\u2019m walking toward the trees because I want to get into the shade. I pass two black women sitting on the grassy part. They are having their lunch and talking. I notice how they have their eyes on me as I\\u2019m walking past. They were relaxed and laughing and enjoying each other, but as soon as I get close, their entire demeanor and bodies change to this wariness like, \\u201cOh god, what is this white girl going to say? What is she going to do?\\u201d It breaks my heart because I see them disappear and I see them tracking me to make sure I\\u2019m not going to do anything. I try to make a joke how I managed to burn the fuck out of my skin. They do the polite laugh, but there\\u2019s not real connection. It\\u2019s fucking heartbreaking because I want that real connection. So I continue on to get out of their space and head to the trees, so I can take care of my burn. Then I get into the trees and the scene changes again. Now I see a walkin to a freezer and a supply closet where there are tasks to do. There\\u2019s a crew of us. We\\u2019re in some sort of building - maybe a grocery store. There\\u2019s a really low ceiling and I\\u2019m feeling quite claustrophobic. There is a manager and I don\\u2019t know them in real life. The manager is handing out tasks for everyone to do. A lot of the people have been given tasks where they have to leave this small space then come back. But I am not. The task they give me makes me stay in this small space where I feel so claustrophobic and cold. I\\u2019m going in and out of this walkin freezer and this space that feels like a supply closet. It\\u2019s so crowded and there\\u2019s not a lot of room. I\\u2019m looking at the manager like, \\u201cCan I get a different job? This is so tedious and so claustrophobic.\\u201d The manager is like, \\u201cNope, this is the one you have.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, but I could do a job where I can be outside and move my body. I\\u2019m just stuck in this spot doing this very tedious, repetitive task.\\u201d I think the task is cleaning the shelves or something. I am like, \\u201cThis is not going to last long.\\u201d No, just no. I\\u2019m feeling boxed in and just doing something that does not use my skills to the best of my ability, but the manager is stubborn about me doing it. It\\u2019s frustrating.\"],[\"This dream starts with Dana and I. We\\u2019re together and learning about anti-racism. We\\u2019re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We\\u2019re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He\\u2019s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we\\u2019re all watching. I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I\\u2019m feeling unsure and I don't know what we\\u2019re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don\\u2019t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I\\u2019m white. So I\\u2019m nervous. We\\u2019re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, \\u201cWhat do I do with Majesty?! I\\u2019m not nursing and I can\\u2019t feed him!\\u201d I have this feeling that I can\\u2019t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I\\u2019m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We\\u2019re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, you just dropped the baby!\\u201d I go to pick up the baby and Majesty\\u2019s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no!\\u201d I\\u2019m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?\\u201d Then I realize Majesty\\u2019s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he\\u2019s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he\\u2019s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphitheatre. I\\u2019m going to watch a performance. Everybody in the crowd is dressed to the nines like they\\u2019re going to see an opera. In the front row I see Nani, Janet and Shawna who are my three friends from high school that I used to hang out with. I see them and am pretending not to see them because I don't want to talk to them. But they see me and I see them track me. I walk past them and sit. I watch the performance (I don\\u2019t remember what it was). The performance ends and I walk out of the theatre. I\\u2019m in the lobby now and the lobby looks an awful lot like the lobby of the theatre at the high school I went to. It was called Gates Theatre because that was the last name of the people who donated enough money to build it. The three of them call my name and are like, \\u201cRose! Hi! We see you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, hi!\\u201d But I don\\u2019t want to talk. In Junior year of high school, Nani and Janet dropped me from the friend group and Shawna went with another friend group so I was left with no friends in my junior year. In my senior year, Nani moved away, but she sent me a letter apologizing for ostracizing me and leaving me out. I realize this is my hesitation. They always show up in my dreams and I'm like, Eh. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou know what, I\\u2019m great, I\\u2019m fine.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do small talk. But Nani wants a hug, so I guess I\\u2019ll hug her. Then I get away as quickly as I can. I go sit on a barstool at a tall table. My classmate Ikaika who I've known since second grade cruises by. He does this double take because I don\\u2019t look how I used to look and it\\u2019s not just age - I\\u2019ve had a nose job since my brother broke my nose and I just look different than I did in high school. He\\u2019s trying to figure out who it is. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey Ikaika, it\\u2019s Rose.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d He\\u2019s doing the double take thing and side eye thing that men do when they see an attractive woman. He's like, \\u201cYou are so beautiful. You are gorgeous.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup!\\u201d I hug him hello and we do some small talk and then he goes on his way. Then the dream comes back around to King Noire and anti-racism and sex work. Now I\\u2019m in a car with King. It\\u2019s a Cadillac and the top is down. We\\u2019re driving through a city and through some shady neighborhoods. I\\u2019m taking everything in. My jaw is dropped. He\\u2019s talking to me about sex, anti-racism and social justice. I can\\u2019t recall his exact words. He\\u2019s teaching and I\\u2019m listening. We end up near a river. There\\u2019s a shell floaty - like Aphrodite. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, now here\\u2019s the part of your education aroudn sex.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d Oh, I\\u2019ve been eating blueberries and they\\u2019re so sweet - they\\u2019re the most magical delicious blueberries that have ever existed. I climb on the shell and I have the blueberries. I\\u2019m wearing a skirt. King offers me the rest of the blueberries: \\u201cTake as many as you want because these are the last of them. So I put the blueberries in my lap right over my pussy. I\\u2019m eating them and am reclined back in this shell that is now floating down the river. King is like, \\u201cNow it\\u2019s time for your sex education.\\u201d There are so many feelings and thoughts and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what to do!\\u201d He leans over me and starts to eat the blueberries out of my lap where I have them nestled in my skirt. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh hell yes!\\u201d When I look up, I realize he\\u2019s completely naked and he\\u2019s leaning over me from the top. So it\\u2019s like yes, his penis is right in my face. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! I know what to do with this!\\u201d From that point forward, all of my \\u201coh my god I don't know what\\u2019s happening\\u201d thoughts change to \\u201coh I don\\u2019t need to be an expert, I know what to do with what's in front of me.\\u201d There\\u2019s this beautiful dick hanging in front of my mouth and I am definitely going to suck on that. It\\u2019s a knowing. This part ends with us 69\\u2019ing in a shell floating down a river in a city by some shady neighborhoods. It\\u2019s not a problem! I realize I was just getting in my own way of things I was trying to learn. The whole time King was being very stern and very king-like. There\\u2019s a recognition of King and his wife - they are so centered, they know who they are, they know what they\\u2019re doing here, they know their worth, they don't fucking question it, they just are king and queen. The whole time I didn\\u2019t know if I was worthy. But by the end of the dream, I knew what to do and realized this is very human. What else would you do if I had a lapful of blueberries?!\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to see my lover. He\\u2019s working out in the forest. There\\u2019s a complex of a bunch of buildings where he\\u2019s working with a bunch of his buddies. One building is a dorm. There\\u2019s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I\\u2019m out there and thinking I\\u2019ll do this work with him. He\\u2019s really not happy to see me. He\\u2019s really pissed off that I\\u2019m in his space. I\\u2019m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there\\u2019s a whole sheet of them, so there\\u2019s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I\\u2019ve collected it and I\\u2019m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There\\u2019s a presence of my son, but he\\u2019s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don\\u2019t come out here.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019m actually here to do work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t lie to me. I know you\\u2019re here to see me.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling hurt and confused. I\\u2019m not really sure why I\\u2019m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he\\u2019s not happy about it. I\\u2019m not happy about it now either, because he\\u2019s being a bit of a dick. He\\u2019s asking me all kinds of questions like, \\u201cWhat are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?\\u201d He\\u2019s asking all these questions that I don\\u2019t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn\\u2019t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can\\u2019t remember. In the last scene, I\\u2019m with a client of mine who is getting married. It\\u2019s the day of the wedding and I\\u2019m there as an officiant. I\\u2019m also there to set up the wedding. It\\u2019s the second time she\\u2019s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting read are not there. I\\u2019m trying to make these burlap pumpkins as part of the decor. I\\u2019m just making do with what I\\u2019ve got because I can\\u2019t find some of the supplies I used last time when I was getting everything ready for the wedding, but it didn\\u2019t happen. This time I\\u2019m trying to do my best with what I\\u2019ve got. My client is really excited. She\\u2019s trying on her wedding dress. She\\u2019s showing it to me. We\\u2019re in this room that\\u2019s part of a bigger hall where she\\u2019s getting married. Her bridesmaids are there and there are other people. It\\u2019s going to work even though it got canceled once and we don\\u2019t have all the supplies we had last night. We\\u2019re still making the wedding work and she still looks beautiful. There\\u2019s joy in this part of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve come in off the streets - it\\u2019s a neighborhood, city-like feel with lots of people. It\\u2019s dark, not quite night. I go into a shop where I work. We sell lights - beautifully made unique chandeliers and light fixtures. There is also art on the wall. I work for an older woman in her fifties or early sixties. One of my duties is to clean up. The shop looks kind of dusty and the lights haven\\u2019t been cleaned in a while. There\\u2019s a lot of clutter everywhere on the counters and whatnot. Some of the clutter is mine that I\\u2019ve just left around. There\\u2019s a pair of jeans and a wet towel on the countertop. It\\u2019s just really messy. The relationship I have with this lady is familiar but not healthy. This asian man walks in and wants to buy a chandelier. He picks out one that has panes of green glass - the glass is cut into rectangles and squares. The woman is selling it specifically to him - it\\u2019s not like he has just wandered in. He has to decorate his elderly parents\\u2019 flat. He needs lights no matter what and is very consciously picking out the lights with the green tones. He thinks that his parents will like it. To him, it also has significance around healing and keeping them healthy. The owner of the shop is wrapping it up for him. I was in the back cleaning up the towel and that weird pair of jeans. There\\u2019s another chandelier that I was looking at earlier and showing the shop owner. It\\u2019s a longer chandelier - maybe five feet long - with thick brass or gold round tubes that hang down from the top where the light is. It also has a cascade of glass panels like the other one, but the panels are not blue and green, they are the colors of a pastel rainbow. I say something like, \\u201cThis is our unicorn chandelier.\\u201d I put it down while I was cleaning. It needed to be cleaned and it was definitely one of our more expensive pieces. While this asian man is being run up by the shop owner, I give him a tour of some of the other chandeliers. I get this hit that he needs another light. I show him this one chandelier and he\\u2019s gobsmacked in total awe. He doesn\\u2019t even ask the price. He doesn\\u2019t need me to tell him about it. He just knows that it\\u2019s his. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. This is a beautiful piece of art and the healing properties within this one are even more than the one you\\u2019re buying.\\u201d So he takes it to the front to be run up as well. In the meantime, I\\u2019ve cleared out all of the junk from the shop, including all these wet towels that were on the countertops. If you look at the countertops, you can see the outline where the wet towels were. But now they\\u2019re gone. The chandeliers and art are no longer dusty. The dream ends with him taking the chandeliers, very pleased knowing that he\\u2019s going to put this light in his parents\\u2019 flat and they\\u2019re going to be so grateful. It feels like the relationship between me and the shop owner has improved now that things are cleaned and I upsold the chandelier to the Asian man. Suddenly we have an easier connection.\"],[\"At one point I\\u2019m face to face in a conversation with my friend Shawna from high school. She has a fork in her hand and is running it down my skin or is poking my arm with it. She says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re in a major metamorphosis.\\u201d I immediately think of a butterfly when she says this.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been in school learning. I just have a vague impression of being in school. Right now I\\u2019m out. I\\u2019m either looking for food and have bought food from what used to be a McDonald\\u2019s, but things still look weird post-quarantine and there\\u2019s only limited availability. The golden arches sign is no longer available to be used. I\\u2019ve bought boxed cereal and some other items, but they\\u2019re stale. I\\u2019m going back to return them. I\\u2019ve gone inside the building. I have these two big grocery bags with the cereal and other stuff. I go back to the counter and tell the woman who\\u2019s working behind the counter in her viser and McDonald\\u2019s uniform that I\\u2019m returning these. The whole time I\\u2019m thinking that you can\\u2019t return cereal to McDonald\\u2019s, they don\\u2019t do returns. But she takes the cereal and whatever else I have in the bag. I\\u2019m really relieved. It was a big pain in the ass and burden to have all this cereal and other stuff that was stale and I couldn\\u2019t eat and spent money. I was relieved to get my money back, but also surprised. The scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a gigantic empty warehouse. A wedding or birthday is happening - something is being celebrated. But again, things are kind of strange because the crowd is sparse. There is a pastor or somebody doing the marrying or celebrating...or maybe someone has graduated? My friend from high school, Teresa, is there. She\\u2019s all by herself. I see her but she doesn\\u2019t see me yet. It\\u2019s been years and years since we\\u2019ve seen each other and I\\u2019m really excited. But for the moment our focus is on what\\u2019s happening in this party thing. The ceremony concludes and there\\u2019s a handful of other people - some men - one of which I think is her husband and the husband\\u2019s side of the family. I\\u2019m watching because it seems odd that she\\u2019s not hanging out with or sitting next to him. She\\u2019s off by herself. So I go to talk to her and say hello because I haven\\u2019t seen her in forever. She\\u2019s happy to see me and I'm happy to see her. We talk a little about the ceremony that just happened. There\\u2019s some sort of triage that has to happen. Someone is sick or ill and needs some help. I watch her as she helps this person. We\\u2019re still catching up. Then she finishes what she's doing and I ask her: \\u201cSo how is your husband? How is your married life?\\u201d She gives me this look. I look at her fingers to see if she has a wedding ring on. She has multiple rings on. I think one of them is a wedding ring. But she gives me this look and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been the most painful thing I\\u2019ve ever experienced.\\u201d I'm not sure if she\\u2019s still married or not. She says, \\u201cHe cheated on me.\\u201d I can see on her face that she still has pain around being cheated on. I still cannot tell if they\\u2019re still together or not by the way she\\u2019s talking. She is relaying to me the absolute pain she has experienced in finding out her husband cheated on her. I\\u2019m looking at her and am like, \\u201cWell, my husband didn\\u2019t cheat on me, but I\\u2019m no longer married and I\\u2019m in a situation where things are kind of hairy and frustrating and it doesn\\u2019t feel good.\\u201d We talk about that a little bit. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been so long and we have so much to catch up on.\\u201d As she\\u2019s telling me this, she\\u2019s talking really quickly because she has to catch a plane and leave now that the ceremony is over. Again, I\\u2019ve been looking at her fingers for a wedding ring and I\\u2019m also looking to see if she\\u2019s pregnant. I keep thinking she is pregnant, but I can\\u2019t quite tell. She tells me a little bit of her story. I realize that whatever plane she was supposed to catch, she\\u2019s probably missed it or we\\u2019re bending time because it\\u2019s taking awhile for her to tell this story. There is a sense of urgency that she has to go, though. I am feeling that I really want to hear her and witness for her. It seems important to do that. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my two kids and my ex. We are moving out of a high rise condo and back to our old house in Corvallis that has been rented for quite a bit of time. A lot has been moved around and changed in the Corvallis house. We get there and see that there\\u2019s a lot of clean up to do - a lot of stuff that needs to go to the trash. It feels weird and strange because I\\u2019m with my ex who I don\\u2019t really like and he\\u2019s been being an asshole for the last couple months. My focus and attention is on the kids. He\\u2019s sort of cleaning up. He left his computer there, which is weird. Some of the things in the house are things he actually left when we moved and somehow over the years of renting the house, those things stayed - for example his computer, computer speakers and other things. He\\u2019s gathering them all up and getting rid of them. There\\u2019s also stuff that the tenants left on top of the fridge. There\\u2019s a box of baseball gloves and underneath that is a box of mittens and stuff. I\\u2019m looking at all the curtains and see that they\\u2019re all the same curtains that had been there for years. I wonder if anybody has ever washed them. At one point, he goes outside with my son who is younger in this dream - maybe 4, 5 or 6. My ex is chopping down the fence in the backyard and there's this tree growing in the backyard which was not there originally. This is where the home deviates from the home in this reality. There\\u2019s a tree that he is chopping down as well as the fence. All of these fences are coming down. I\\u2019m glad for it because there\\u2019s more space and I like that it feels more open and spacious. But a part of me remembers when he put that fence up and now it\\u2019s interesting that he\\u2019s chopping it down. The inside of the house is getting uncluttered as I carry stuff out. Then our neighbor from across the street comes over and helps us move stuff out. One of the things she carries out is my daughter\\u2019s old desk - it\\u2019s an antique desk that we bought for her when she was little, but it\\u2019s a child\\u2019s desk and too small for her now. The neighbor moves it out and puts it on the street. I can see it through the windows of the house and it\\u2019s sitting on the corner with a free sign. The thought crosses my mind: \\u201cWe paid a lot of money for that antique desk, maybe we should sell it on Craigslist.\\u201d But I\\u2019m just happy to have it out of the house and that more space is becoming available. The last thing I notice is a bed in the middle of the living room and the sheets are the old sheets we had before we moved. I\\u2019m thinking that a lot of people have slept on these sheets and it\\u2019s gross. The sheets and curtains - all these linens - are made of this bright yellow terry cloth material with a blue lace trim along the bottom. I made those a long time ago. I\\u2019m pulling them off to wash them or throw them away because they\\u2019ve been hanging up and lying on this bed for a really long time. Even though I made them, I don\\u2019t want to keep them because I have no idea who\\u2019s been sleeping on these sheets. I toss them. That feels good. The last little bit is when my ex comes back in from chopping down the fence and trees. I had seen his computer and wanted to get on the computer to do some research. I was like, \\u201cOh, a computer. This is helpful. There\\u2019s lots of things I can do with this.\\u201d Instead of us working together to clean up, he gathers up all his stuff and is like, \\u201cThis is mine.\\u201d He leaves with it. The tone of the dream changes from cooperative to him just taking what\\u2019s his and leaving. He leaves and the kids stay with me in the house.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a grocery store and it\\u2019s very dark out. It\\u2019s not night, but there are dark clouds. Everything is dark out and even the grocery store is dark and dreary even though there are fluorescent lights. It\\u2019s pretty packed with people. I have a cart and I\\u2019m shopping for the kids. I\\u2019m doing the week\\u2019s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I\\u2019m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me. I\\u2019m walking through the aisles and my kids and are talking about what they want for dinner. Then my ex shows up and he says, \\u201cWell you can\\u2019t actually have the kids. You\\u2019re not going to get to spend a lot of time with them. You\\u2019re just shopping, then I\\u2019m going to take all of this and leave with the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m fucking pissed that he\\u2019s treating me like that and talking me like that and manipulating the kids in front of me. I can see that they\\u2019re torn because they were just having a great time with me, but when he showed up, their allegiance went straight to him. He\\u2019s saying he\\u2019s just going to take the groceries and all this because he\\u2019s paying for them. I\\u2019m so done with him and seeing the kids frustrated that I say, \\u201cNo, you do it. I\\u2019m out of here. I\\u2019m not going to participate in this.\\u201d The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very \\u201cfuck you\\u2019ish\\u201d way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It\\u2019s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I\\u2019m so mad, but I\\u2019m very clear that I\\u2019m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I\\u2019m not playing his game. I\\u2019m not doing it his way.\"],[\"It\\u2019s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I\\u2019m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It\\u2019s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it\\u2019s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I\\u2019m going in and out of groups and shops. I\\u2019m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it\\u2019s a shop or someone\\u2019s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave and walk out. I\\u2019m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I\\u2019m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I\\u2019m hovering - I\\u2019m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don\\u2019t see me. They\\u2019re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m standing there, but I\\u2019m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they\\u2019re not seeing me. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a lake or the ocean. There\\u2019s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It\\u2019s all outdoors. As I\\u2019m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I\\u2019m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I\\u2019m telling them, \\u201cYes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great\\u201d because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I\\u2019m not going to get any of them because I\\u2019m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They\\u2019ve gotten their cheese and now they\\u2019re at the wine bar ordering wine. I\\u2019m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, \\u201cWe actually have work to do.\\u201d There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There\\u2019s a hose right there. She says, \\u201cI have all these things I have to clean.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I\\u2019ll help you clean these things.\\u201d So we\\u2019re scrubbing containers and tubs. I\\u2019m doing all the scrubbing and she\\u2019s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She\\u2019s really sad. I\\u2019m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn\\u2019t doing a whole lot. She\\u2019s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I\\u2019m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I\\u2019m just doing the motions. There\\u2019s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a piece of property with two houses. There\\u2019s a main house and a secondary building that is smaller and looks like a single-wide, slanted with one side taller than the other. The taller side of this building is all sliding glass windows and you can see into it. The land has eucalyptus trees and a mango tree. It looks kind of tropical but also like California, desert with a lot of oak trees. I\\u2019m with my family - my dad, mom and siblings - and other people who I don\\u2019t recognize, but have the sense they are ancestors. It\\u2019s a gathering. The focus is on this little house with all the sliding doors and glass windows. I can see into it and there are Persian rugs all over and couches. The other house is a grand house that\\u2019s very well appointed, while this house is more humble with a small kitchen off to the left and a bath. I don\\u2019t see any beds, but my dad is telling me that he and friends have stayed there and really liked sleeping there. I can see a fireplace. But I have no idea where they sleep. I see a dining room table and chairs and a couple couches, but again, no beds. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere are you all sleeping? There are no beds and no place to sleep.\\u201d This house is definitely a focus for the moment. Parts of it need fixing up. It doesn\\u2019t have plumbing and they\\u2019re planning on putting plumbing in it. Me and my dad and at least a few other people are gathered around the house and looking at it and talking about it. Then, the scene changes. I\\u2019m with somebody who looks like a young Keanu Reeves and he\\u2019s hurt. He had some sort of accident and is learning to walk again. I\\u2019m watching him getting rehab in the pool with his mom and sister - I have no idea if he has a mom and sister in real life. I\\u2019m watching them encourage him to do his pool exercises of swimming and water jogging so that he regains the full use of his body and legs. He does. At first he starts out really bitter and sullen, but then his demeanor changes as he spends time in the pool. I\\u2019m in the pool with them and I can see him do his exercises. They\\u2019re at one end of the pool and he\\u2019s swimming back and forth to the wall. He reminds me of my brother, too - it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s switching back and forth. He regains full use of his body and gets out of the pool. Then the Rock shows up. I\\u2019m following along with all of this, but can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m actually in the dream or just observing. They climb into a helicopter. There\\u2019s one other person who shows up, but I can\\u2019t remember who it is, although it\\u2019s some movie star. They climb into the helicopter and I\\u2019m afraid that the helicopter isn\\u2019t balanced and if we all get in, it\\u2019s going to tip backwards and fall off the ledge it\\u2019s perched on. The helicopter is all black on the outside. There\\u2019s also a dog. The Rock is the pilot. Keanu Reeves is in the helicopter and ready for an action adventure mission. Then the third person has also climbed in. My fear is that they\\u2019re going to tip over backwards because the helicopter is sitting on a ledge - it\\u2019s not on a super stable helipad. I\\u2019ve followed them into the cockpit but don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m really there because I don\\u2019t have a place to sit and no one is addressing me. They\\u2019re all healthy and ready to go. I\\u2019m hearing mission kind of music playing in my head, so it\\u2019s really like a movie. They\\u2019re going to take off. I think I go with them, but I can\\u2019t remember. Below us is a bunch of water - it\\u2019s like a cliff face with rocks and ocean down below.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a shower stall with Ana. I can\\u2019t remember if our clothes are on or off. We\\u2019re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I\\u2019m looking at her like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re just kind of winging it.\\u201d I wish I could remember more, but there\\u2019s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with my siblings. We\\u2019re all in a big house together and it\\u2019s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We\\u2019re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it\\u2019s just covered in blueberries. We\\u2019re munching on them. We\\u2019re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he\\u2019s not a very smooth driver. So I\\u2019m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he\\u2019s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it\\u2019s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We\\u2019re in a house of some sort but I don\\u2019t recognize it and I don\\u2019t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we\\u2019re all gathered for a wedding. I\\u2019m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he\\u2019s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there\\u2019s no bowl and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cHey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.\\u201d The popcorn starts popping and it\\u2019s endless. I\\u2019m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it\\u2019s going everywhere. It wouldn\\u2019t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I\\u2019m looking down and thinking you can\\u2019t even save this. He\\u2019s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, \\u201cnice way to go, dad,\\u201d and I think my dad is standing there like, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s not a good way to pop popcorn.\\u201d As he\\u2019s sweeping up the popcorn, there\\u2019s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There\\u2019s tons of it and it\\u2019s all over the floor. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what you\\u2019re going to do with all of this. You\\u2019re going to have to throw it away.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make more.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.\\u201d It feels like a waste. There was more to this dream, but I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I can see a pair of motorcycles and a thing that has three wheels, like the comfy ride for old people who want to ride motorcycles, but can\\u2019t stay on two wheels. I\\u2019m observing all of this and don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m in this part of the dream. So these two women riding these motorcycles are pretty fucking badass and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re going pretty fast. There\\u2019s a dude in this three-wheeler behind them. He\\u2019s kind of reckless and pushing him from behind. They\\u2019re weaving in and out of cars and traffic. The feeling of it is really dangerous. There aren\\u2019t a lot of cars. The road itself is going through wheat fields and forest on the other side of the road. The terrain keeps changing as everyone is speeding through this. There\\u2019s also a bus behind that\\u2019s kind of following. I\\u2019m going back and forth between hovering over the motorcycles watching and being in the bus and talking to the bus driver. I\\u2019m watching these motorcycles and at one point I see the guy in the three-wheeler veer off into a wheat field and destroy a bunch of the wheat. Then he comes back onto the road and is still behind these women. The feeling of this part is really intense - the sounds of the motorcycles are really loud in my ear. The wheels of the motorcycles and the three-wheeler are cartoonishly big. There are other passengers in the bus. The inside of the bus is like a school bus, the way the seats are set up, but the outside of the bus doesn\\u2019t look like a school bus. I don\\u2019t know who the bus driver is - it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. He has a wise demeanor about him - he has the feeling of being a guide in this dream. I\\u2019m watching and then the scene cuts away into some sort of night club or bar. I\\u2019m leaning against a bar and talking to these two men whose eyes are a light piercing blue with a light behind them. There\\u2019s definitely flirting going on between us. There\\u2019s a mirror behind the bartender where all the alcohol is sitting on shelves. It\\u2019s dim inside. I know that the people on the motorcycles are safe and fine. I see that the guy that was pushing them on is back on the bus. The bus is now a lab and he\\u2019s standing in this metal cage with rings. The metal cage is very close to his body but not actually touching him. There\\u2019s one ring around his knees, another around his hips and another around his chest. His hands are tied behind him and his body is all bruised. His hair is red. His skin is pretty pale. He\\u2019s yelling as if there\\u2019s some sort of punishment happening to him in this bus that has turned into a lab. So one part of my attention is on that and another part of my attention is with these two guys. It almost feels like they\\u2019re trying to distract me from what\\u2019s happening to this other dude in the bus. I keep seeing electricity coming out from the contraption that he\\u2019s in and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s making him scream. Then just like a scene fades in a movie, the lights go down on the guy in the bus/lab. The lights were an eerie blue and then they fade away totally. I\\u2019m left in the bar and the lights have a red tinge even though they\\u2019re dim.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and my siblings are there as well as my mom and dad. My youngest brother is the one I\\u2019m interacting with. They\\u2019re young, it\\u2019s when they were babies. My ex is there, he\\u2019s somewhere in the mix. My current lover is with me, as well. We\\u2019re trying to clean the bedroom and get my younger brothers ready for school. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I\\u2019m getting frustrated trying to get them ready. My lover and I want to take a shower. We walk into the bathroom and the entire bathroom is covered in shit and grey water and toilet paper. It\\u2019s like a toilet backed up all the way to the ceiling. There are white tiles on the shower wall and the whole bathroom is white, but it\\u2019s covered in this grey old toilet paper and poop. We\\u2019re both standing there barefoot, having walked in and are like, \\u201coh my god, this is so gross,\\u201d but not having another option. We just had to clean it. We\\u2019re both naked and trying to clean it. It\\u2019s just so gross. At one point we fill the whole bathroom with water to wash it all away. Neither of us are happy about it. I have some feelings of embarrassment and I can tell my lover is annoyed, but it\\u2019s just something we have to do. So we clean it. Then we get my little brother off to a race - it\\u2019s like a go-cart race. We get him to the race in time after cleaning the disgusting bathroom. So gross.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger\\u2019s seat. We\\u2019re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I\\u2019m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex\\u2019s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It\\u2019s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she\\u2019s there, but I\\u2019m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There\\u2019s only one white man in the entire house. It\\u2019s so interesting. I\\u2019m noticing all of this. They\\u2019re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There\\u2019s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the \\u201cI feel\\u201d and \\u201cI experience\\u201d and \\u201cWhen this happened, it made me feel like this\\u201d language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It\\u2019s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, \\u201cOh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.\\u201d I start to get this nagging feeling that it\\u2019s time for us to continue on our road trip. I\\u2019ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it\\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. I\\u2019m cleaning up my space. It\\u2019s like an Airbnb, so I\\u2019m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she\\u2019s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I\\u2019m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I\\u2019m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I\\u2019m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it\\u2019s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don\\u2019t, and I change my clothes. I\\u2019m kind of damp. I don\\u2019t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren\\u2019t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.\"],[\"An Asian woman who is shorter than me and is beautiful with long hair down to her waist and a beautiful body and face doesn\\u2019t believe she is beautiful. She keeps saying she\\u2019s not beautiful. I\\u2019m watching her take off her clothes and look at herself in the mirror. As she looks at herself, her legs and hips start to get really big and swollen with fluids like elephantiasis. It\\u2019s just from the waist down. She\\u2019s just telling herself that she looks ugly. There\\u2019s a man in the room with her who keeps telling her, \\u201cNo, no, you look beautiful.\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t believe him. She can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and she can\\u2019t understand him. I\\u2019m watching this interaction and thinking in my head, \\u201cYes, he\\u2019s right. Listen to him!\\u201d But she can\\u2019t hear it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I\\u2019m in. I think I\\u2019m hanging out with family and friends. This Japanese royalty shows up with a lot of people - multiple cars full of Japanese royal family. Up until they arrived, we were all just playing and having a good time. When they arrive, it\\u2019s almost as if they\\u2019re watching us play. There are at least forty or fifty of them. They\\u2019re all sitting at these long tables. I go up to talk to them with the little bit of Japanese I know. This seems to delight everyone. This festival quality comes into the air - celebration is happening. They\\u2019re really happy to observe us having a good time. We\\u2019re going to do some dances and put on a show. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m in my play clothes and they\\u2019re dirty, so I\\u2019m going to go get dressed up for dancing on stage.\\u201d I go to get dressed up and I can\\u2019t find any clothes that I like or that fits or looks good. I find a pair of mom jeans that do not look attractive. Then I look in the mirror and am like, \\u201cWhat is wrong with my face?\\u201d My face looks really old and weird. And my hair is short. I\\u2019ve got this short mom haircut that is not attractive. The hair is dark and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh, what if dyed it?\\u201d So, I think I\\u2019ll dye it blonde. When I look in the mirror my hair is suddenly blonde with crazy root grow out.Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, that doesn\\u2019t look good. I don\\u2019t like that. What if I turn the blonde part pink and the roots turn purple?\\u201d I look in the mirror and sure enough, my hair turns that color. So my hair looks cute, but it\\u2019s kind of straw\\u2019ish - like what happens when you color your hair a lot. But when I look at myself, I think, \\u201cWow, you\\u2019re really trying whatever you can to look cute for these dances on stage, but you don\\u2019t.\\u201d I\\u2019m being pretty harsh on myself. One of my friends, an instructor friend from pole studio, runs in and says, \\u201cThere are only a couple of numbers left. We keep missing you. We\\u2019re ready for you to come dance!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, okay, I\\u2019ll be there. I just need to get some clothes on that look good.\\u201d But I never find anything that looks good. I just go out of this room and can see the stage where they\\u2019re all dancing. I can see the Japanese royalty watching. I watch them dance and miss all the dances. It makes me sad because I really want to dance, but I also feel really not myself, like this mom body, mom haircut, mom face, mom jeans. I don\\u2019t understand why suddenly \\u201cmom\\u201d is a derogatory term in my head. I guess I feel dumpy. So that happens. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a house with a different set of friends and we\\u2019re all sitting on a couch. My friend Aila is there and my other friends who I\\u2019m on council with. We\\u2019re talking about my new relationship. I\\u2019m saying what has happened and how I handled it. I\\u2019m asking if I missed anything or if I handled it in a healthy way. I\\u2019m getting feedback from them. At one point, I ask Aila, \\u201cIs this lust and infatuation and some sort of misguided spiritual projection? Or is this really love?\\u201d Aila looks at me and she says, \\u201cOh no, Rose, it\\u2019s really love.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d and I get up and grab my phone and show her a picture I have of the two of us so she can see. I had a feeling all along that it was really love, too, but there\\u2019s a part of me that is constantly second guessing. But before I can show her the picture, a friend from high school named Janet shows up. Janet is half Japanese, half German. She is like, \\u201cI\\u2019m coming to join the council! I just have these other things to do and I haven\\u2019t gotten to it yet.\\u201d We\\u2019re looking up at her and are like, \\u201cOkay, great. Get here when you get here.\\u201d It seems like a strange interruption because in real life, she\\u2019s not actually part of the council, but it doesn\\u2019t seem to matter. We\\u2019re sitting on this couch in a house and there\\u2019s stuff going on around us with people coming and going, but I don\\u2019t know who the people are or what they\\u2019re doing - it\\u2019s just noise and bodies in the background. Then Janet comes out of that noise and interrupts and disappears again.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with two guys, one of them is Josh. We\\u2019re at a zoo. We\\u2019re looking at the displays and I\\u2019m sad about animals being in the zoo. But, I don't actually see any animals. The displays are all empty. I walk into one of them and am trying to show Josh and the other guy, maybe he\\u2019s my brother, that your eyesight is limited from the point of view of the animal. I\\u2019ve walked into the display area and am looking out to where the crowds would be standing. I say, \\u201cSee you can only see so much if you\\u2019re in here.\\u201d I try to show them this. Then I turn around and it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s an inside part of these displays that opens up into a huge cylinder shaped room that opens up to the sky. Inside are more cages and laboratories and places for the animals. I want to explore this. The other two come in with me. We\\u2019re curious. We don't know exactly what is happening in this area of the zoo. I still can\\u2019t see any animals. Except, as I get closer, I\\u2019m looking at a lot of metal and cages and fluorescent lights. As I\\u2019m looking, these tiny, maybe three inches tall, koala bears show up. They\\u2019re climbing this little bird stand with the wide dish at the bottom for bird seed. There isn't a cage around it, though. The tiny koalas are hyper and all over the place. This scientist zoologist comes out with a black house cat (his familiar?) and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! I want to hold this tiny koala!\\u201d The scientist says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the tiny koala. They\\u2019re on something. I don\\u2019t know what they might do to you. They might bite you. They might scratch you. So just leave them alone.\\u201d So I just look at them. At first there was one, then there were two, then there were like fifty of them swarming this little stand. They are moving kind of crazily. I back up a little bit. We\\u2019re just poking around this inside place and looking for other animals. I get a sense that there are other things we could be doing than this. The scene changes. I don't know what happens to the other two. I\\u2019m in this outdoor area that reminds me of a college campus. There\\u2019s a football team going by. It\\u2019s Fall, leaves are falling, there are leaves on the ground and it\\u2019s kind of chilly. I\\u2019m wearing shorts and a shirt. A lot of the football players are classmates from school, but there are also a bunch of them that I don\\u2019t recognize. As the football team files past me some of them who are my old classmates say hi. They\\u2019re really excited to see me. I realize this is because I\\u2019m wearing velvet bootie shorts and a tiny little crop top. So, they seem like they\\u2019re happy to see me but I think it\\u2019s just because of what I\\u2019m wearing. Somehow I\\u2019m wearing this because it\\u2019s one of those fall days where it\\u2019s still pretty warm in the middle of the day. Apparently the temperature isn\\u2019t bothering me. I turn around and go to this larger grassy area where there are a bunch of people gathered. They\\u2019re all on their own blankets. I go to the spot with a bunch of friends. I don't recognize all the people on the blanket but I get the sense that I know them because they say, \\u201cHey Rose!\\u201d and I sit down and we\\u2019re talking. At one point, Ana shows up with her son. They are so brown - their skin is so dark and they\\u2019re totally naked! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThose two have been out in the sun all summer! I\\u2019m jealous!\\u201d They\\u2019re the only two who are naked. The rest of us have some kind of clothing on. But the thing that stands out is how tan the two of them are. Then, I leave the blanket and go into a house or something. I\\u2019m heading towards the inside and set up a lawn chair for myself. Then someone wants to talk to me and I get distracted and go elsewhere. I do the interaction but don\\u2019t remember what it is. I think it\\u2019s a football player who was one of my old classmates and wants to talk. He tries to convince me to come watch the game or go to some sort of after party. I finish that interaction and go back to sit in my chair, but someone is in my chair. This happens like three times where I go talk to someone and go back to my chair, but the chair I\\u2019ve set up for myself, someone else is in it. The first two times I get a new chair. The third time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYo, that\\u2019s my chair! Get out. I set that up for me.\\u201d The person who is in it this last time is a cranky older gentleman. He maybe needs the chair more than I do. I\\u2019m pissed off about losing my chair yet again, but thinking maybe he actually needs it. Then again, one more football player comes over and wants to talk to me. It\\u2019s like they all want to spend time with me and go on a date. They want me to come to their football games and just be around them. There\\u2019s a funny earnestness and innocence in the way they\\u2019re showing up to try and get my attention. It\\u2019s not creepy at all. They\\u2019re not trying to be players or extra smooth. They just really want me around. They want my energy around. It\\u2019s funny.\"],[\"The first part of the dream is a bunch of kids who seem young, maybe twelve or thirteen. I\\u2019m in the mix and my body might be twelve or thirteen but my brain is definitely an adult\\u2019s brain. We\\u2019re at this boarding school. There are six of us who are learning how to be astronauts. We\\u2019re wandering around and we find this office with all of the gear we would need to get on the spaceship, fly it, and head to the moon. So we\\u2019re collecting all this stuff. It\\u2019s stuff that the other astronauts who have already been to the moon have used. It\\u2019s their things. We\\u2019re collecting it because we\\u2019re going to go. I\\u2019m simultaneously one of the kids collecting the things and also the adult going, \\u201cOh gosh, these kids are going to kill themselves. It\\u2019s not safe. I need to stop them.\\u201d I\\u2019m playing both roles, which is weird. The enthusiasm of the kids is really high and cute. But it\\u2019s not feasible for them to suddenly get on a spaceship and head up to space because they\\u2019re twelve. They have all their things. I don\\u2019t know if their professors or the actual astronauts find us in their office. We snuck in. there\\u2019s a sense that we shouldn\\u2019t be there. They come in. It's two or three of the astronauts who are also teachers. They sit down and I can tell they know what we\\u2019re trying to do and there\\u2019s no way in hell it\\u2019s going to happen. But they indulge us. They are asking the kids all these questions: \\u201cHow are you going to do this, this and this? How are you going to take care of this? What food are you going to eat? The food question is funny because we\\u2019re all actually eating food and some of the kids are wanting to share the food with the astronauts. I can tell that the other kids are not aware that these teachers are the actual astronauts. They haven\\u2019t put that together yet. I\\u2019m watching all of this and also in the conversation and offering some of my food to one of the astronauts even though I know they\\u2019re going to say no. the reason they\\u2019re asking all these questions is that at some point they\\u2019re going to say we can\\u2019t do all this stuff because we\\u2019re not prepared. We are sitting around a rounded desk. This goes on for a while. The scene changes. We never get on a spaceship or anything. The teachers/astronauts never say, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re not going,\\u201d or \\u201cYou\\u2019re in trouble for breaking into the office.\\u201d I keep waiting for that to happen and it doesn\\u2019t happen. It\\u2019s like the astronauts are so bemused by the excitement and enthusiasm of the kids that they let it play out. Then I am hanging with Johnny and Amanda again - I\\u2019ve known both of them since second grade. They were married seven or eight years ago and now have a couple kids. Johnny is the leader again. He has a group of people with him. I don\\u2019t recognize all the people, but I do see Amanda there. He\\u2019s pretty upbeat and everybody is excited to be there. We are outside in my backyard somehow. At one point, I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s moving around the crowd. He comes to me and picks me up. We\\u2019re holding hands and our arms are locked. I\\u2019m using all of my muscles to stay upright. He\\u2019s moving me around like in acroyoga. I am thinking how this takes a lot of shoulder strength to hold me up like this. It takes a lot of shoulder strength on my end to hold myself up like this, too! Everybody is having a good time. Then suddenly it\\u2019s time to go. It\\u2019s time to move on. It\\u2019s time for Johnny to move his group of people and I\\u2019m with them. Now I have a pair of roller skates on. There are a couple other other moms in this group as well, and they also have roller skates on. There are younger kids with roller skates on. There are moms wearing their kids. I think Amanda is wearing a baby. I watch them go. I think I should also grab my tennis shoes in case we have to go uphill or we have to go inside where roller skates are not a good idea. So I\\u2019m watching them go and decide to go with them first because I want to see where they go. I forget to get my shoes. I can feel how fast I\\u2019m gliding in these roller skates and it\\u2019s a lot of fun. There are other moms in this group. I\\u2019m at the back of the crowd. We are skating down streets but the streets are cracked and there\\u2019s grass growing up out of the streets. So it\\u2019s not super smooth. I realize I really do need to get my shoes. The group is going really slow so I do have time to skate back to my place and grab my shoes. Wherever we\\u2019re going, we are leaving these places for good. We aren\\u2019t coming back. I leave the group and it kind of feels a little bit painful but I know I\\u2019ll be able to find them because I\\u2019m on roller skates and I\\u2019m going faster than they are. I know I\\u2019ll be able to hear them. So I roller skate back to my house up this hill. I\\u2019m going really fast. I grab my tennis shoes and put them in this backpack. Instead of going the way I came with the group, I cut across all of these streets. The streets remind me of the streets around the college I went to - residential area for college students and professors. There are tall trees. The cracks in the sidewalk are still there. Things look kind of old and there is ivy growing on things. There are lots of flowers on the lawns. Then I get to an apartment complex with multiple levels. All of these levels are connected by stairs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, stairs and roller skates, not going to happen.\\u201d So I put my tennis shoes on. I can hear the group. Johnny is shepherding them at this point. My friend Ikaika who I have also known since second grade and grew up with is now in the group, too. They\\u2019re trying to go up one of the sets of stairs on the outside of the apartment building. There is a younger woman - well, she\\u2019s the same age as everyone in the group, we\\u2019re all younger than we are in real life, maybe in our twenties or early thirties. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, you cannot take this entire group through this apartment complex and go up these stairs.\\u201d It\\u2019s interesting because the streets I\\u2019m on are two or three levels above where the group is trying to climb the stairs to get up to these streets. So they\\u2019re definitely at a lower level of the road or something. Johnny is trying to bring them up the stairs and Ikaika is trying as well. Those two are super frustrated. I go and talk to the young woman. But I have to go through somebody\\u2019s apartment. It\\u2019s a college apartment so there are four people crammed into this tiny apartment and this is why the woman is saying, \\u201cNo, stop trying to bring this group of people up through this. It\\u2019s small and there\\u2019s not enough room for them! And you\\u2019re disturbing all of us who live here. You\\u2019re not taking into account the fact that we live here. You are singing loudly. You have kids. You have roller skates on.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her and she is pissed off. She\\u2019s not having it. She has blond hair down to her shoulders. Her skin is tan. She looks a bit ratty, not well kept. I go to talk to Johnny and Ikaika and say, \\u201cYou guys, we can go around. We don\\u2019t need to go through these peoples\\u2019 homes to get up to this next level.\\u201d They are so frustrated. They can\\u2019t see any other way than to come up the stairs. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, lets\\u2019 go around. There\\u2019s a road over here you can go up.\\u201d The dream ends here at an impasse with all these people trying to come up and this one girl trying to keep them out. I\\u2019m trying to convince them to go up around this road. No one arrives at a solution.\"],[\"I am outside. I keep going into a building but I\\u2019m not supposed to be inside because it\\u2019s reserved for other people. A convention or something is happening. I see my hula halau there - my kumu hula and all my hula sisters. They\\u2019re going to do a show. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome dance with us.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and am like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember any of the dances.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don\\u2019t remember the dances. They also don\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s like we haven\\u2019t practiced in a long time and we haven\\u2019t gotten together in a long time. But we\\u2019re all getting together for this. I feel so awkward. It\\u2019s really just affording me a reason for me to be in this building that I need or just want to be in. I\\u2019m not sure why. The halau is getting ready. I think I\\u2019m still in costume. I hide from them. I climb up a balcony or something. I\\u2019m not even taking stairs. I\\u2019m climbing things and definitely trespassing. I get to a classroom and it\\u2019s a kindergarten classroom. All the kindergarten decor is in there. I\\u2019m hiding in there. I think the teacher is trying to get the classroom ready because there aren\\u2019t a lot of kids. But there are some kids, so I think maybe it\\u2019s a school. I need to use the bathroom and it\\u2019s a little kid\\u2019s bathroom so the toilet is just two feet off the ground. I come out and have these feelings that I shouldn\\u2019t be here but don\\u2019t know why I need to be there. I head out of the classroom and climb back down and head back to the hula sisters. We do perform but I don\\u2019t know if I actually perform with them or watch. I wake up with this sense of not knowing what\\u2019s going on, I shouldn\\u2019t be here, I don\\u2019t have the skills, I don\\u2019t remember the dances, and none of this is my scene.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Josh, my beloved. We\\u2019re going to a Dane Cook show - the compedian (I haven\\u2019t listened to his shit in at least ten years). We\\u2019re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It\\u2019s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They\\u2019re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It\\u2019s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he\\u2019s done. I\\u2019m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it\\u2019s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term \\u201csausage fest\\u201d is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I\\u2019m a little confused as to why I\\u2019m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he\\u2019s finished with the set. He\\u2019s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, \\u201cWell, because you\\u2019re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, whatever!\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don\\u2019t know if Josh is still with me. I\\u2019m watching a soccer game. It\\u2019s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They\\u2019re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I\\u2019m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I\\u2019m not playing, I\\u2019m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I\\u2019m not sure who the team is that we\\u2019re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I\\u2019m wanting to play so bad. We\\u2019re outdoors at a soccer field and I\\u2019m actually sitting under a tree, it\\u2019s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I\\u2019m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I\\u2019m not playing and I\\u2019m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I\\u2019m not invited to play and it\\u2019s been a really long time since I\\u2019ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there\\u2019s busy work that has to happen. I\\u2019m watching the field morph. I can\\u2019t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I\\u2019m not part of it and I\\u2019m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don\\u2019t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. There\\u2019s my other friend Nani who I\\u2019ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m busy and I\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d She does sit with me for a little bit. While we\\u2019re sitting there, another girl comes up - I\\u2019m saying \\u201cgirl\\u201d because everyone is a teenager - and she\\u2019s got a project she\\u2019s working on. I ask her to show me. There\\u2019s wire wrapped around a needle and she\\u2019s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: \\u201cI can show you but I\\u2019m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.\\u201d It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s almost off work with the job she\\u2019s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she\\u2019s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, \\u201cOkay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you\\u2019re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.\\u201d She\\u2019s a local girl, so I can feel this air of \\u201cIck, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?\\u201d That\\u2019s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I am with my ex and his dad and some other family members, maybe some are my family members. I have to go do something but I\\u2019ve forgotten all my stuff. I turn to my ex and ask him to go get the things that I\\u2019m missing. The whole time I\\u2019m asking him, part of me is like, \\u201cWhy are you asking him for things? He can\\u2019t give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to do anything for you. Don\\u2019t ask him. Just do the things. If you do, you\\u2019ll owe him and that will make things worse.\\u201d I keep seeing this backpack full of things. He either has it or I have it, I\\u2019m not entirely sure. He does bring it to me. But the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, don\\u2019t accept this from him because then you will owe and you\\u2019ll never be free of him.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re younger, maybe early twenties. We\\u2019re gathered from all parts of the globe. It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There\\u2019s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cFor all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I signed up to be a bad guy.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We\\u2019re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She\\u2019s down below me and there\\u2019s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I\\u2019m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I\\u2019m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from \\u201cLilo and Stitch.\\u201d She\\u2019s talking to it and petting it while she\\u2019s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn\\u2019t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn\\u2019t have one, but I said, \\u201cThanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.\\u201d He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly understand that this meeting was about who was going to end up with one of those animals, like what she has. She moves on. I stand up and follow her into the kitchen. She\\u2019s moving as if she\\u2019s very busy and has to move onto the next task. The kitchen is also an office and there\\u2019s a huge fish tank. She is already giving instructions to someone else. I come up to her and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one of those things that you guys can create for me.\\u201d She stops talking and has a grin on her face and is like, \\u201cWell actually, you my dear, have enough power for three of these.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little taken aback and surprised. This woman has dark hair and reminds me a little bit of Helen but she\\u2019s not. They correlate to emotional superpowers, one is my ability to laugh and smile - at some point this thing smiled at me with all its sharp pointy teeth. She says, \\u201cYes, and you have two others.\\u201d There's something about shadow and something about fighting, warrior spirit. We all pile into cars and drive somewhere. I\\u2019m with my friend from the grocery store. We drive to a large gathering for all of us.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a house with a bunch of people. It\\u2019s kind of like an Airbnb we\\u2019ve rented. I don\\u2019t recognize all the people. I\\u2019m uncomfortable, for sure. I don't know what we\\u2019re doing in the house. There\\u2019s something we\\u2019re supposed to be doing as a group. I end up leaving the house. I go somewhere else. The house is in a city. I don\\u2019t know where I go, but I find myself trying to make my way back to the house but then driving a car. My dad is in the car and we\\u2019re going into the city through the backway to avoid the traffic and major roads. He\\u2019s in the passenger seat and asking me if I know where I\\u2019m going. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah dad, thanks, just be quiet and follow along. Don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make it to our conference.\\u201d But the GPS navigates me back to the house I had been at. This house had a lot next door to it with a rundown house and a bunch of land that was run down. When we get back, the house next door that was run down now is occupied by a cute lesbian couple. They\\u2019re bakers. They\\u2019ve fixed up the house. The gardens are all fixed up. They have right down the road an off the charts bakery that\\u2019s super fantastic. So we get there and my dad\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t where we\\u2019re supposed to be.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I know. But the upside of this is this bakery is available to us and we need to stop and get water anyway.\\u201d So we go into the bakery. The floors are wood. There\\u2019s a section with the bakery case. It\\u2019s packed! There are so many people - tourists from all over the place and locals. I go in and we walk up to the counter. I say, \\u201cI hear you guys are famous. Do you have grain-free and dairy-free desserts? I can\\u2019t eat those other things.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cIn fact, we do.\\u201d So they take me down to the far end of the case and show me the items that I can have. I\\u2019m so excited about it. My dad\\u2019s excited about it, too. We order the items we can order. But it takes a while for them to get them to us because there are so many people who have ordered and there are so many people in front of us. We wander off from the area to grab a water out of these coolers. There are drink coolers that seem out of place because the bakery is super cute, like a French bakery feel, but off in the corner with tables for eating is a Coca Cola drink cooler. It looks so out of place! I grab a water but am like, \\u201cEh, what are these doing here?\\u201d The tables are super close together. I\\u2019m trying to get through the tables and keep running into people. In my mind I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is not coronavirus six feet.\\u201d But no one is wearing masks and everyone is close. As I go through, there\\u2019s a table with an Asian woman sitting, and there\\u2019s a black man sitting at a table next to it. I\\u2019m trying to go in between them, but I\\u2019m rubbing legs with both of them to get to the drink cooler. The Asian woman gives me a dirty look. The black man is like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019ll get out of the way,\\u201d but he\\u2019s giving me this mischievous grin and there\\u2019s a twinkle in his eye because we\\u2019re touching. I grin at both of them and just say \\u201cexcuse me,\\u201d and go to the drink cooler and get a water for me and a soda for my dad. I go back through the big group. It\\u2019s still super crowded. I go back to the case where they\\u2019re handing out the desserts. I get there and am like, \\u201cHey do you have my dessert?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe called you and you didn\\u2019t come. It\\u2019s taken us a while, but we have it.\\u201d I\\u2019m kind of getting scolded, but they give it to me anyway. It doesn\\u2019t look as pretty as it would have because it\\u2019s been sitting for a little bit. I\\u2019m a little disappointed, but I take it anyway. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFor sure, for sure, this is dairy-free and grain-free?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYep.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and am like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s full of dairy if I\\u2019ve ever seen a dessert full of dairy.\\u201d But I take it anyway. I\\u2019m going to head out and eat it. Then I sort of wake up because in real life the wind blows so hard it rattles the trees at my window. It\\u2019s very startling, but I fall back to sleep and dream some more. But that\\u2019s all I can remember.\"],[\"I am hosting a party. I\\u2019m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There\\u2019s a fireplace. There\\u2019s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I\\u2019m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We\\u2019re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they\\u2019re here at the party for a reason, but there\\u2019s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don\\u2019t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what\\u2019s up. They\\u2019ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There\\u2019s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what\\u2019s being discussed, but it seems like there\\u2019s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don\\u2019t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what\\u2019s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we\\u2019ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. Let\\u2019s do that. We\\u2019ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.\\u201d It must be cold outside because there\\u2019s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What\\u2019s funny is they didn\\u2019t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it\\u2019s freezing. So there\\u2019s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don\\u2019t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they\\u2019ll put them near the fire. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I\\u2019ll just go put them in the fire.\\u201d But the shoes don\\u2019t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they\\u2019re wearing are mismatched. There\\u2019s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There\\u2019s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I\\u2019m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It\\u2019s like somehow we\\u2019ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it\\u2019s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they\\u2019re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it\\u2019s just me in the end. I\\u2019m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can\\u2019t remember what the changes are now. I\\u2019m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I\\u2019m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not a good idea. You\\u2019re a woman, this isn\\u2019t a good idea for you.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they\\u2019re leaving telling him: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She\\u2019s going to do what she\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn\\u2019t have to say and stop trying to control her. I\\u2019m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn\\u2019t being heard by my dad. I couldn\\u2019t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I\\u2019m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I\\u2019m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss\\u2019 artwork but the customer\\u2019s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I\\u2019m printing it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t your artwork.\\u201d She comes and looks at it and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely not.\\u201d There are huge instructions in the order and I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cNo. We don\\u2019t print other people\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m not going to do this.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d We look over and there are packages with more of this customer\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.\\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I\\u2019m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they\\u2019re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, \\u201cOh, who is that?!\\u201d My friend is there, too, and I think she\\u2019s in the room with somebody, but she\\u2019s not because she\\u2019s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn\\u2019t her. We\\u2019re all like, \\u201cWho was that?!\\u201d We walk down the hall and it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don\\u2019t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey can I get one of those? I want a turn!\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he\\u2019s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I look at him like, \\u201cCan I get a turn?\\u201d and he blushes and is like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the living room of my childhood home. There are a ton of people coming and going; some of them are my siblings, some are my siblings\\u2019 classmates, and I think some are my classmates, too. They\\u2019re all on a mission of some sort. I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing, but they\\u2019re coming home from some event they were at or some project they were doing. There are a lot of people, at least twenty, in the living room and more people outside. At one point I see a huge outrigger canoe being rolled through the yard and into the living room, which magically expands to fit it. I\\u2019m lying on a couch and pretty tired. I\\u2019m exhausted and just watching them come and go. People are stopping to talk with me but I\\u2019m not really involved in whatever is happening or whatever mission they seem to be on. At one point I sit up and look out to the driveway and the hedge that separates our house from the neighbor house. Behind the hedge is a gigantic tree with a treehouse in it. It looks like an oak tree in the way the trunk and branches are growing but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an oak because this is Hawaii. I\\u2019m watching people climb up and down the tree - it\\u2019s a treehouse but also an obstacle course with places where you can work out. It\\u2019s all somehow in this tree. I\\u2019m watching other people working out. Then I see a real tiger, orange and black, climb the tree and do the workout. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhoa, I didn\\u2019t know tigers could move like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m watching the tiger the whole time because I\\u2019m fascinated by what it\\u2019s doing and how it can do it, and also that it seems to be listening to the people. It\\u2019s as if it\\u2019s taking instructions from the humans - maybe not verbally, but from watching and then doing what they\\u2019re doing. Then the tiger climbs out of the tree and I think it\\u2019s going into the house through the backdoor. It\\u2019s at the backdoor and doing pullups on this pullup bar in the door. I see my brother (the one with the sustained traumatic brain injury in real life, but in the dream he\\u2019s normal and doesn\\u2019t have it). He is trying to pick up the tiger and use the tiger as a weight. The tiger is getting pissed off about this and doesn\\u2019t like it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMaybe you should put the tiger down.\\u201d He figures it out on his own. This whole time, the tiger is the most fascinating thing even though there are other people around. The tiger is acting like a tiger but also like a human. At some point it does come up to me and I just look at it and it looks at me, but I don\\u2019t hear anything and it doesn\\u2019t give me any verbal messages. I just know we have a moment of looking at each other. This part of the dream dissolves. Now I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood. I\\u2019m young, maybe five or six. There are two houses. I go into one house and there are a bunch of younger kids and two dads. I\\u2019m now my current age. The moms are not there and the dads don\\u2019t know how to feed the kids. They\\u2019re both watching tv, but then they see me and are like, \\u201cOh good! A woman to take care of things.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? No.\\u201d I walk out of the house. Then I walk down the street in this neighborhood -I\\u2019m definitely in the suburbs. I walk into the second house. This house is dark and dingy. There\\u2019s at least one man in here and maybe some kids. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw, danger.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to be in there. I can tell it\\u2019s not the place for me. There\\u2019s nothing here for me. This whole time I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood, I\\u2019m looking for something but I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m looking for. I do know that this house is not it. I leave that house and go back to the other house. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well I guess I will help you guys out because you\\u2019re better than the other house.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat, we need a pie made.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOkay, well show me all the stuff.\\u201d As soon as I say yes to making the pie, the dads pulls out this box of frozen foods they weren\\u2019t feeding the kids until they had permission from me. It\\u2019s a box of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fish sticks and frozen pizzas - basically junk food. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat now we can eat all this stuff and feed the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh god, this is a terrible idea. Where is the stuff to make the pie. I\\u2019ll make the pie and at least that will be good.\\u201d They show me this piece of cardboard with perforated cutouts of leaves and vines. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with it but I start pushing those through because I think I\\u2019ll maybe use them for the pie. Then the dads want to start talking business and how they\\u2019re going to pay me for this work. They hand me a leather jump rope with wooden handles. It\\u2019s folded four times. I have it in my hands and they\\u2019re talking about payment. As I\\u2019m listening I think they\\u2019ve got it all wrong. They don\\u2019t know how much labor is worth or how the pay schedule works. I\\u2019m talking about financial investments and using the jump rope to help explain. I\\u2019m untying the rope to show them how payment works. This is the most bizarre part of the dream because I don\\u2019t remember what I was saying or how a jump rope relates to finance, but somehow it did.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been asked to start and run a restaurant. The bare bones of the restaurant are in place - there\\u2019s a kitchen and a place for people to eat and a menu that I created. But there\\u2019s no staff. I have to do the cooking, serving and cleaning up all at once. The people who are eating know this is an experiment. There are three tables of people. They\\u2019re all putting in their orders and are very expectant. It\\u2019s just me. And there\\u2019s one other person who\\u2019s watching me and helping me a little, waiting for my direction, but more observing. I\\u2019m panicked because there\\u2019s too much to do. There\\u2019s no way to cook and serve and clear the tables and get everyone\\u2019s order and fill the water glasses all at the same time. It\\u2019s just too much. I\\u2019m trying as hard as I can. Everything is white in this restaurant - white table cloths, white walls, white floor - and part of it seems outdoors, there is no ceiling. After the meal is entirely served and I\\u2019m all done, the tables have nothing but complaints about the service, the food and how terrible everything was. I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou all volunteered for this and you knew that it was just me and I said it was not going to do all the things. But you guys all wanted this and you did it anyway. And now you\\u2019re critiquing me for it when I told you it wasn\\u2019t possible for me to do everything and I would need help.\\u201d I was panicked and frustrated.\"],[\"I\\u2019m looking at my phone and I\\u2019m with Josh and getting texts from Hank. Hank and Wendy used to co-own the CrossFit gym I used to go to. Hank is texting me about meeting up with him. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with him and think it\\u2019s weird that he\\u2019s even texting me. I say yes even though I don\\u2019t know what he wants. The scene shifts from me looking at my phone to being at a coffee shop. I\\u2019m with Josh and we\\u2019re hanging out. I have this feeling that Hank is going to meet up with me here and Wend6 is going to be there, too. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with them and don\\u2019t know why I agreed to meet with them. But I very distinctly remember seeing the text message where I said, \\u201cOkay great,\\u201d to Hank\\u2019s request to meet me somewhere. They both show up. I see Wendy first. She doesn\\u2019t seem like herself. She\\u2019s actually really happy and her hair is dyed blond. She has a smile on her face. She says hi to me. I\\u2019m wary like who is this and why is she saying hi. But she says hi then goes on with her business. She has her kids and she\\u2019s meeting a friend. Hank shows up and goes to give me a creepy hug like he used to give me. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh don\\u2019t, Josh is right there and he\\u2019s not going to like that. I don\\u2019t even know why I\\u2019m meeting with you and why I said yes. Don\\u2019t hug me in that creepy way.\\u201d The hug is like the lingering kind with lingering hands. Hank is also really happy to see me. I\\u2019m hesitant and I can see that Josh is wondering what\\u2019s going on here. Josh is looking less and less like himself as the dream progresses. He\\u2019s sitting at a table sitting out towards the coffee shop on a bench. There\\u2019s a chair on the other side of the table facing him and the chair is where I was going to sit, but that\\u2019s where Hank wants to sit and talk. I have all this hesitation about meeting up with them. Then the scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a Jeep. I'm driving around. It\\u2019s either Wendy\\u2019s or somebody\\u2019s. Josh is in the passenger seat and he\\u2019s upset and is like, \\u201cWhy did you meet with them?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember the gist of the conversation, just the feeling that he wasn\\u2019t happy with me and I was confused that I would agree to meet with them and confused by their super friendly reaction to me when I don\\u2019t think they would be friendly in real life.\"],[\"I wake up in the morning at my house and decide to take myself out to breakfast or lunch at a restaurant. I get all dressed up so I have earrings and all these rings with diamonds. One of the rings has a bigger diamond with smaller diamonds all around it. It looks like an antique setting and it\\u2019s really gorgeous. I go to this restaurant but it\\u2019s not even open yet. The servers are there and getting ready for the day. For whatever reason, one of the servers lets me in and he waits on me. He sits me at a table a little out of the way so they can keep getting ready for when they actually open. There\\u2019s a cook in the kitchen, a woman. The server is a guy. I start ordering off the menu. I order all kinds of food that I normally wouldn\\u2019t be able to eat, like pasta. At one point, I take my earrings off and they turn into fuzzy caterpillars. I also take my rings off and set them down on the table. The tablecloth is red and white checkered. I start to eat my pasta and it has marinara sauce on it. Then the server and cook come and sit down with me and have their pre-shift snack. So they\\u2019re eating with me. I think they\\u2019re eating the pasta, too. The noodles are the short curly noodles. We\\u2019re having a conversation and I\\u2019m realizing that they went out of their way to feed me even though they aren\\u2019t even open. Then I suddenly realize I\\u2019m eating pasta and maybe I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that. It doesn\\u2019t cross my mind until after I\\u2019ve eaten almost the whole bowl that this might have consequences. I finish. They clear the table and I grab all my rings and put them back on. I go to put my earrings back on but I can\\u2019t find them - the caterpillars. I\\u2019m still hanging out at the restaurant as the rest of the servers and bussers show up along with everyone who is there to help open. I move myself to a table at the edge of the restaurant so I\\u2019m out of the way while I try to put all my jewelry back on. I\\u2019m just watching as everyone gets ready. They\\u2019re all interacting with each other, laughing and playing and having a good time while they do their work. I feel kind of awkward the whole time because they\\u2019re not even open yet and here I am. The servers, men and women, talk with me and interact with me. I find myself remembering what it was like when I used to be a server and wondering how much they make in tips in cash each night and what they do with it - whether or not they report the cash tip or just the credit card tips to avoid taxes being taken out. The restaurant finally opens. I have a flash of seeing a football team playing a game from this table where I\\u2019m at. I look out of the restaurant over a field to where the football players are playing a game. I\\u2019m still trying to find my earrings and I can't find them. I\\u2019m trying to fit the big antique ring with the huge diamond and the smaller diamonds around it on my finger but I can\\u2019t quite get it on. All the rings are on my left hand and on all the fingers except my thumb. I\\u2019m trying to fit this older antique ring over my wedding ring finger and I don\\u2019t quite get it on, but I\\u2019m holding onto it so I don\\u2019t lose the ring.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in my condo. It\\u2019s dark and it\\u2019s Friday night. I\\u2019ve just taken the kids to their dad\\u2019s. I\\u2019m looking forward to having time to myself and time with Josh. I hear a noise. I get up out of bed and go out into the living room, which is pitch black. My son and brother are on the couch but they\\u2019re both young, like six or seven. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cDad just dropped us off.\\u201d I\\u2019m so confused because I just dropped them off at their dad\\u2019s house and I\\u2019m supposed to have all this time to myself and here they are and they\\u2019re sick. I\\u2019m trying to text my ex, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to have the kids right now. They\\u2019re sick. You left them here. I have plans for this weekend. It\\u2019s not my time with them.\\u201d My ex comes down from the stairs and starts telling me something. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care what your story is and I don\\u2019t know why you\\u2019re in my house but you need to take the kids out.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling super upset and start to feel that I have a sore throat in real life, as if whatever is happening in the dream is actually physically affecting me like I\\u2019m going to catch strep or something. This is something that did happen a lot when I was with my ex because he\\u2019s a strep carrier. In the dream, the kids are hot and sick and their voices are scratchy. I can tell they feel lonely because I\\u2019m trying to text their dad to come get the kids and then he shows up and argues with me about how I have to keep them. Then I start to get the sore throat in real life. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m with Josh at his house. He drinks coffee in the morning and I drink matcha. I\\u2019m trying to make my matcha and there are all these coffee mugs all over the counter and dirty dishes and water in the sink with soap and dishes in it and dishes in the strainer. I think I poured my matcha into a mug but it\\u2019s actually a glass and it\\u2019s hot so that\\u2019s not going to work because there\\u2019s no handle on the glass. I\\u2019m watching Josh drink his coffee. He\\u2019s drinking out of a cup with the Sun Tarot card on the front. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, I want a better mug for my matcha that has a Tarot card on it.\\u201d I look in the cupboard and see one with the Lovers on it. There\\u2019s a random Six of Swords, too. I take the Lovers, obviously. I go to switch mugs and stop and do the dishes. Josh is trying to tend to me but he\\u2019s a little distracted because his dad\\u2019s in the house and his sister is in the house. His sister has some friends there and his dad has some friends. There are people in the house who are supposedly friends of mine but I don\\u2019t recognize them. The house doesn\\u2019t look like Josh\\u2019s actual house. I go out into the dining room where everyone is. The dining room is dark and there\\u2019s a big long heavy wooden table that sits ten or twelve. The legs are thick and super sturdy and there are benches on either side. I see a bunch of younger kids hanging around. I\\u2019m feeling out of place because I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing there and I don\\u2019t really know anyone else. I think they\\u2019re Josh\\u2019s friends from before when he lived in Ohio. He\\u2019s talking with them and I\\u2019m trying to pay attention and be part of it, but I still don't have my matcha the way I want it. I go back into the kitchen to try and get it in a cup. I go to pick it up and the cup is leaking so it\\u2019s spilling everywhere. Josh tries to help me and I get the sense that he\\u2019s irritated with me because he\\u2019s trying to caretake me but also missing out on interacting with his friends. The scene shifts. Instead of being in a house, now we\\u2019re on a soccer field. It\\u2019s outdoors but there are lectures happening and it\\u2019s a bunch of Waldorf teachers lecturing. What\\u2019s so weird about this is Josh and his friends, who are all thugs because they started doing drugs when they were twelve and drinking and smoking, and then there\\u2019s me sitting in this little camping chair. A lot of people are sitting in those kinds of chairs. There are also some of my friends who are younger and parents who are my age with children. There\\u2019s one Waldorf teacher who I hired to tutor my daughter when she was younger. She is writing on the chalkboard, making beautiful pictures all in one fluid motion. I realize her piece of chalk which is a fat square is patterned, so as she writes the pattern on the chalk comes out onto the chalkboard. That doesn\\u2019t exist in real life as far as I know, but in the dream it does and it\\u2019s totally rad. She finishes her lecture and writing. I\\u2019m mouthing at her: \\u201cCan I see the chalk?\\u201d She hands it over. At some point I\\u2019m holding a baby, it\\u2019s not mine. It\\u2019s a three month old infant. There are also cats and dogs around. I don\\u2019t know who the baby belongs to, but I\\u2019m going to take care of it and watch over it and whoever\\u2019s it is will come eventually. I put the baby down onto the chair and go somewhere. I go swimming and I\\u2019m in the water with a bunch of people. I think Josh is in the water with me. I think we grow tails and are like mermaids from Harry Potter because we\\u2019re under the water. That shifts and I\\u2019m back out of the water. I go to find the chair I was sitting in with the baby. I can\\u2019t find the chair but I find another chair covered in blankets. I take the blankets off. There\\u2019s a dog leash attached to this chair and there\\u2019s a tiny, tiny baby, maybe a couple days old. The baby is about as long as my forearm. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh, whose baby is this?\\u201d I look up and turn around and the dad is right there. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s my baby, we\\u2019re watching it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh okay, good, somebody is watching this baby.\\u201d The Waldorf presentation continues and now there\\u2019s a projector playing some sort of music out onto a screen. I don\\u2019t know where this screen came from. We\\u2019re all still out on this gigantic field. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a wall of a building or a screen suspended from the sky. Josh has been around this whole time but he\\u2019s not actually with me. It feels kind of strange because there\\u2019s a little bit of space and estrangement between us. The projector is between Josh and I. Josh and his friends are leaning on a counter watching the screen. One of the Waldorf teachers turns to me and is like, \\u201cCan you go back in the back room?\\u201d The room is off to my left and off to Josh\\u2019s right because we\\u2019re facing each other across the space. In this room are a bunch of other adults and a guy with a video camera in his hands. He\\u2019s filming. The Waldorf teacher is like, \\u201cCan you go over there and tell that guy to stop filming or at least move because he\\u2019s showing up in the film that the projector is putting out onto the screen.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what is being projected - the images aren\\u2019t sticking in my memory. I go to move him but then I start showing up on the projector screen. The teachers are yelling at both of us. I don\\u2019t know how this is happening because the projector is over to our right and in front of us, he\\u2019s got a video camera in his hand and I\\u2019m behind him trying to tell him to scooch over a little bit. I don\\u2019t know how we\\u2019re ending up on the screen. I\\u2019m telling one of the Waldorf teachers, \\u201cI can\\u2019t help you. I don\\u2019t know what you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m telling them that they need to come and adjust whatever they want to adjust. I go back to where I was sitting. Josh comes over and is like, \\u201cI know you\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way but you\\u2019re really in the way.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cJesus, not winning here.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of women but I don\\u2019t know any of them at all. They\\u2019re younger, in their twenties and early thirties. We\\u2019re together on a boat, I think. There\\u2019s water everywhere. It\\u2019s clearly a group of witches. Most of them are just beginning to learn spellwork. I\\u2019m the only one there who knows how to do it. There are rituals happening or perhaps initiation. One of the younger women is guiding us through the process. I don\\u2019t know that I\\u2019ve actually received training and I already know how to do all of it and I\\u2019m just going along and it\\u2019s perfectly fine for me to be doing that. I don\\u2019t have any need to let them all know that I already know how to do all of it. I\\u2019m just there with them, watching and observing. Each woman is taking turns and we\\u2019re creating a circle. The woman who is leading all this is standing in the center and each woman being initiated is walking in a circle around the other woman and the rest of us are watching. I\\u2019m part of the crowd watching the younger woman in the center. As each woman goes and does her initiation and shows what spells she knows, she\\u2019s walking around the other woman in a circle. The thing is, we\\u2019re all walking on water. The boat or whatever we were on is around somewhere, but we\\u2019re off of the boat and each of us is either standing on water or walking on water. You can see the shore from where we are and it\\u2019s a rocky shore. Then it\\u2019s my turn to go and walk on water in the circle. There\\u2019s a dress I put on. This dress is a purple taffeta, shiny and stiff. The purple is a deep black purple and it shimmers with black. It\\u2019s very Victorain era looking with tons of folds and gathers and ruffles, but it\\u2019s not super girly, it\\u2019s quite elegant. I put this dress on and start walking the circle on the water. As I start to walk, my power starts to rise. I\\u2019m no longer hiding that I have power and know how to use it. The water starts to churn and with the other women the water was not churning. As I walk, the water starts to churn around and around. This is where I recognize that the dress I\\u2019m wearing is actually a dress of Helen\\u2019s, it\\u2019s a priestess dress imbued with power and I\\u2019m wearing it. The woman in the center who was leading us the whole time is a little startled because this hasn\\u2019t happened with the other women she was initiating. I have a little smile on my face because I know I\\u2019m invoking something that\\u2019s a little bit older than what any of them have ever seen and that I\\u2019m calling on the water elemental and the air elemental as the wind starts to blow. I can hear that Helen has shown up or her presence has shown up. She\\u2019s whispering in the ear of the woman in the center and the woman in the center is in awe. She thinks Helen is a guide from somewhere and she\\u2019s quite in awe. I know who it is and I can hear what she has to say and it\\u2019s all wise teachings, but the awe is not there for me because I know who it is. The woman in the center passes on as Helen speaks it as prophecy. I sort of grin and let her speak as I continue walking my circle and creating this water vortex that is spinning. Then my turn is over and it\\u2019s time for some of the other girls to go. This vortex I created with the water and wind stays and adds itself to the ceremony ritual happening. The woman in the center keeps babbling on about how wise and mystical this guide is. I say, \\u201cYes, she\\u2019s quite wise and ancient and she\\u2019s very powerful,\\u201d knowing it was Helen speaking but what was channeling through her were the powers of Avalon that are very ancient and old. But I don\\u2019t tell any of the other participants what it is because it seems it\\u2019s over their head and this is a good first mystical experience for them. The dream ends with us dispersing. We leave the water and the boat but I don\\u2019t know where we all go.\"],[\"There are three or four black women, I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re actresses. They\\u2019re going on stage. One is stunningly beautiful and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who needs to be on stage.\\u201d I keep wanting to build her up and make sure she knows how beautiful she is. For some reason she\\u2019s not seeing how beautiful she is. I\\u2019m trying to convince her through showing her.Then I have berries which look like blueberries. I\\u2019ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don\\u2019t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I\\u2019m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don\\u2019t know who. I\\u2019m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I\\u2019m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it\\u2019s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard. I can see this cartoonish looking town through the branches and it\\u2019s dark and there are lights on. The roads are very hilly and windy.\"],[\"I am talking to a detective who I\\u2019m hiring to go watch my ex-father-in-law and my dad who are supposed to be taking turns watching my son who is an infant. They\\u2019re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don\\u2019t work. The reason I\\u2019m hiring this detective is because I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re watching my son very well and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s entirely safe. They\\u2019re watching him for me because I\\u2019m working and I don\\u2019t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They\\u2019re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It\\u2019s odd that they\\u2019re together because they don\\u2019t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they\\u2019re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who\\u2019s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they\\u2019re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I\\u2019m observing this whole thing. I\\u2019m on the pool deck somewhere but they don\\u2019t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They\\u2019re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you\\u2019re both talking shit about me and the fact that I\\u2019m not around to watch my son and it\\u2019s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I\\u2019m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can\\u2019t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law\\u2019s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn\\u2019t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.\\u201d My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There\\u2019s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I\\u2019m having them watch my son in the first place. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson\\u2019s mom to him. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I\\u2019m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, \\u201cPick a spot.\\u201d All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that\\u2019s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don\\u2019t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it\\u2019s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they\\u2019re taking the exam. I don\\u2019t have my books. In fact I didn\\u2019t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I\\u2019m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don\\u2019t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I\\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don\\u2019t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn\\u2019t miss too much and I could just get someone else\\u2019s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.\"],[\"I was at a beach with a couple of friends and the only one I recognize is my friend, who is a lifestyle dom and I\\u2019ve really had a good time observing her and working with her and getting to know about being a dom from her. In the dream we are at the ocean. We\\u2019re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it\\u2019s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I\\u2019m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She\\u2019s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We\\u2019re on a culdesac. It\\u2019s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I\\u2019m not sure whose. I\\u2019m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it\\u2019s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I\\u2019m not sure. There are adults and kids. I\\u2019m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I\\u2019m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I\\u2019m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cCould you hurry up? You\\u2019re taking a long time and why do you need that?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBecause I like it.\\u201d Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn\\u2019t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don\\u2019t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there\\u2019s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn\\u2019t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, \\u201cWhy am I taking off this thing that I like?\\u201d I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn\\u2019t like it and was all judgmental about it. The dream ends there with that going through my head.\"],[\"A journey to a house. I\\u2019m coming to a house from somewhere else. This house is huge and it\\u2019s quite grand, almost like a mansion but not quite as big. It\\u2019s very spacious and there is a lot of open space. The house is a house that someone is letting me and other people stay in. i\\u2019m the original person that the house owner let stay and I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m paying a really reduced rent or what. I\\u2019m the person whose name is on the lease or rental agreement. I have a bunch of other people living there with me because it\\u2019s a huge house. I\\u2019ve been on vacation somewhere and have just come back to the house. Josh is with me. He\\u2019s dragging his feet and is not excited about being back in this house. He keeps complaining about it not feeling like home and being too big. He\\u2019s also the only male in the house. The other people I\\u2019ve let the house out to are all women. When we walk in the door, there\\u2019s a bunch of women, all blonde and middle aged, very nice. They\\u2019re doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen area with the concrete countertops. It\\u2019s very open with windows that look out. I realize I have some things to clean up and am looking through drawers trying to find towels to mop up the mess. Then my friend, Nani from high school who I haven\\u2019t seen since she left high school her Junior year to move to California. She\\u2019s wandering around and is not talking a lot, she doesn\\u2019t have a whole lot to say. I go and follow her to the space she\\u2019s occupying. She\\u2019s taken up the den or the parlor. She\\u2019s put a bed in it and it\\u2019s super cute, I love the way she decorated it. It\\u2019s open to the rest of the house but you do have to go around a corner set of stairs to get to it. I\\u2019m wondering how she feels about not having a lot of privacy. I say hi to her and go back into the kitchen. Josh is there moping and sitting on the steps. The stairs are kind of crazy, a really big set of stairs with no railing on one side. You go up the stairs and hit a landing then turn and go up a second set of stairs. The second set of stairs is between two walls so there are rooms on either side at that point. The first part has no railing at all. We go up and our bedroom is up there. He\\u2019s sitting on the stairs and I think he comes up the stairs with me. I\\u2019m noticing as I go up into what would be our bedroom how empty it feels and it doesn\\u2019t actually feel like home. There are other bedrooms where other people are staying as well. The house is so big and it seems like it keeps getting bigger or there are more doors. I come back down the stairs and walk back through the kitchen and dining room area. The dining room has a big dining table and a big chandelier over the top. Off the dining room is another hallway and there are more rooms back there. We walk back there. This is where the two blonde ladies are saying, they have a space back here. It\\u2019s pretty comfortable. I\\u2019m looking and I realize the panel has a door and I suddenly see it. Josh is still moping somewhere and he\\u2019s on his phone and complaining about how he wants to go home or he wants to go where people know him. All I can think is we have this great place and there\\u2019s an adventure to be had because I just realized there\\u2019s a doorway into something else and he\\u2019s not ready. The words that keep coming through my head are, \\u201cYou\\u2019re just really immature and moping like a little boy so why don\\u2019t you do that because clearly you need to do that. I\\u2019m going in through this door to see what\\u2019s there.\\u201d I open up the door. Initially I just poke my head in to see what it is. I can see round hobbit doors and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is a portal into another realm, I can totally tell.\\u201d I look over my shoulder and see Josh being mopey and sad. I leave him and go in. it\\u2019s this hallway with all these doors off it and also a common area which is basically under where the stairs would be. The wood grain seems a bit shimmery and mirage-like. I walk in and run into all these women, but they\\u2019re not human. They\\u2019re all different kinds of fae. They\\u2019re talking to me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHi, I didn\\u2019t know this was here. Where is this? What is this? How are you staying at this house?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh we just rent with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d They\\u2019re super happy to show me the place. There\\u2019s nor weirdness about me as a human being there. One of them has bronze skin and curly hair, one of them has a baby. The one with a baby is the one who talks with me the most. She keeps dropping her baby. She sets him down and he sits for a little bit but then his head gets heavy and he flops over backwards. He nails his head on the floor which is concrete but he doesn\\u2019t cry. She just picks him up and sets him up again in another precarious position. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you want to put him there, he\\u2019s going to flop over again.\\u201d Sure enough he falls again and smacks his head really hard and fusses a little bit, but she calms him. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s good for him but she doesn\\u2019t seem concerned so I just leave it be. She\\u2019s the one who explains to me who they all are. She keeps calling herself and the other people/fae the name but I can\\u2019t pronounce it so I just forget. Then I start asking her, \\u201cWhat are you all doing here?\\u201d When I had walked from the dining into that back room the house started to feel weird and I told her, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s an entity in this house and I need to smudge and clear it out.\\u201d Now that I\\u2019m talking to this woman beneath the stairs in fae land or wherever I am, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yeah, we\\u2019re here because we keep that thing at bay. But you guys feel it more in that part of the house.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh well, how do I get rid of it? It doesn\\u2019t need to stay here and I know I can get rid of it. Whatever the dark pall that is hanging over the house just needs to go.\\u201d I think Josh is depressed and that\\u2019s part of why he\\u2019s depressed. She says, \\u201cOh well, you can clean it out, but we mostly do the work of keeping it out in here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay awesome. I\\u2019m still going to try and get rid of it because it\\u2019s not necessary and it doesn\\u2019t feel good and it makes the rest of the house feel really yucky and uncomfortable to be in.\\u201d Then the dream ends here because I don\\u2019t remember coming out of that part of the house, I think I just woke up. I have the sense that everything is okay and this part of the house is where I want to be and I don\\u2019t know if I want to return to the other side.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a friend from the pole studio and we\\u2019re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it\\u2019s not even a possibility for me. We\\u2019re both running around looking for a pole to buy that\\u2019s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It\\u2019s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there\\u2019s no place to workout. We\\u2019re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it\\u2019s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can\\u2019t find what we\\u2019re looking for. I dream some more but don\\u2019t remember what it was. Suddenly I\\u2019m with a Native American man. He\\u2019s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I\\u2019m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don\\u2019t recognize anybody I\\u2019m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they\\u2019ve bonded somehow. I\\u2019m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We\\u2019re in the forest somewhere. He\\u2019s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, \\u201cYou have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why that\\u2019s important but that\\u2019s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I\\u2019m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we\\u2019re protesting capitalism, basically. We\\u2019re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We\\u2019re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that\\u2019s happening with these young kids and how they\\u2019re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh are we going to go in and stop them?\\u201d but the man is like, \\u201cNope, we\\u2019re just going to listen and we\\u2019re going to make food.\\u201d We\\u2019re making food to bring. There\\u2019s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it\\u2019s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I\\u2019m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We\\u2019re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that\\u2019s different from what\\u2019s being taught and told about at this parade. We\\u2019re doing a silent protest. I\\u2019m freaking out because it\\u2019s children that they\\u2019re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can\\u2019t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It\\u2019s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that\\u2019s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we\\u2019re seeing or if we\\u2019re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there\\u2019s this younger dad who\\u2019s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that\\u2019s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, \\u201cYou have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn\\u2019t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, \\u201cOh, I have magic powers? I\\u2019m going to show you my magic powers.\\u201d All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don\\u2019t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it\\u2019s hurting my people and other people. He\\u2019s just so enraged, he\\u2019s lost it. He doesn\\u2019t care who he hurts. I\\u2019m horrified because I\\u2019m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can\\u2019t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won\\u2019t stop. I finally go, \\u201cOkay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What\\u2019s really going on?\\u201d He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won\\u2019t talk to him and he hasn\\u2019t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she\\u2019s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it\\u2019s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, \\u201cAre you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?\\u201d He\\u2019s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they\\u2019re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he\\u2019s so hurt and wounded. We\\u2019re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we\\u2019re conversing we\\u2019re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He\\u2019s an older man, he\\u2019s bald and he\\u2019s wearing all black. He says to me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.\\u201d For whatever reason I see him and am like, \\u201cOh my god, oh no.\\u201d I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I\\u2019m in a towel, I don\\u2019t have my clothes on and don\\u2019t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I\\u2019m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It\\u2019s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn\\u2019t warn them and don\\u2019t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I\\u2019m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don\\u2019t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn\\u2019t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that\\u2019s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren\\u2019t even ground up. I\\u2019m eating in a safe place where this man can\\u2019t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.\\u201d I need to get clothes but I\\u2019m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don\\u2019t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m pretty incoherent. I haven\\u2019t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they\\u2019re part of the oppressor group.\"],[\"I am with one high school classmate, Janet, and some others - somebody\\u2019s parents and some other friends. We\\u2019re going to a park where we can camp and there\\u2019s also a house and cabins you can rent. We\\u2019re celebrating something. It\\u2019s very chill. There\\u2019s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there\\u2019s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you\\u2019d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you\\u2019d dive right onto the slide. It\\u2019s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it\\u2019s like a forest. There\\u2019s also an open area. We\\u2019re there celebrating and I\\u2019m actually starting to get concerned because I\\u2019m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it\\u2019s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, \\u201cUh, coronavirus is up and we\\u2019re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.\\u201d When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I\\u2019m wading into the water. I\\u2019m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it\\u2019s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it\\u2019s a shiny burnt orange color. I don\\u2019t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I\\u2019m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I\\u2019m getting uncomfortable because I\\u2019m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there\\u2019s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It\\u2019s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it\\u2019s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out. The water is pretty warm but when I come out, it\\u2019s cold, like about to start snowing cold. I bundle myself up and head back to the house that we rented. Now there are way more people in it. I\\u2019m crawling into a bed because I\\u2019m freezing. I\\u2019m first there by myself, but then all these other people show up and they crawl into the bed with me. The other people are older, like aunties and uncles and even grandmas. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope.\\u201d The sun has gone down. I change clothes so I\\u2019m warm and I go out of the house. There\\u2019s this guy, I don\\u2019t know him, maybe in his thirties with short dark hair. I noticed him by the pond earlier because he was there doing some work and he had this bronze statue of himself that was animated. He had made a copy of himself that was helping him with a project down there. When I come out of the house, he\\u2019s by the house with his bronze copy of himself. But the copy is misbehaving, it won\\u2019t do what he tells it to do. He\\u2019s trying to kill it and chop off its head in pieces. I\\u2019m a little freaked out by the whole thing because I get this eerie feeling that if he doesn\\u2019t do something about that copy of himself it\\u2019s going to wreak havoc on everybody and just start killing everyone. At some point, he manages to get control of it and chops it into pieces and puts it on a tarp and wraps the tarp up. I\\u2019m kind of grossed out by the whole thing. I don\\u2019t know what he does with the tarp. He\\u2019s definitely a musician because i see him go from there to setting up a ritual space. He brings all the elements in. He has rings on his fingers. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing and what he\\u2019s setting up. The dream shifts. I end up traveling somewhere else. I\\u2019m traveling with Josh. he\\u2019s feeling super beat down and his self esteem is in the toilet. He\\u2019s picking at acne on his body so badly that it\\u2019s leaving holes in his skin. He\\u2019s super fucking depressed. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re traveling to or from. I don\\u2019t even know what kind of vehicle we\\u2019re in but there are seats. I\\u2019m in a seat and he\\u2019s in a seat next to me. There\\u2019s seaglass, round and smooth, and some are pretty big like the size of the palm of my hand. They\\u2019re all different colors, red and purple and greens and blues. There are smaller pieces, too. It\\u2019s gorgeous and it\\u2019s his personal collection. I\\u2019m trying to hang onto this glass while we\\u2019re in this vehicle. At some point we\\u2019re flying because I look out the window and see clouds below us, but we\\u2019re also driving. I put the glass down and all of a sudden the vehicle accelerates and the glass falls off the shelf I put it on and shatters into so many tiny pieces on the metal of the floor of this vehicle. Josh is ambivalent about it and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, all of your glass!\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified because I put it there and it broke, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really care.\\u201d I\\u2019m super upset about it breaking and I feel bad. I\\u2019m also upset that he doesn\\u2019t care. I sweep up all the little shards and we put them in the trash. There are a few tiny pieces left and I gather those up and hang onto them. We get to where we\\u2019re going and we get out of this vehicle. We end up at a weird saloon bar place. It\\u2019s dark. We meet these two women who I think were our travel companions at one point. I don\\u2019t know who they are but they\\u2019re familiar to me in the dream. One of the women has a blond braid and the other has longer dark hair. They sit down at a table and ask the bartender for this type of alcohol that you usually need one shot of and you\\u2019re good. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take the whole bottle.\\u201d The bartender is like, \\u201cNo you won\\u2019t.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, we will.\\u201d Josh is like, \\u201cYeah, let them have it. I\\u2019ll take care of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo! They\\u2019re going to be obnoxious and terrible.\\u201d But by the time I look back, the two women have finished the bottle and the bartender is standing there with shoulders shrugged. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no.\\u201d Of course they get crazy. Josh starts feeding off of them energetically because he doesn\\u2019t drink at all. I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cUh oh, this is not going to be good, you\\u2019re going from depressed to manic.\\u201d They\\u2019re playing on a piano. It is like a saloon. There\\u2019s nobody else in there. The bartender is like, \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re closing.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re closing? You just got these two ladies wasted and there\\u2019s no place for us to go. We\\u2019re staying here.\\u201d The dream shifts. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I\\u2019m at, maybe a Costco type area. There\\u2019s a guy, older man maybe in his fifties, pot-bellied white dude with short hair. He\\u2019s used his body his whole life to work, you can tell, his hands are super callused. He\\u2019s hungry and he\\u2019s trying to figure out what to eat that is healthy. I\\u2019m standing looking at everything in the freezer section and am like, \\u201cOkay, if you eat this, this and this, it doesn\\u2019t have any dairy.\\u201d I was trying to find food that met the restrictions he had. I say, \\u201cThis pizza has a cauliflower crust and it\\u2019s non-dairy with fake cheese. It comes with these other items in the box, so you can buy the whole thing and that\\u2019s your meal.\\u201d There\\u2019s a microwave conveniently nearby. He heats it up and eats while we\\u2019re standing in the freezer section. He puts the tray down on his shopping cart, eats and enjoys it. The whole time he\\u2019s complaining about how expensive it is for him to eat this way even though he needs to because it\\u2019s becoming life or death. He needs to start eating in a more healthy way. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cYou can complain about the money it costs to buy this food or you can complain about the money it costs for all the healthcare you\\u2019re going to need. There are ways to cut down because you can buy food at the beginning of the week and meal prep and that saves money. You have containers in the fridge you can eat.\\u201d I\\u2019m going through all this stuff I know from my nutrition degree to help him out and simplify things for him. But I don\\u2019t know who he is and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this for him. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m getting paid for it or not. It seems like a lot of energy being put into this person who keeps saying over and over again, \\u201cThis is really expensive.\\u201d Eventually I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDo you feel better?\\u201d He says yes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s your choice. You can keep eating shit and keep feeling like shit or you can figure out how to do this. He doesn\\u2019t give me a response and I just wake up.\"],[\"This was kind of a weird dream. I\\u2019m looking for a house to buy. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m with my ex and the kids or some other family. I just know I\\u2019m with other people and we\\u2019re all looking at houses together. There\\u2019s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you\\u2019d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They\\u2019re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu\\u2019u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I\\u2019m looking and we decide not to buy it because it\\u2019s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I\\u2019m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They\\u2019ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren\\u2019t white anymore. They\\u2019ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m not comfortable with them. I\\u2019m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I\\u2019m not sure who it is; it\\u2019s a female person and we\\u2019re not really friends. It\\u2019s kind of like I\\u2019m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it\\u2019s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We\\u2019re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I\\u2019m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn\\u2019t feel a connection either, so she\\u2019s just gone. As I leave, I\\u2019m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I\\u2019m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn\\u2019t really resonance there anyway. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it\\u2019s just not for me.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Aila and her two kids. I\\u2019m not sure if my kids are around. We\\u2019re in her house and her house is gigantic because she hosts people in it. She hosts retreats in this house. The house has huge rooms and huge levels. Each level has its own set of dishes. We\\u2019re looking at all the dishes and cleaning them. One room was used and there\\u2019s a ton of dishes in the sink that need to be cleaned and put away. In another room I\\u2019m putting away props or items that had been used. There is a retreat going on, but maybe it\\u2019s not really a retreat because they seem to be friends of hers. I recognize all of them because I know a lot of her friends. They\\u2019re just here to hang out. One of the friends is setting up a tent in the yard under a bunch of trees with her daughter. Aila calls her over. Everyone starts talking for a little bit, but I don\\u2019t remember any particular conversation or how long that interaction lasted. There was a busyness with a lot of friends unpacking or doing other things. I\\u2019m in one of the rooms now with Aila and her kids. We\\u2019re cleaning up dishes. I also have this plant in my hand. I\\u2019m not sure where I got it. It has orange grasses but it doesn\\u2019t have a pot, so I'm trying to find a pot for it. One of the kiddos is cleaning this interesting bowl like a big gravy boat. All the dishes in the house are the exact same, just different shades of blue, turquoise, teal. One of the kids is cleaning this one that looks kind of like a round gravy boat. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019ll take that, it\\u2019s perfect for this plant.\\u201d I put the plant in it. Somehow I get this other plant that kind of looks like a lei. I put it over the other plant in the dish and it\\u2019s actually really pretty with the orange underneath and the one that looks like a lei with flowers. I don\\u2019t recognize the flowers and in fact, neither of these plants are like ones that I\\u2019ve seen ever in my whole existence alive on earth. Aila comes and looks. I think it upsets her because I'm smooshing the plant underneath. But I\\u2019m not sure if she\\u2019s upset but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cMaybe let\\u2019s move that to another place.\\u201d She\\u2019s very diplomatic in the way she says it. There\\u2019s more but I can\\u2019t recall.\"],[\"The feelings in these dreams were kind of strange. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what I was doing in any of them. I\\u2019m standing on a bridge with some other people. This bridge was at least two-hundred feet up from the water, really high up. It was a paved road so cards could go over it. There\\u2019s a huge gathering of people, so many, and I\\u2019m seeing them in the water. I have to look through a pair of binoculars to see them because they\\u2019re that far away. I\\u2019m trying to take a picture and am zooming in a lot to try and see everyone. Some of the people are waiting for me to jump in. I'm like, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re crazy, that\\u2019s way too much of a distance, that will kill me.\\u201d I do not know what happens after I try to take the picture, but I\\u2019m struggling to take it and refusing to jump in the water. Then dream happens. Then there\\u2019s another scene. I\\u2019m in a house that\\u2019s quite cute, like a studio house. The bedroom, living room, kitchen are all one area. It\\u2019s in Portland area. I think it's late summer because there are green leaves on the trees and they are just starting to turn and it\\u2019s warm. I\\u2019m standing in that house. The cabinets in the kitchen are painted white and it\\u2019s very bright and cheery, very airy, too. I don\\u2019t know who I\\u2019m with, they\\u2019re my partner though. I go out onto the porch and there\\u2019s a bunch of kids sitting on the porch. The kids have helmets on, like they\\u2019ve been riding their bikes or skateboards. I\\u2019m showing them how to do something, but I don\\u2019t know what it is. They\\u2019re playing video games and maybe they\\u2019re showing me how to play or I\\u2019m showing them. I don\\u2019t know why we\\u2019re playing video games because it\\u2019s a gorgeous day and I want for us to just be out.\"],[\"I am with Josh, my partner. I\\u2019m standing in the kitchen next to the sink. There\\u2019s a concrete floor. I\\u2019ve made a salad for both of us. Things are a little strained between us. I ask him if he wants to dress the salad. He goes to get the olive oil and he spills it everywhere on the floor. I\\u2019m extremely annoyed and upset about this. My reaction does not make sense for the mistake he made. He can see I\\u2019m made. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cClean it up.\\u201d He goes outside to get a hose. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is he doing? Get a rag to clean this up.\\u201d Somehow the oil is spreading. I watch him go outside. I can see a fig tree through the window. The window is the kind we have in Hawaii with the old panes of glass. There are all these huge gorgeous yummy figs on the tree and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I want to go pick those figs.\\u201d He\\u2019s out there getting the hose but he\\u2019s fucking around. Meanwhile the oil keeps spreading more and more. I don\\u2019t want to go out because I\\u2019d step in the oil and spread it some more. I can see there are chickens out there and the chickens keep trying to eat the figs. I yell at him through the window: \\u201cPick the figs!\\u201d He goes to pick them but he doesn\\u2019t have a basket to put them in. The chickens keep going after him. He\\u2019s still messing with the hose. Then he turns into my dad. He\\u2019s a bumbling idiot out there and I\\u2019m super frustrated with the whole thing. I leave the kitchen and all of a sudden I\\u2019m in a grocery store co-op. There are a ton of plants. Josh, who has turned into my dad, has the hose now and is trying to come into the house with it to clean up the oil and water the plants. I\\u2019m watching him walk through the kitchen into this back room that\\u2019s a co-op. In this backroom are tons of starts. He goes to water them, but he has the hose on super high pressure and he\\u2019s obliterating all the seedlings. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing? Where\\u2019s your common sense?\\u201d I\\u2019m so irate. At this point I just ignore him and the whole thing. I go into my room, but I don\\u2019t want it to be my room because it\\u2019s a smaller room. My sister is there but it\\u2019s not actually my sister, it\\u2019s another little girl who is my sister in this dream. She\\u2019s talking non-stop and I just want some space. I\\u2019m especially annoyed because she has the bigger bedroom and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do I have this little one?\\u201d She has this little piece of paper with a calendar on it. The calendar has been pulled out of a magazine and the magazine is the flyer or coupon book for the co-op. I don\\u2019t even know if the dates are right on the calendar, I think it\\u2019s last year. She\\u2019s pinned the calendar on the wall for me and I think that\\u2019s useful. But then I look at the dates and see that it\\u2019s not useful. She\\u2019s pinned it over the one window in my bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy have you pinned it over the window?\\u201d I go to pull it off and it has just regular blinds over the window. She goes, \\u201cBecause it stares into my room.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d Sure enough, I go and look and all I can see is her bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh yeah, let\\u2019s put curtains over that.\\u201d She goes to put a curtain over it and the curtain is the same color as the walls. The walls are a very light bright bluish green. I\\u2019m hating all of it. I don\\u2019t like this wall color, I don\\u2019t like this curtain and the curtain doesn\\u2019t , I don\\u2019t like the size of this room and I don\\u2019t like that she\\u2019s in here. This is not what I would choose for my space at all. Why the hell am I here? My mom comes in and is trying to smooth things over. I go outside. She follows me outside. We go outside because there is a gorgeous sunset happening and I want to catch the sunset. But I didn\\u2019t bring my phone or camera. I tell my little sister to grab my phone. I\\u2019m in my twenties or thirties and she\\u2019s six or seven. She takes her fucking time but by the time she comes back the sunset is gone. It was a beautiful glorious sunset. I try to pick a few of the figs for myself. Now I look up and in the night sky and I can see the Earth and Jupiter and Saturn making this cluster in the sky. I start taking pictures. I can see the continents, clouds and oceans of the Earth from where I\\u2019m standing, which I thought was earth, but apparently it\\u2019s not. Then to see Saturn and Jupiter, I think, \\u201cWell of course I can see them close together, it was the Great Conjunction.\\u201d All of a sudden Earth becomes a meteor and Jupiter and Saturn go with it. They start to burn up like when a meteor goes through Earth\\u2019s atmosphere. I\\u2019m panicking. I\\u2019m in the yard with the kids. I\\u2019m looking down and can see buildings like in a city. These two kids are Indian from India. They start to laugh as the Earth travels through the atmosphere and starts burning up. I\\u2019m horrified but they\\u2019re laughing like it\\u2019s the greatest prank in the world. Then I realize that it\\u2019s a ball and they somehow managed with magic to make it look like Earth and Jupiter and Saturn. It is going to burn up as it comes through the atmosphere and it will land and make an explosion, but it\\u2019s a ball because it stays the same size. They\\u2019re laughing hysterically because they\\u2019ve just pulled off this prank. I\\u2019m horrified because this entire dream I\\u2019ve just had this sense of where am I, why am I here, what am I doing...I\\u2019m trying to find bits of beauty, but I miss the sunset. I do see Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, but they seem to be fake. I go back into the co-op and the manager of the co-op is there now. The co-op is filled out now. I see grocery store shelves stocked with fruits and vegetables, and aisles with alternative flowers. The co-op manager is trying to hire people. He gets on the PA to talk about the benefits of working at the co-op. He says something like, \\u201cYou have at least one weekend day off.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo way! I would never work there.\\u201d I\\u2019m kind of laughing because he\\u2019s awkward on the PA system. But it does sound terrible the way he described it. The dream ends with me looking at him with a puzzled look on my face. My mom, dad and sister have all disappeared from the dream. There\\u2019s one other co-op employee hanging around and rolling his eyes as he hears the manager talk.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There\\u2019s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She\\u2019s cooking. I\\u2019m trying to load the dishwasher. It\\u2019s a very complicated dishwasher and I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in. She\\u2019s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There\\u2019s enough though. I\\u2019m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever\\u2019s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, \\u201cCan you please open this?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy? I don\\u2019t drink.\\u201d Even though it\\u2019s beer, it\\u2019s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are you all drinking?\\u201d We\\u2019re at a gathering, maybe it\\u2019s Christmas or New Year\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t know, but there\\u2019s a celebration happening. Of course, it\\u2019s my family, so they\\u2019re all drinking and I\\u2019m the only one that doesn\\u2019t drink. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy am I opening this bottle for her?\\u201d I think she\\u2019s trying to give it to me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, here\\u2019s your bottle of beer-wine.\\u201d I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I\\u2019m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird\\u2019s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn\\u2019t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s not my childhood home or even my home. I think it\\u2019s my mom\\u2019s home. I\\u2019m there to see her. I think I\\u2019m my current age. I\\u2019m sitting in the corner of the kitchen where the cabinets come together. I\\u2019m sitting on the floor. She\\u2019s yelling at me. My little brothers are there. They\\u2019re little again. My brother that was born right after me is also there, but he looks like he\\u2019s maybe just out of his teenage years. So maybe I\\u2019m in my early twenties. She\\u2019s yelling at me and my two youngest brothers. My other brother and I are going to take the kids on a trip. We\\u2019re going to the grocery store. We go to the grocery store in his white Tacoma truck (he doesn\\u2019t have one in real life). My brothers are in the car with us. We go to the grocery store and get all of our supplies. Then we go to check out and my brother decides the lines are too long for him and he\\u2019s pissed off. So he decides to take the cart full of groceries and somehow get them in the truck that\\u2019s now in the store. He drives the truck through these two doors. The regular sliding doors are not an option because there are a ton of people in there and a rent-a-cop. There are these two doors on the side which I don\\u2019t think a truck can fit through, but he drives through them anyways. The truck barely makes it through. He heads out into the parking lot which is full of people. I\\u2019m pissed at him like, \\u201cYou just fucking stole groceries! And you almost run over people. We need to go back.\\u201d He circles around the huge parking lot. He\\u2019s trying to park but we\\u2019re on a side of the building with an entire school\\u2019s worth of parents and kids. The kids are running around. This is where he decides to park. I\\u2019m getting more and more pissed because at any moment the cops are going to come and arrest us for stealing groceries even though I didn\\u2019t steal them. I\\u2019m also afraid he\\u2019s going to hit some of the kids running around this parking lot. The kids are kindergarten up through fifth or eighth grade. He parks in one stall that\\u2019s totally open with no one nearby. But then he decides he doesn\\u2019t like it, pulls out of it, and goes to find another spot to park. This stall is in between a minivan and SUV that have parked next to each other, but they haven\\u2019t parked straight, so the stall in between is not large enough for the truck. They parked so that no one could park near them because their kids are running around. But he picks that stall to park in. i\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?! You\\u2019re acting entitled. You\\u2019re not paying attention to other people and your surroundings. We need to pay for these groceries.\\u201d I finally get the groceries out of the truck and there are so many that I have to get two carts, so I put them head to head, which is kind of strange. He pushes them in, but he\\u2019s trying to go in the out doors. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to go over to the side where it says, In.\\u201d Because he was trying to go In the Out, there\\u2019s chaos with the amount of people at the checkout. We can\\u2019t actually make it in so we have to go in these other doors. We have to go around to get to the cash registers and pay. We\\u2019re on our way around and I\\u2019m pushing the cart. Somehow this guy with a baby on his back and holding the hand of a toddler, I manage to trip him. Really what happens is he wasn\\u2019t paying attention as I was trying to squeeze behind him. He turns and he trips. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh, are you okay?\\u201d He gets really upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. I should have made more noise so you could hear that I was behind you. Are you okay? Is the baby okay?\\u201d He stands up and starts to yell at me and my brother because in our hurry, we don\\u2019t have our masks on. This guy also doesn\\u2019t have his mask on because he\\u2019s pulled it down around his neck. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to have to cite you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope, hang on, don\\u2019t worry. I have my mask right here.\\u201d I pull my mask out to put it on and my brother pulls his mask out to put it on. I\\u2019m thinking this guy is going to be more upset about tripping and falling, but he\\u2019s more upset about the masks.\"],[\"It\\u2019s me and another woman who\\u2019s older than me, a white lady who I don\\u2019t know. I actually don\\u2019t know anyone in this dream. We both have an idea for a program we want to put together for others, and they\\u2019re slightly different. We\\u2019re supporting each other in getting it out into the world. Suddenly when we\\u2019re in a restaurant or gathering hall. There\\u2019s a guy who\\u2019s an MC and also really schmoozy and slimy. There are suddenly a lot of other people in this hall. There are tables where food is being served. The food is being catered. Me and this woman are sitting on a couch off to the side, in a lounge area. The guy is on the stage and he\\u2019s pitching our ideas to the audience. He\\u2019s trying to pitch each project separately for people to invest in them. All of sudden he starts having the people compete and choose one project or the other. He\\u2019s leaning a lot towards the older woman and her program, I think because there are enough similarities in our programs that he decides there should just be one. I\\u2019m sitting in the lounge on the couch and I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s fine. Don\\u2019t worry about it. You do your program and I\\u2019ll figure out something else to do. I actually don\\u2019t want any part of this because it feels gross. You go ahead and do your thing.\\u201d His presentation ends and the dinner ends. The people leave. I go from being someone who\\u2019s having an idea pitched to the help. I am now cleaning and clearing the tables. The bartender is still there and there are a couple others of us trying to clean and clear the tables. The bartender is like, \\u201cHey, leave the silverware but take any extra food.\\u201d There are these lettuce-wrapped sandwiches and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cTake any of those that are extra and put them in my fridge.\\u201d I keep picking them up in my bare hands. They aren\\u2019t even on a plate. They\\u2019re lettuce with turkey, tomato, cheese and mayonnaise on the inside. They\\u2019re sliding all over the place because they\\u2019re warm at this point. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYup, come put them in my little bar fridge.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little bar fridge and it\\u2019s overflowing and I keep dropping the sandwiches and they\\u2019re opening up and making a mess. He\\u2019s kind of starting to bitch at me. I\\u2019m kind of confused because it seems very unsanitary, but he wants to use them for the next dinner I guess. I don\\u2019t know what to do except keep grabbing the sandwiches and giving them to him. He\\u2019s so rude and abrasive and controlling that I\\u2019m also a little bit afraid of him.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a school and there\\u2019s a parent teacher conference. I think it\\u2019s a Waldorf School because kids are running around and it seems kind of loosey-goosey. There\\u2019s a kids counselor and their teacher. They're interviewing my ex and I. I get the sense that they\\u2019re trying to see who\\u2019s a more fit parent and who\\u2019s safer for the kids to be around. My ex goes first and they\\u2019re asking him all kinds of questions. One of the teachers is this older white man, he has this grandfatherly elder feel to him. One of the other teachers of interviewers is a woman, maybe in her late thirties or early forties. She has dark brown hair. My ex goes first and they\\u2019re asking him all kinds of questions. In the dream the conversation is very clear but I\\u2019ve forgotten now. His responses have this feel that he\\u2019s just trying to get at me and poke at me. He\\u2019s not being kind or fair and is straight up telling lies about my parenting. Then it\\u2019s my turn and I get in a couple of comments that insinuate or implicate my ex as being a covert narcissist and he\\u2019s lying and a lot of what he has to say is not true. But I end up saying, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we let the way the kids interact with me speak for itself?\\u201d The kids were on recess and we call them in. They\\u2019re younger than they are now. My son is three or four and my daughter is maybe seven. They\\u2019re happy to see mama and I get lots of hugs. They do their child thing and are just playing. Then my ex coms over and parents them. He\\u2019s rough. From my point of view he seems so fucking manipulative. The kids come to me and I know I\\u2019m being observed by these two people. I\\u2019m totally firm with whatever discipline needs to happen. I\\u2019m also really kind and loving. The kids clearly love me and are not afraid of me, which is what my ex was trying to convince this counselor and teacher of. The kids aren\\u2019t. I\\u2019m their mother. I can see that both the teacher and counselor are putting the puzzle pieces together and seeing who and what my ex really is. I think the dream ends there with me just being with the kids and them not being afraid of me, which is not the story that their dad was telling the counselor and teacher. Then the dream shifts. I have a flash of being in a neighborhood with almost all of my high school friends - the kids I grew up with and went to school with. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, except we\\u2019re at this place for an event or conference. Everyone is whispering, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Tupac concert!\\u201d But the rest are like, \\u201cAnd he\\u2019s dead! Why would it be a Tupac concert?\\u201d The venue has water bordering the edges, so I\\u2019m not sure if we\\u2019re at the ocean or a river. There\\u2019s water on one edge of the surroundings. The other side is a town. I\\u2019m sitting with my friends and we\\u2019re kind of close to the stage. Nothing is happening yet because there are hours until they come on. We\\u2019re all basically like, \\u201cis it going to be Tupac? This band says that it\\u2019s Tupac but everyone knows he\\u2019s not alive anymore, so how is it possible?\\u201d The crowd keeps gathering and it\\u2019s more and more people that I know and grew up with. Then people that know my people are there, so it\\u2019s like six degrees of separation between everyone that\\u2019s there. We\\u2019re sitting at this table and they start to block off the stage and dancing areas. There\\u2019s a big block between the stage and where everyone is allowed to stand and watch. They allow me and my two friends to stay, but they remove the table so we\\u2019re just sitting there in these chairs. It\\u2019s getting kind of awkward because now everyone is staring at us and wondering why we\\u2019re in this space where no one else is allowed to be. Then, also everyone is staring because they\\u2019re anticipating this band coming up to play. I\\u2019m getting uncomfortable and at one point I realize my pants have disappeared and I\\u2019m in a bodysuit with snaps down at the bottom - this is kind of funny because it\\u2019s the kind of clothes my mom used to wear in the 1970s. It\\u2019s black. My friends are up and then they come back down and I\\u2019m just feeling so uncomfortable because everyone is watching me and I\\u2019m in just this bodysuit. I look down at one point and the snaps have come undone and my pussy is just hanging out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god! I hope no one saw that.\\u201d I tilt my body to the side and my friend helps me snap everything back so everything is covered. Then it\\u2019s time for the band to come on. They come on and they have all different kinds of instruments - saxophones and drums and guitar. I know Tupac is a rapper, but all the instruments on the stage are varied. Then the singers come on. Of course, it\\u2019s not Tupac. It\\u2019s a band and they start playing music. Everyone realizes Tupac is not coming out. It\\u2019s some kind of tribute band or something. I\\u2019m really ready to get out of this space where I feel like I\\u2019m on display and it feels so uncomfortable. The crowd has a bunch of kids in it. The kids are starting to run past the barricade that they have up to keep people away from the stage. The kids are starting to run in this grassy area where I\\u2019ve been this whole time. The security is letting some go but trying to catch some. I can\\u2019t tell if the kids are allowed to be there or not. I just know I\\u2019m ready to peace out. The music is also not very good. The dream ends with me leaving and the kids running amok and the band is not Tupac.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of people who are Irish river dancing. They\\u2019re all in traditional costumes but the costumes are wrong - they\\u2019re Swedish or Danish costumes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll watch this.\\u201d What\\u2019s weird is I\\u2019m watching Hank and Wendy. They\\u2019re dancing as part of the troupe. In my brain, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god, what are they doing in my dream again?\\u201d They\\u2019re dancing. Wendy comes up to me. Her hair is longer and she\\u2019s wearing a dress - I\\u2019ve never seen her in a dress, ever. She\\u2019s being really, really nice to me and I think she invites me to come dance or something. I decline. I\\u2019m with my partner Josh and we\\u2019re sitting and leaning against something. There\\u2019s an ingrown hair on my leg and it\\u2019s pretty painful. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ll get it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh, don\\u2019t touch it!\\u201d He reaches towards it and it\\u2019s on my left leg on the top of my thigh towards my knee. He goes to pop it and it squirts this huge amount of pus out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHoly shit! Was that just an ingrown? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I clean up all the pus and stuff that came out. He goes and pops it again. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLeave it alone.\\u201d But more stuff comes out and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d Now it\\u2019s fibrous. I clean that up then pop it one more time. Then tissue comes out of my leg. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough. Leave the freaking theme alone.\\u201d Weird stuff is coming out and I don\\u2019t know what is happening to my leg.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at my childhood home. It really does look like my childhood home. The backyard is like what I\\u2019m used to seeing. The house is just kind of like I know it, some of the pieces are the same. In the backyard now there is a lanai that goes all the way out and it\\u2019s glassed in with doors that have eight little square window panes. It looks like a greenhouse or sunporch. It also has an English period feel to it. It\\u2019s very bright. The sunroom is painted white. There\\u2019s silver everywhere - silver serving platters and whatnot. We\\u2019re not dressed fancy or anything; we\\u2019re in Hawaii and dressed comfortably. I see a plate of bacon on the porch. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes! Bacon!\\u201d I go to eat it and my mom is like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s from so and so, she brought it over. She\\u2019s trying it out to see if it\\u2019s the kind we like or want.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s interesting and wonder why they would be doing that. I know sometimes bacon is coated in flour and now I\\u2019m wary of trying it because I know I\\u2019m allergic. Then my brothers are showing up and they\\u2019re demolishing the bacon. When I look out at the backyard, I can see the stream and the cliff wall on the far side - I\\u2019ve had this in other dreams before. I\\u2019ve dreamt this landscape in dreams but it doesn\\u2019t actually match what my backyard looks like in real life. I can usually see to the other side of the stream a hill which I could go up and over. But this time is the cliff face on the far side and the water. There\\u2019s some sort of activity happening. There are a bunch of nice lawn chairs like you\\u2019d have for an event. They\\u2019re all set up on the lawn. I am looking through a pair of binoculars. My brothers are sitting in some of the chairs and my binoculars are rating them. My brothers are suddenly younger in age. The binoculars are like, \\u201cThis one is single and he plays sports, he\\u2019s a forward.\\u201d I look at the next one and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis one is too young for consideration.\\u201d Then I look at another one and the binoculars say something rude like, \\u201cNot cute.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow fuck you rude binoculars.\\u201d They don\\u2019t actually say things; they\\u2019re printing words at the bottom of my vision. It\\u2019s so strange and I don\\u2019t know why my brothers are being rated. There are two other guys. I don\\u2019t recognize them, but they\\u2019re youngish and fit within my brothers\\u2019 ages. They have what looks like soccer shin pads that I\\u2019ve made for them. They need them but I don\\u2019t know why. I\\u2019m sewing the shin pads into the box and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this because they\\u2019re going to need them eventually. I\\u2019m very meticulous, one tiny stitch at a time, sewing them into a cardboard box and plastic frame. All of a sudden I realize they\\u2019re going to need to wear these so why am I doing this because they won\\u2019t be able to get them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere are your shin pads. You\\u2019ll need them when you need them.\\u201d One of them asks me how to make the shin pads tight on their legs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s velcro, you just tighten it.\\u201d One of them is like, \\u201cNo, you might have to sew them onto me.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cI could sew through your skin but that would be weird.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, that might happen.\\u201d I\\u2019m confused internally. Part of me thinks that makes total sense and I might need to sew them onto their skin and it\\u2019s like a right of passage and that\\u2019s how I know they\\u2019re warriors. But the other part of my brain is like, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t sew skin.\\u201d Then the dream changes a little bit. I decide to go to the pool. I did not grow up with a pool so this is definitely out of my regular childhood home reality. I wade into the pool. It\\u2019s a huge rectangular pool, enclosed with glass windows on one side and some light coming in. There are double doors that look like the same doors on the sunporch. It\\u2019s like a boat ramp that you walk down and it slowly gets deeper and deeper. So I\\u2019m in the pool and at the far end where there is less light and a lot darker, there\\u2019s a room off to the left. Part of the room is underwater. Somebody opens the doors to this room. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I know that they\\u2019re not supposed to open those doors. Sure enough, this creature comes out of those doors. I\\u2019m scared. I don\\u2019t recall what the creature looks like. It\\u2019s coming into the main pool. I have swum out to where I can\\u2019t touch and now I\\u2019m swimming back to where I can get out of the water. I remember tentacles so maybe it was part octopus, but I\\u2019m not sure.\"],[\"\\u201cScavengers\\u201d The most meaningful picture from my dream is that everything was burnt. It was like a post after the fire burning of the world. Yet even though there was cooled lava stone kind of shell overtop everything that was alive, there were still some people left. So some people had survived. And some people had scavenged stuff from the rubble or had hammered the crust with something and broken off a piece of some piece of junk - like an item you\\u2019d normally buy in a store, that kind of junk - and had scrabbled a living from this. The people that had done that were emaciated and skinny like skeletons with vacant eyes. Their whole focus was on what they had scavenged and made into a business to sell. They weren\\u2019t chasing me and I wasn\\u2019t running from them. Because I was uninterested in their scavenged things, it was like they didn\\u2019t even notice I was there. So I was able to be invisible. At one point in the dream, one of them looked at me and I still remember that hollow kind of hungry gaze and it pierced me for a second, and then I think because I didn\\u2019t return it, I didn\\u2019t need it - I didn\\u2019t need anything it had, its hunger just retracted and then it was as though I was insignificant and it left me alone. They were quite frightening to look at, so was what they had - it was like things you get from the dump, but there were people that were buying it and it was so awful.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Golden Eagle\\u201d As is typical with all of my dreams, there are events that lead up to this one and continue on after. But I feel that this is the significant part of the dream: The setting is an outdoor space. It\\u2019s not a cultivated space; it\\u2019s more of a wild space. And there\\u2019s a gathering of people there - it\\u2019s a large gathering of people. It carries the frequency of a marketplace, but not a marketplace like we have today, probably more of one that would have been hundreds of years ago, pre-capitalism. There\\u2019s some people that have brought things with them to this gathering that they have created themselves, and there are other people that are there simply because it\\u2019s a gathering. There\\u2019s some people there that have never gathered there before and there\\u2019s some people that really feel like not only have they gathered there before, but direct generations of their family have gathered there before. So, I\\u2019m part of this. At the gathering, I\\u2019m alone though. I\\u2019m not part of the bigger groups of people that have come together and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m alone. The dream does not tell me. I\\u2019m standing there, just kind of absorbing the flavors and textures and frequency of the gathering when I open my eyes and see that there is a bird in the sky. The bird is flying and I\\u2019m looking at it, as the bird gets closer I identify it as an eagle, and then as it gets closer I notice the colors of its feathers and realize that it\\u2019s a golden eagle. At the same time that I\\u2019m noticing this, it is flying toward me at a rapid speed and I don\\u2019t really have time to process this in my dream. But I suddenly realize that as it gets closer and closer, it\\u2019s going to land on my head and then it does. I feel there was a moment of fear and then it was quickly dissipated by the feeling that it was not going to hurt me at all, but it landed on my head and I knew it was coming for me. As it lands on my head, I can feel my neck is almost buckling under the weight of it. The size of its feet were the size of my skull. I can feel the hard leathery feel of its toes - its digits. And I can feel a click of the smooth really hard texture of its talons. I can feel them on the sides of my skull and around the back, but they\\u2019re not squishing me - they\\u2019re not squeezing me. I know they have the power to, but they\\u2019re not. I can just feel their weight and texture. The bird\\u2019s front body is facing my back, so its tail feathers and the ends of its wings are around my face and shoulders. I can\\u2019t see anything now. It almost feels like a headdress. The bird bent over with its upper body and neck so I could feel its beak touch that big knuckle at the base of my cervical spine - the larger one, T3 - I feel its beak there. And while this is happening I can hear other people\\u2019s voices. When it first started getting closer I could hear other people saying, \\u201cHah! It\\u2019s a golden eagle!\\u201d like they\\u2019re all excited. And then some people were like: \\u201cLa, what\\u2019s it doing?!\\u201d And then when it landed on my head, I don\\u2019t remember anybody saying anything. So it must have been kind of quiet. And then it feels like the bird\\u2019s not talking to me, it\\u2019s not speaking English, but it feels like it relayed some kind of message and I don\\u2019t know what it is (in the dream I knew what it was), but I could not remember it when I woke up. And then the bird left. I remember I was feeling sad. I was already isolated when I was there, and I felt more sad when the bird left. Then I wake up, but I'm still in my dream. I wake up in my dream and have another dream. Then that dream returns to me, but time has passed. It\\u2019s been many gatherings in the same place later. This time I know the bird is coming. I sit down. I span my skirt out around me - it\\u2019s a long skirt. I\\u2019m in a comfortable position and I\\u2019m closing my eyes and I feel its approach more than see it. Instead of landing on my head this time, it lands on something beside me - something raised - I don\\u2019t know what it was - maybe it was just a stump or rock. It allows me to touch it this time. I do and I arrange its tail feathers. I just smooth that it\\u2019s gigantic - the size of my whole torso and head. And it\\u2019s more like a communion this time. It spends some time with me. It gets up and I know (not through English) that it\\u2019s telling me to follow it, so I do. It goes to the outskirts of this gathering to a higher tree. I just stand there in front of it and it sits there. I feel like it\\u2019s passing some kind of symbolic message to me and telling me that there are other people in this gathering that will understand it. And then I actually leave it - it doesn\\u2019t fly away - and go back into the market. It feels like there\\u2019s a frequency in the market, like a template that\\u2019s invisible, like a web, and it\\u2019s lifted and separate from the rest of the cacophony of bustle. I follow it and it leads me to someone that I know - I met her at a teacher training and we became instant friends; she moved after the training was over but we still keep in touch, but it was one of those instant things. She\\u2019s there and she\\u2019s been making these amulets and each one carries a symbol and she\\u2019s explaining to me what they are and I realize that the eagle has told me to seek her out. Then I wake up, that\\u2019s the end of my dream.\"],[\"The setting is the restaurant where I worked in university. It\\u2019s a busy restaurant in a mall and they\\u2019ve changed our uniforms over again, which they used to do twice a year. Sometimes the shirts were horrible, but the bottoms were always black jeans. Only this time instead of just changing our shirts, we had to wear tights. I hated it. They showed everything - they were not even the good kind of yoga pants, they were like cheap knock offs that didn\\u2019t even hold their shape. Not only did they show everything, but they were baggy, too. I really didn\\u2019t want to wear them. I don\\u2019t know how I got away with it. I was still wearing my black jeans and other servers were starting to wear these tights. I had a whole bunch of stuff in my backpack and I put it in the office for safekeeping - not really sure why I did that, but we did have a problem with theft. Anyway, I had a bunch of my stuff in the office and they were stupid things, too - plastic knick knacks like McDonald\\u2019s toys and I had them in a plastic container, like tupperware. When I finished my shift, they were still there and I was trying to put them in my apron and there were too many of them and I was losing track. Then when I went to leave the restaurant at the end of my shift, the good owner (not the shyster one) and two of the other staff, we needed to fix something for someone\\u2019s car so that they could actually leave. And so we walked over to this other store in the mall to assist the staff member with communicating what it was that needed to be fixed. It was like a diode or something that needed to be replaced - it was this little tiny part in this series of bigger complicated parts. So we waited there with her while the part was being replaced. Oh my god, it just went on and on and on, and the person that was supposed to be fixing it kept talking to other people and chatting. And I\\u2019m like oh, I have to get out of here and why is this taking so long. And I just got really agitated and frustrated when we were there. Finally the store employee went over and flipped one switch and it recharged her diode and then we went out and we popped it under the hood of her car, and she was off. I said goodbye to the other two people and then I was walking across the parking lot with the remaining person (I know her in real life) and she was telling me that she knows she\\u2019s going to end up alone one day. And I was like: \\u201cReally? I\\u2019m shocked!\\u201d (because in real life she has a husband and two kids and they\\u2019re a beautiful family unit). And she said: \\u201cYep, my husband is either all in or all out, and I\\u2019ve just always known that one day he\\u2019s going to be gone.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be okay with that?\\u201d And she said she is. And then I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand how people can just shut off their emotions like that.\\u201d I told her about what it felt like when Omar died and said it was (and I did the math in my head in my dreams)...I said I was 28, so that was 30, no 22 years ago, and I still think about him every day. He\\u2019s never gone out of my heart, and I just don\\u2019t understand loving somebody and then just not loving them. When you love someone, they\\u2019re always a part of you. And then of course, I woke up because the emotion from that is still really strong.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Grid\\u201d In my dream last night, I\\u2019m a time traveler. The framework of the dream is set up on a grid system. I have lived in Toronto, Ontario, but I don\\u2019t live there now (for a short period of time I was there) and it\\u2019s a very easy city to get to know if you spend some time on the grid, which is a north-south-east-west system. In the dream, if you stop at a washroom or go down into the subway, you end up in a different time zone when you come out. So the whole dream is me trying to gather people together so that we\\u2019re all going into these wormholes at the same time so we don\\u2019t lose each other. The interesting thing is I keep waking up out of this dream and then going back to sleep and simply picking up where it left off. But every time I go back to sleep. I\\u2019m trying to regather the people that I was with before I woke up. The dream starts and I\\u2019m with my own family and one of the places in the grid is a restaurant, but it\\u2019s one of the older kinds of restaurants where the upstairs also has sleeping rooms for travelers. Not all of the people in that time zone are good people, so I\\u2019m warning my daughter to stay away from one of these girls because I can just tell by the look of her that she\\u2019s a thief and a prostitute. She\\u2019s sizing us up and I know if we don\\u2019t keep our money and valuables safe, she will steal from us. I\\u2019m trying to get the door of the restaurant locked because the prostitute has gone off with Omar and I don\\u2019t want her to come back in because I don\\u2019t want her to follow us through the next wormhole. So I do manage to keep the door locked and the prostitute comes out an hour later from the doorway and she has only her underwear on and her bra and she\\u2019s saying she\\u2019s desperately trying to get in and I know this is part of the trick because I can tell by her face that she\\u2019s not really upset. And I just know this. I do manage to succeed in convincing them to keep the door locked. Then I see her coming out of a different doorway about five minutes later. She gets up and she\\u2019s fully dressed and I can see in her hand that she has two different wallets, so she managed to get them from someone else, but not us. So this is going to sound funny, but it\\u2019s winter in the dream on the grid, and I\\u2019ve got my kids\\u2019 things to carry plus some supplies - food and an extra change of clothes. And my daughter is pushing me around in a shopping cart - she keeps telling me to get in with my stuff and it\\u2019s hard to push it because it\\u2019s a shopping cart and the snow keeps building up on the wheels. So we\\u2019re putting the heavy things in there and I\\u2019m having a hard time pushing it and my daughter keeps wanting me to get in there and rest, and she is pushing me around so we look like homeless people. We go into this other portal and come out on the other side and it\\u2019s a party. It\\u2019s packed with people and there are people that I know. So, one of these couples that I know are people that I know from the Sail Club, and I realize that the man is screwing around on the woman and I think, \\u201cOh no, that\\u2019s horrible!\\u201d And I wrestle with the idea of telling her. And I don\\u2019t yet because it\\u2019s a really tough decision to make and is it any of my business, and what effects of that decision will it have on others. So while I\\u2019m wrestling with that decision, I realize that she is actually aware of it and just doesn\\u2019t appear to either care or acknowledge it, so I don\\u2019t tell her. In the same scene, there\\u2019s another little girl and she\\u2019s being shadowed by a teenage girl. So the first girl is 8 and the other is maybe 16. They go into the showers and I\\u2019m standing there because I\\u2019m on this other girl because of the shadowing. So they both get into the same shower and I\\u2019m thinking this isn\\u2019t right. And then I walk in and look and they are showering together and they are undressed. I step in and open the door and I ask the younger girl, \\u201cAre you alright?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t answer me. So I glare at the other one and fierce her down and take the younger girl and put some clothes on her because her clothes have disappeared, so I\\u2019m just taking some various things and covering her up with them. I say, \\u201cIs this yours? Is this yours?\\u201d and people say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not mine,\\u201d and so I put a various eclectic wardrobe on her. And then I\\u2019m wandering around the party with her in my hand asking anyone if they know who this girl is because she doesn\\u2019t talk. People will say, \\u201cOh, I saw her with so and so,\\u201d and then the so and so won\\u2019t be there and there\\u2019s different so and so\\u2019s every time and I can\\u2019t find who this girl belongs to. But then I\\u2019m starting to get concerned that I\\u2019m getting sucked into or overly involved with the dynamics of the people at this party and I\\u2019m afraid that I will forget that I\\u2019m a time traveler and that I\\u2019ll lose my time traveler family, so I start to gather up the people that I came with - my daughter, some other nameless people who are just there, they are part of my travel group - and I\\u2019m looking for someone now. I say I need someone to take care of her for me, and this couple - the oblivious woman and the man who is screwing around on her all the time - say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take her. We\\u2019ll love her. We love everybody.\\u201d In the dream I\\u2019m not concerned that she\\u2019ll be sexually abused. I know that they are going to take care of her. They\\u2019re good people, they just have this other weird cake. And so I leave her with them and get back into the shopping cart outside of the door and we go down and I\\u2019m starting to recognize streets. I\\u2019m starting to look a lot more closely at the grid because I want to plan where we\\u2019re going and not just go into any door and be more conscious of the grid. I\\u2019m starting to feel more textures in the dream. So as I climb back in the cart, I\\u2019m feeling that the front handle of it is actually cold and it\\u2019s plastic feeling and the metal of the cart is even colder and I\\u2019m trying to pull the sleeve of my coat down over my hand so it won\\u2019t stick to it. It\\u2019s actually not that comfortable riding in it because the wheels keep getting stuck and it\\u2019s bumpy. But this is what she wants to do and I let her. We have some conversations. She\\u2019s still bothered by locking the prostitute out of the first scene, and I tell her that regardless of what we did she would still steal everyone\\u2019s wallets and she would still make the same choices and it\\u2019s not our purpose to try and change people\\u2019s choices here, but to learn the grid and to find our way through it. So I\\u2019m starting to read the signs and I\\u2019m recognizing where we are - what starts to become a sense of direction in the grid. My daughter keeps steering the cart. Now I don\\u2019t know where my consciousness goes during this - maybe I go to sleep in the dream and I wake up. Instead of staying on the grid we\\u2019ve gone off to side grid things and we\\u2019re in smaller parts because she likes them better because they are closer together and more intimate, but they don\\u2019t have any identifying characteristics. So it\\u2019s a lot harder for me to find the main patterns of the grid when she does this, but we do. So the second time I dive in and dive out, it\\u2019s me finding our way out of this non-identifiable part onto more of the main grid. And then we come to a wormhole that I know we\\u2019re supposed to go into and I don\\u2019t want to go in, so I linger outside of it. Now it\\u2019s just my daughter and I. Because she went off the grid, we lost the other people we were supposed to be traveling with. I\\u2019m hoping that by staying on the grid, we\\u2019ll find them the next time we pop up somewhere. I also think that maybe if we wait, they might pop up out of this wormhole because I think they\\u2019re going to be looking for us. So while we\\u2019re waiting around this one crossroads, I talk or make a connection with an older man. At first he\\u2019s just an older man. We just have a conversation about some kind of philosophy or something. I\\u2019m not really paying much attention to the conversation. Then we decide to go down into the wormhole and we do, and we\\u2019re staying together and I\\u2019m giving her instructions, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta make sure we don\\u2019t get separated. Don\\u2019t go off onto any areas without telling me.\\u201d We pop up successfully and I see the rest of the people that we\\u2019re supposed to be with and we rush and we connect back with them. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember exactly what they said, but they\\u2019re telling us what happened during their wormhole experience. The interesting thing about this as the dream is starting to come to a close is that together we find the next wormhole that we\\u2019re supposed to dive into, but people keep needing to go to the washroom. But I\\u2019m telling them they can\\u2019t do this because each washroom is a wormhole and we\\u2019re supposed to stay together. Some of them decide to do it anyway and I know that here we go again, we\\u2019re going to get sidetracked from our purpose. Well, we keep trying to find each other. And then I see this old man again and he\\u2019s standing up - he\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am. Now as I start talking to him I\\u2019m not just seeing him for what his profession is with small talk, but I start to feel beyond the surface of his skin into the character and kind of being he is, and he\\u2019s just so beautiful on the inside. My being feels his being. I tell him that once I go down into the wormhole, I won\\u2019t ever see him again. And he says, \\u201cyes, I know.\\u201d And then we just start to hug, but it\\u2019s the kind of hug where you just kind of fall into the other person - it\\u2019s not a squeezy hug, it\\u2019s just so enveloping and I just stand there. It seems like five minutes go by and I\\u2019m so comforted by this hug. And I realize as we\\u2019re doing this that we also need to not get so preoccupied with staying on the grid, that we\\u2019re missing the connections with the people that are in between wormholes. And then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Mission\\u201d In this dream I am aware that there are other beings in the world that we live in. They don\\u2019t have a body or faces. We can\\u2019t see them, I don\\u2019t know what they look like but I do know they are there. They reveal other parts of the dimensions that we live in when the right people are gathered together. Some of the people are oblivious to the fact that they\\u2019re supposed to gather together and others are not. So the dream flips between scenes where people are gathering. There\\u2019s always one person that is aware that the gathering has occurred. In each house where this happens, the curtains are supposed to stay slightly open, and when everyone has arrived, the curtains are closed. And then some other kind of message will come through, left by these other beings. It changes every time. You have to look for it, too. For example, one of them was actually underneath a flyer on a telephone pole. I was looking for the message and kept expanding the search area outside of the house to wider areas until I thought, \\u201cThe messages are never this far away from the actual home.\\u201d So I retraced my steps and went back and found it underneath the flyer. There\\u2019s some violence in it that I can\\u2019t just speak of. What I came away with from this dream is that there\\u2019s a frequency layer on the planet where people just don\\u2019t care about the lives of other beings - whether animals, peoples or plants - they are just completely removed from the heartbeats that make things live. The other thing is that when the right people are gathered, you can evolve through that and you move past it. Not past the violence, but past the frequency that\\u2019s your everyday existence. But if you lived in isolation and didn't come together in groups, none of these fantastical conversations would happen when you discover something new. The layer of other dimensional beings remained with me when I woke up and I couldn't go back to sleep - it was that other layer of detachment and being observed that I really didn\\u2019t like.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cake\\u201d I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I tell him that sure, I\\u2019ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn\\u2019t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it\\u2019s run by a temperamental chef. There\\u2019s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I\\u2019m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they\\u2019re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they\\u2019re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they\\u2019re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I\\u2019m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I\\u2019m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there\\u2019s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there\\u2019s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover\\u2019s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She\\u2019s about 10. And she\\u2019s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn\\u2019t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she\\u2019s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn\\u2019t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn\\u2019t upset about it. He\\u2019s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he\\u2019s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn\\u2019t address the cake. Now we\\u2019re in a car and we\\u2019re driving up this beautiful roadway - it\\u2019s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there\\u2019s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in when you\\u2019re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It\\u2019s a perfect day and there\\u2019s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it\\u2019s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cPhotographs\\u201d The setting is somewhere I\\u2019ve never been before. I don\\u2019t recognize it. The population is a higher density than I\\u2019ve lived anywhere in Canada. I\\u2019ve never lived anywhere else other than here, so I'm not sure. The architecture I\\u2019m positive is much older than contemporary. It\\u2019s not made of stone though, so it\\u2019s not Medieval, it\\u2019s not Renaissance. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Northern European either. I\\u2019m feeling it\\u2019s more Mediterranean or something closer to the Equator, though it\\u2019s not as hot climate wise. It\\u2019s very colorful. There\\u2019s a lot of curves to the architecture and extra pieces added on, too, and it\\u2019s not just a box structure. There\\u2019s artistic pieces added on so it looks pleasing to the eye. It\\u2019s very artsy in this community. People make everything by hand. There\\u2019s a lot of thought put into it first. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be hierarchy of economy either or social standing. So what you eat, what you wear and your craft are all socially equal. So when you go to have food, you pick each item from the person who has created it. Then you create your food together. You can also go to a cook who is making food for others. You don\\u2019t just go in there, order at a counter and buy it. You have a conversation and then the cook shares a dish with you that he/she/they think you would like. So it\\u2019s quite different and very beautiful. I am a representative of life. In my dream I\\u2019m not called a photographer. I don\\u2019t actually have a camera. I have something that takes shadows so it\\u2019s a light. There\\u2019s a background and then once the light is shined on the object or person, it\\u2019s the outline that represents who they are. I make these for people. So they\\u2019ll come in and have a conversation with me and when I think it\\u2019s time, I\\u2019ll shine the light (with their permission, that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re there for, it\\u2019s not uninvited) and create a shadow for them. Lots of times this is done in exchange for foods or other gifts. This is a barter system economy. I\\u2019m very happy there. The dream comes to a conclusion in two ways. There seems to be a theme in my dreams lately where they\\u2019re both/and. Things are happening at the same time. So at the same time as I am creating a shadow piece for myself, I am also in the place where the person who cooks for other people is cooking. I\\u2019m in there just sitting. I\\u2019m actually studying some of my own work. The cook is androgynous. That seems to be another theme. I\\u2019m talking to them just in little bits. It\\u2019s a very comfortable conversation - the way you would have a conversation with someone you lived with for a long period of time where you say a couple of sentences and they respond and you\\u2019re both kind of doing your own thing. Fifteen minutes go by and then you make another couple remarks. It\\u2019s like that. So I\\u2019m in there and I\\u2019m aware that there\\u2019s a man that comes in. He\\u2019s trying to order a sandwich the way we would here now. The cook is not responding to him. So I\\u2019m aware that this exchange is unsuccessfully occuring in the sidelines of my consciousness. It gets to a point where I\\u2019m uncomfortable continuing to do what I\\u2019m doing there because this is disruptive. I\\u2019m aware that the cook is agitated. I\\u2019m aware also that the man is not going to go away. I feel compassion and want to stand in to alleviate the discomfort. So I go behind where the food is prepared. I start talking to the cook in the way I would talk to the cook before I was offered something to eat, hoping that by modeling the behavior, the man is going to understand. He doesn\\u2019t. Instead he thinks that I\\u2019m another employee. He starts trying to get me to make the sandwich. I don\\u2019t. But the cook responds to me and gives me a couple slices of tomato. So I go get a plate and put the tomato slices on a plate and bring it over to where I had been doing my own work. He looks puzzled at first and then a little bit angry. I assume that he\\u2019s been thinking, \\u201cWow, I\\u2019ve been standing here asking for something for x number of minutes, and she just walks in there and starts helping herself and gets service.\\u201d And then he reaches over as though he\\u2019s going to help himself, and then someone else materializes on the scene and grabs his arm and removes it. There\\u2019s a commotion. The man is eventually removed because he won\\u2019t listen and he won\\u2019t start trying to force a sandwich because none is appearing. I realize that I\\u2019m describing this, my consciousness is flipping back and forth from this scene through the portal of my work that I\\u2019m trying to focus on. In my own work, I am adjusting my own posture so I can get the line of the shadow that I want through this piece. The piece is created by wearing a sarong just between your navel and your hips. It\\u2019s not a flowy sarong, it\\u2019s more like the ones you see in Egyptian photos where the material is thicker and the piece that hangs over the front is wide - it\\u2019s not flowy, it\\u2019s made of a stiffer fabric. On the top fabric goes around the ribcage up to the nipples, so they start at the bottom rib - the material is stiffer - and they go up towards the nipples. What keeps happening is every time I adjust this piece of fabric over my own body, it goes over top of my nipples and I\\u2019m trying to get it to say just below the line of the nipples so you see the actual line of the nipples in the outline and then it goes down the rest of the body. Also in my dream, my physical body is getting really turned on by this. Every time it happens in my dream, I find it hard to stay in the dream. So the moment I get this right. There it is! The shadow is exactly the way I want it to look and feel, it\\u2019s just like Boom! My whole body is electrified. That\\u2019s the end of the dream. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cash\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town and I\\u2019m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They\\u2019re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I\\u2019m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it\\u2019s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there\\u2019s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they\\u2019re not making any sound, so I\\u2019m suspecting that it\\u2019s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don\\u2019t have that much money yet. I\\u2019m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don\\u2019t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I\\u2019m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I\\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table. They\\u2019ve wandered off now and I\\u2019m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I\\u2019m sensing another presence there that I can\\u2019t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what\\u2019s wrong with my car. He\\u2019s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic\\u2019s and I tell them exactly what\\u2019s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don\\u2019t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I\\u2019ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, \\u201cYay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.\\u201d And they\\u2019re saying, \\u201cOh wow, that\\u2019s fantastic.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn\\u2019t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.\\u201d So I\\u2019m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I\\u2019m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar\\u2019s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he\\u2019s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I\\u2019ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, \\u201cOh, what was wrong with it?\\u201d And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I\\u2019m cautious as Mike asks me what\\u2019s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, \\u201cOh? How did you know to say that?\\u201d because he knows even though I\\u2019m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don\\u2019t know the exact language to call the parts. And he\\u2019s looking at me. And I\\u2019m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I\\u2019m thinking is that I don\\u2019t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he\\u2019s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we\\u2019re in shifts and changes and we\\u2019re sitting in his mom\\u2019s actual house on the couch in the living room. There\\u2019s a picture of Omar on the end table. I\\u2019ve got my one arm around the back of Mike\\u2019s shoulders soothing him. I\\u2019m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, \\u201cOmar told you, didn\\u2019t he?\\u201d and I said, \\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d And then I say to him: \\u201care you okay?\\u201d And he puts his head down and it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom\\u2019s house are gone. We\\u2019re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we\\u2019re in it. Omar\\u2019s at the wheel and he\\u2019s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He\\u2019s tapping the gas pedal and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201chmm well this is good.\\u201d I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, \\u201cyeah and look how much cash I\\u2019ve got left over.\\u201d He laughs. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that extra cash?\\u201d And I know what I\\u2019m going to do with it, but I haven\\u2019t told anyone. So we\\u2019re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it\\u2019s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we\\u2019re driving down Colburn for a block and now it\\u2019s the year it would be now. I\\u2019m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an ice cream store over there. That\\u2019s new. There\\u2019s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there\\u2019s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn\\u2019t changed.\\u201d Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing? Now we\\u2019re back on Kent St.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.\\u201d He looks at me and we\\u2019re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I\\u2019ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing here?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I\\u2019ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.\\u201d I give it to him and I say, \\u201cGo buy a guitar. Just do it!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d So we go into the store and we\\u2019re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, \\u201cOh what one are you interested in?\\u201d Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, \\u201cWell, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn\\u2019t have the pickup and it\\u2019s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.\\u201d So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.\\u201d (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYes!\\u201d And he says, \\u201cDone!\\u201d So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they\\u2019re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that\\u2019s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there\\u2019s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There\\u2019s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There\\u2019s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it\\u2019s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he\\u2019s doing. It looks like he\\u2019s making chocolate chip cookies. He\\u2019s got the dough rolled out and there\\u2019s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, \\u201cWhat the hell?!\\u201d I walk up and I\\u2019m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they\\u2019re not even chocolate chips. They\\u2019re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I\\u2019m thinking, oh my god, that\\u2019s gross, but I\\u2019m fascinated that he\\u2019s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: \\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\\u201d and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they\\u2019ve already gone out of that room and I know they\\u2019re going down a hall and there\\u2019s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There\\u2019s no tools in front of him and no table. He\\u2019s faking working. I realize that he\\u2019s eavesdropping, he\\u2019s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my dream?! You\\u2019ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.\\u201d He starts telling me that he\\u2019s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It\\u2019s bullshit what he\\u2019s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don\\u2019t want to lose them and I certainly don\\u2019t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it\\u2019s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He\\u2019s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like \\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, \\u201cThis is Errant, my ex-husband.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cThis is Omar.\\u201d As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar\\u2019s hand, I realize that there\\u2019s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant\\u2019s going to be mad about this and he\\u2019s going to pound it out into me because he\\u2019s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I\\u2019m like I can\\u2019t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don\\u2019t want that handshake to join. Errant says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad,\\u201d as though he knows Omar\\u2019s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, \\u201cFor fucks sake! He knows that and he\\u2019s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He\\u2019s inserting himself here and of course, Omar\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh thanks very much.\\u201d He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, \\u201cOh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.\\u201d I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I\\u2019m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there\\u2019s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I\\u2019m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he\\u2019s a jerk, don\\u2019t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I\\u2019m still so agitated I can\\u2019t calm myself down in the dream. I\\u2019m feeling both threatened that Errant\\u2019s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I\\u2019m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I\\u2019m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won\\u2019t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I\\u2019m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.\"],[\"\\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go\\u201d / \\u201cDreams and Heartache\\u201d The setting in this dream is a campground where people would go with their RVs. There\\u2019s water and electricity on each camp, and huts where they have table tennis and ping pong, a nice shower, the washing machine and dryer and stuff like that. So I\\u2019m in the campground in an RV - it\\u2019s mine - and I\\u2019m sitting in a chair watching the sunset and this really good looking guy comes up and asks if he can join me. So I say yes and he sits down in the chair beside me. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and there\\u2019s some chemistry. He asks if he could see me again and if I would like to share dinner with him the next night and I say yes. So instantly it\\u2019s the next night and he\\u2019s brought dinner over. It\\u2019s a box of triscuit crackers. I can\\u2019t even eat wheat and in the dream I don\\u2019t ask if they\\u2019re gluten-free, but I look at what he\\u2019s brough and think, hmm this was not quite my idea of dinner. I excuse myself and say just a moment. I\\u2019ve gone back into my RV to get plates, knives and forks. I put a plate, knife and fork in front of each of us. He pours the crackers onto the plate and he pours two on each plate. I\\u2019m thinking to myself, wow, there isn\\u2019t even anything to go on top of the crackers. So he cuts his into 4 pieces, each cracker into 4 pieces. He asks me if I would like him to cut my food. He\\u2019s being chivalrous and galant about it. I accept his offer, but say I would like mine cut into 5 pieces please. I think this is funny because the triscuits won\\u2019t cut nicely into five pieces. They\\u2019re breaking and crumbling. He\\u2019s trying to cut mine into 5 pieces and I\\u2019m giggling under my breath. As he is struggling with this, I have a journal and pen in front of me. I\\u2019m writing a song called, \\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go.\\u201d It\\u2019s got song lyrics to rhyme and I think these are terribly clever. I\\u2019m using a tune to a popular rock song and am humming along as I do it. In the next part of the dream, the good looking guy is still struggling with the crackers. I walk across the RV park to the laundromat and I see my ex husband, Errant, and my son, and they\\u2019re talking to each other and preparing some food - now the laundromat also has a kitchen. I sit down in the chair waiting for them to finish what they\\u2019re doing. Errant sits down beside me, leans in and asks me what I dreamt about the night before. I start telling him - I get two sentences in and he gets up as if I wasn\\u2019t even saying anything and just walks off. He\\u2019s gone back to the kitchen. So I just sit in the chair feeling heartache. I get up out of my chair and walk into the kitchen where they are. Then my son asks me what I dreamt about and I start telling him. He would normally sit down and listen or exchange his own, and he does the exact same thing that Errant just did - listens for one sentence as though I didn\\u2019t say anything and leaves and goes upstairs. I sit back down in the chair feeling that I should not have exposed my son to Errant because he\\u2019s picking up his bad behaviors. I worry about that - how he will treat another partner in the future.\"],[\"\\u201cBoundaries and Brats\\u201d This dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019ve had lots of dreams set in this house. It\\u2019s long and narrow, although the rooms are plenty big enough - they\\u2019re just longer than they are wide. There're houses in New Orleans called shotgun houses because they\\u2019re long like that and the entrance to all the rooms are off the hallway, so if you\\u2019re driving by and shooting a gun, you could shoot a bullet in the front door and it goes all the way through the house and out the backdoor. So I guess it\\u2019s a shotgun house. We\\u2019re in the very back room of this house, which is my bedroom. We\\u2019re having a house discussion, so all the people that live there are having a conversation about pets. We have lots and I love pets. But one of them has a cow and I don\\u2019t want it lying on my bed because it runs around outside and in the backyard, too, where there\\u2019s poops lying around on the grass, so it\\u2019s got poops on its feet or it could have at any given time. I don\\u2019t want that on my bed. So I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cAnimals, if they can be trained to stay on the floor, then that\\u2019s fine, they\\u2019re allowed in my room. But if they\\u2019re up on my bed, then I won\\u2019t also allow them in my room.\\u201d The cow is in the room while we\\u2019re saying this. As I\\u2019m talking, it\\u2019s doing this sad eyes and pouty mouth. First it puts its head in my lap and looks sad, then it rolls a little bit at a time, like a toddler does when they\\u2019re limp and you\\u2019re trying to get them to walk and they just turn into a blob. It\\u2019s doing this. Then it\\u2019s on the bed. So I push it off and it\\u2019s heavy - it\\u2019s got a great big belly and it\\u2019s bigger than I am and it\\u2019s head is the size of my torso. But I push it back onto the floor and it looks at me mournfully. But I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, get off my bed.\\u201d But the people I\\u2019m having this discussion with don\\u2019t even hear me. And they say, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s alright if the cow is on your bed as long as your bed is made and the quilt is on.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo! I just finished saying, not on my bed under any circumstances!\\u201d Then the dream instantaneously is full of people and one of the roommates is having a birthday party for an 8-10 year old kid. So it feels like there\\u2019s hundreds of these kids around and they start opening my drawers and pulling out my shirts. One of them has a pair of scissors and they\\u2019re making costumes to dress up with. She starts to cut up one of my shirts and use the pieces of it for something else. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not allowed to do that, get out of my dresser. Close the drawer.\\u201d She looks at me and rolls her eyes like that 13 year old girl way - make a face. Then she leaves, but I see her looking back as she\\u2019s leaving and I intuit that she\\u2019s just waiting until I\\u2019m out of my room and she\\u2019s going to come back in anyway. So I put my clothes that they\\u2019ve taken out back in the dresser drawers. So there\\u2019s nothing on the floor and my room is back intact again. I close the door. I go through this crowd of kids to look for the roommate who is responsible for them. This person has no defining features, I can\\u2019t tell if they\\u2019re a man or woman, they\\u2019re just a roommate. I say to the roommate, \\u201cYou need to tell these kids that they\\u2019re not allowed in my room.\\u201d They\\u2019re like a phantom. I don\\u2019t really get a response from them and I realize it\\u2019s my responsibility to keep these kids out of my room. So I turn around and I see my bedroom door is open. So I go back in. This time I\\u2019m angry and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI told you guys not to do this and you\\u2019re doing it anyway! I\\u2019m taking your scissors and all this stuff you\\u2019ve made because you\\u2019re not respecting this!\\u201d I kick them out of my room again with these angry words and push them out with my hands. I can feel my hands making contact with them. Now they\\u2019re giving me the angry teenager rolling eyes angry look. So they\\u2019re looking back at me and I\\u2019m standing there like grrrr. I look down the hallway and the roommate is now aware of my displeasure and decides to take them to a movie instead. But it\\u2019s communicated to me that it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re respecting my boundaries or making the kids aware that there are boundaries they need to follow, but that \\u201cOh well Freya is grumpy and terrible so we\\u2019re just going to go somewhere else.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cCommunity\\u201d There\\u2019s a lot of mundane stuff that I won\\u2019t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they\\u2019re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she\\u2019s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re not triggered that you see her.\\u201d And my non-dream psyche answers back, \\u201cNo, hmm, I\\u2019m not.\\u201d But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we\\u2019re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it\\u2019s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We\\u2019re having casual conversations. It\\u2019s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There\\u2019s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He\\u2019s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he\\u2019s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he\\u2019s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it\\u2019s odd. I realize as I\\u2019m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn\\u2019t stand living there - one of the things I\\u2019ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that\\u2019s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there\\u2019s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he\\u2019s gathered all these people together. We\\u2019ve all brought our own food. He\\u2019s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who\\u2019s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property\\u2019s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it\\u2019s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it\\u2019s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. \\u201cOh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!\\u201d \\u201cI can store my snowmobile here!\\u201d \\u201cI can put my motorcycle here!\\u201d \\u201cOh here\\u2019s a big place I can take my dog out to run!\\u201d So it\\u2019s this whole building of community and that\\u2019s what the dream was about.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Wall\\u201d The second dream, I\\u2019m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I\\u2019m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they\\u2019ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won\\u2019t be aware of what they\\u2019ve actually been doing. I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they\\u2019re hiding, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you even hiding that? It\\u2019s just a book.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I\\u2019m still a teenager in it, though, and I\\u2019ve moved out of their house but I\\u2019ve gone back for a visit. There\\u2019s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there\\u2019s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I\\u2019m looking at what she\\u2019s brought out. I see a couple things and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! That was mine! I don\\u2019t remember hiding that and I didn\\u2019t even notice I was missing it.\\u201d So in the dream, we\\u2019re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don\\u2019t know what to do with mine. I guess I don\\u2019t have any pockets. I can\\u2019t seem to think in the dream, \\u201cOh why don\\u2019t I just take them with me?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m encumbered with the idea that the mom can\\u2019t see it and I\\u2019ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, \\u201cMom, Freya\\u2019s been hiding things in the wall.\\u201d Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she\\u2019s really disappointed in me that I\\u2019ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I\\u2019m thinking I don\\u2019t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I\\u2019m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Altar\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m living in a large house - it\\u2019s an older farmhouse and it\\u2019s surrounded by forest. The architecture is intricate and beautiful - almost like a mini castle. In my dream, I do not go in the house. The dream occurs outside the house. Imagine standing on the front porch of that house looking forward and you\\u2019re surrounded by an arc of tables. The middle of the arc extends outwards from the house and the two ends wrap around the outside to where the beam for the house would be. The tables are eclectic - there\\u2019s all different kinds and shapes that create this arc. I am involved with arranging things on the tables. Each table tells its own story and so do the objects on it. The dream begins where I\\u2019ve already set up and created the stories on all tables except this one that I am struggling with to bring into the arc so that it doesn\\u2019t stick out in some unseemly way from the general shape the tables are creating together. I\\u2019m a little frazzled because I can\\u2019t get the table to move. It\\u2019s stuck somehow. I\\u2019m also under some kind of time crunch where I need to meet with someone else, a friend, A.T. We are to go to this other ceremony that\\u2019s a type of reunion. So it\\u2019s time to go and I have to leave the table where it is, standing off like an unabsorbed cell. I meet A.T. and we are dressed for the ceremony. We walk over to it. The ceremony is some kind of presentation of some kind of award, but I never pay attention to it because my interactions are on the outside of that. In the group of people, each one is someone I haven\\u2019t seen in a really long time. We have some conversations. I realize that I am needed back at the arc at this table. I can\\u2019t stay for as many of the conversations as I would like to. So I feel that i\\u2019m unable to be absorbed into the interactions of that crowd at this ceremony as I would like because my duties required back at the house are calling me. As I say my goodbyes I\\u2019m making my way back to the house, I realize that I do need to get this table integrated with the arc of the other tables because once it is, I will be moving onto something else. Again, I\\u2019m struggling with the table and my friend, A.T. is supposed to be with me, but she\\u2019s still lingering back at the other ceremony and I\\u2019m slightly irritated by her tardiness. She\\u2019s supposed to be helping me and here I am waiting for her and now I\\u2019m starting to get anxious that I\\u2019m going to miss the entry into this next realm because she\\u2019s late. But she shows up at the last minute. We still have to get changed. We need to wear different things to move into this other realm. We manage that. I go back into the house and do that. I dash in, change clothes and then come back out. I get the table integrated into the arc and I put some things on it. The items are furry. They speak of a time that is much earlier than the time I\\u2019m in and by placing them on the table, I\\u2019m transported back into the time they came from. My friend does move with me through this portal, but then she goes off to whatever she\\u2019s supposed to be doing here and it\\u2019s not what I am doing. The physical setting here is made of stone - like a stone doorway with a lot of different stones making up a mound and there\\u2019s simply a space between them where I exit out of. There\\u2019s stones along the right hand side of me and I touch them. There\\u2019s kind of thorny things growing up along the other side and wrapping over my head. The brush here is very dense. I\\u2019m following the only path I can as I cannot go off the left because the thorns are too thick. It slopes downwards and I enter into a small clearing and there\\u2019s some other people there. They\\u2019re dressed in furs and they\\u2019ve got skins wrapped around their feet. They\\u2019re aware of me, but they don\\u2019t interact with me. I\\u2019m to set things out on a stone tablet there - some items for them. But we don\\u2019t speak the same language and I can\\u2019t describe to them what I\\u2019m doing, but I sense they\\u2019re waiting for me to do it. In order to achieve that, I need to make contact with someone else. I\\u2019m looking around for him. Then I do suddenly see him and he sees me. I reach out and I make sure that I take his hand slow enough that the other people are aware that we\\u2019ve made contact because that will put them at ease and it will also show them that I have some kind of power. So we do this and I pull him in with me back up the hill to where the clearing was, which is where I entered this realm. We lie down together and embrace. It felt really nice - I remember that feeling. The items we were supposed to lay out on the flat piece of stone - we do that and then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Toothbrush\\u201d In this dream, I am on my way to a concert in Toronto. I\\u2019m with a couple friends - one is a friend of mine, A.G., and the other is my first boyfriend for a little while in high school. We\\u2019ll call him Daren. So in this dream, I\\u2019m with A.G. and Daren. and we\\u2019re on our way to a concert. We stop at his parent\\u2019s place which isn\\u2019t where his parents actually lived. It\\u2019s in a city called Burlington and they\\u2019re living on Plains Rd. The house is really dense on the inside. It\\u2019s like a hoarder house where you can\\u2019t walk through the hallways. You can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on the other end of the hallways. They have all these pets that they\\u2019re constantly looking for because they can\\u2019t find them in all this hoarding mess. So we arrive there and I guess we have to stay overnight. We\\u2019ve arrived late and the concert is the next day in the afternoon, so we\\u2019ve decided to go and sleep there because it\\u2019s closer to leave from his parents\\u2019 place. When we get there, his mom is looking for one of the pets - it\\u2019s this weird amalgamation of a dog and a cat. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog but when I look more closely at it, it has the body of a cat and the neck and head of a dog. We see it for a moment and then it\\u2019s gone again. So all of us are trying to squeeze our way through this house. It seems like in the dream I\\u2019m doing this without any contact from anyone else for what feels like hours. Then I come out into the kitchen and I see Daren and I ask him if he\\u2019s had any luck. He says, \\u201cNot yet, but there\\u2019s this whole other half of the house I haven\\u2019t checked.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say this outloud but I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, this house is so much bigger than it appears to be because of all the stuff.\\u201d So we start off together into the doorway through the other side of the house. It\\u2019s like the air in there is colder - the way it would feel if you were going down in altitude into a cave where it just feels damper and colder, but it still has stuff in it. I can\\u2019t see anything. I see this other creature. It\\u2019s a combination of a hedgehog and a guinea pig. It walks past me and Daren says to me, \\u201cMake sure you don\\u2019t let that guy out.\\u201d I look and suddenly realize there\\u2019s a pocket door I could close, so I do. The little creature stays in there. We get out of this next hallway and his mom and dad are sitting in the next clearing. Daren tells them that he hasn\\u2019t been able to find the dog. Then I look over and I say, \\u201cIs that it?\\u201d It\\u2019s partially masked by some other thing and I can\\u2019t even figure out what this creature is. It\\u2019s black and it has limbs, but there\\u2019s no discernable face on it. Daren says, \\u201cYes that\\u2019s it!\\u201d And he goes over and gets it and picks it up and takes it to his mom. They\\u2019re so happy and patting it. I leave them there and see there\\u2019s a door behind the dad which actually has daylight. I decide to leave out that door, walk all the way around and come in the other door we entered in. It\\u2019s a measure of avoiding all these cluttered passages. So I do that and when I come in, my friend is trying to kiss Daren and I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cThat\\u2019s very strange behavior for her and awkward!\\u201d But he pulls back and walks over. Now I have a cup of tea in my hand and I\\u2019m sitting at a table and I see that his eyes are actually filling up with tears. He\\u2019s upset that she did that. I say, \\u201cWell, why didn\\u2019t you tell her? You should have said something.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ruin this for everyone.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll go over and say something\\u201d He tells me not to for the same reason - it will ruin this event. I\\u2019m sitting with this and thinking that it\\u2019s kind of ruined anyway. It\\u2019s awkward and with no one talking about it, it will just sit there and fester. Then he says, \\u201cAre you ready to go?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat? No! I haven\\u2019t even finished my tea.\\u201d I realize that when I came in, I had a toothbrush and I brushed my teeth in the bathroom. I can\\u2019t figure out how to get through all these hallways with the clutter to go back and check the bathroom. I look through my suitcase which is just a little carry case like a backpack with a whole bunch of zippers. I\\u2019m opening all the zippers and looking in each compartment and it looks like it has my belongings in it, but each zippered compartment is empty. There's no toothbrush and I tell him I don\\u2019t want to leave without brushing my teeth. He does the eye roll thing, \\u201cYou better hurry up, I don\\u2019t want to be late.\\u201d So the rest of the dream I\\u2019m lifting up things and looking underneath them, trying to find my toothbrush.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Well\\u201d Last night I dreamt I was in a garden but the dream didn\\u2019t start in the garden, it started in the city. The city looked like I was walking around in Roman times - it was the architecture. Things were made of stone, there were carvings everywhere. It was very lush, actually, with Mediterranean type plants (not Amazon). As I walked through the city, I was kind of leaving the cosmopolitan area of it and walking to a place that was quiet. In this place, too, I felt like a lot of time had lapsed since I had been there the time before. Things were not the way they were the last time I had seen them. There were stones in the garden that instead of being upright, they were lying down and I couldn\\u2019t see what had been carved on them. I knew that something was carved on them and they\\u2019d all been turned down so that you couldn\\u2019t see what was on them. So I was making my way past them. No one else was there, just me. The plants had grown around them so they\\u2019d been turned down for some time. Eventually I came to a well. This well had stonework built up around it so there was about a 4 foot ledge around the well. I was leaning on it with my forearms and gazing downwards into its darkness. I could hear the sounds of water. I could smell it, too. I just stood there for a little bit with the well. Then I left an offering. I had something in my hand. I left it there. Then I got up and continued to make my way through the garden. But something caused me to turn back. I did and one of the stones shifted - it was a large one. All these stones I\\u2019m describing are at least as tall as a person. When I turned back and looked, I walk toward this stone that was now upright. It\\u2019s Minerva. I sat there beside her for a little bit and wondered what cataclysmic event has caused all the gods and goddesses to be turned away. As I was mulling that through my mind, I was also happy that something had happened that was allowing them to turn back up - to return.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Recital\\u201d This is a really long dream, so I\\u2019m going to summarize some of the parts. It opens up and I\\u2019m at a wedding dance - a wedding celebration where people are dancing. There\\u2019s log tables with people sitting at them and food. The point of this part of it is I\\u2019m surrounded by people I do not want to be surrounded by. I love dancing but i can\\u2019t find anybody I want to dance with. And the people at this wedding are people I don\\u2019t want to share a meal with, so it\\u2019s not very much fun. The scene immediately shifts and I\\u2019m in a farmhouse in a completely different era. I'm participating in making and preserving food. So various people are doing various things. There\\u2019s some people who are actually churning butter. There are people that are milking cows and bringing the milk in pails to the people that are churning the butter. I am aware that there\\u2019s a smokehouse and there\\u2019s people building the fires and curing and smoking meats. It's outside though. Both of these are outside - the smokehouse is further away. Of course the cows are further away than that. The churning butter is closer to the house and I\\u2019m actually in the farmhouse. I\\u2019m in the kitchen. I\\u2019ve been chopping and making what appears to be kimchi which is odd given the historical setting. I\\u2019m putting it all in mason jars and sealing them. I can still smell the aroma of boiling vinegar in my nose. When I finish this, I turn around and Omar is there again. He\\u2019s distanced from me again, so he doesn\\u2019t really know me. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s Omar\\u2019s body but not his spirit in it. He sort of doesn\\u2019t know who I am. He tells me that he\\u2019s been aging Scotch. He tells me what he did with it. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did it work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Then the time speeds up and all of a sudden it\\u2019s today\\u2019s time and I have the two kids that I have. I\\u2019m telling Omar that I have to leave to take my son to his dance lesson. I ask him if he wants to come. He says, no he can\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m disappointed, but I have to go. I leave to go out the farmhouse door. This other guy that used to be a neighborhood thief hops in the car - in the backseat - as I\\u2019m leaving. I end up driving him to Brantford where he gets out and takes off somewhere. So I\\u2019ve picked up both my kids. I\\u2019m taking them to the dance lesson. There\\u2019s been some fiddling around and delays. When I was trying to get in the car, I was trying to get this thief out of it, and I think I\\u2019ve barely made it in time. I think the lesson is an hour, but as it turns out, it\\u2019s only a half hour and as soon as we get there, it\\u2019s over. So I take my kids back into the car and my son\\u2019s dad is in the backseat. He gets out and checks the oil level in the trunk and he\\u2019s spilling it everywhere. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I didn\\u2019t even want you to do that because I\\u2019m in a hurry again. Now why is he here delaying me?\\u201d Then he disappears and I\\u2019m immediately back in the parking lot of hte dance lesson building again. Time just skipped to another day. So I\\u2019m taking my kids back in and we're on time this time. I walk them into the recital hall. My son is acting in it and my daughter is dancing. I\\u2019m sitting up really close to him and I realize that he\\u2019s got different makeup on and he\\u2019s got an elaborate costume. He\\u2019s acting like an old man. He\\u2019s supposed to be chauffeuring another person from the play. I\\u2019m astonished at what a good job he\\u2019s doing with the acting right down to the smallest movements of his body. The rehearsal is finished and both my kids are given parts, none of which they\\u2019ve auditioned for, but they\\u2019re lead roles and neither one of my kids are lead-role people. They accept them graciously. They\\u2019re supposed to walk up onto the stage - each kid has done this - stand there to wait to be bestowed some kind of role and then curtsy and bow and exit out the other side of the stage and come back to their seats. So they\\u2019ve done this. When they get to their seats, they say, \\u201cOh no, Mom, I didn\\u2019t want these and I don\\u2019t want to be the lead role\\u201d and blah blah blah. Then I tell them, \\u201cWell, you should say something.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cNobody ever complains. They just take the roles. We don\\u2019t want to be the first ones to complain.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, if you don't want to do it, speak up. Maybe you could just ask if you can speak to them separately.\\u201d So my daughter approaches the head dance role person and I can\\u2019t hear what they\\u2019re saying, but they\\u2019re speaking. A moment later this head person says that my kids have something to say. They\\u2019ve set up this thing - like a platform. They wheel it onto the stage. It's long and skinny, about 4 feet long and about a foot wide. It\\u2019s on wheels and it\\u2019s got a railing around it, only on three sides, though. So they enter it from the back where there\\u2019s no railing. They have to stand in this and the dance role person makes them announce what they have asked to say. So it almost feels like a humiliation, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a humiliation or an honoring as they\\u2019ve put them in this railing thing and wheeled them onto the stage. They say, \\u201dUm, we don\\u2019t want these roles. Thank you very much, but we graciously decline these roles.\\u201d Then the audience starts clapping. They don\\u2019t look upset, so I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cPhew, oh look at them. I\\u2019m glad that they have been true to themselves.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Rose Farm\\u201d This dream begins in the house where I grew up. I\\u2019m in the kitchen waiting for a phone call. Some man is in the basement and he\\u2019s making something and periodically he comes upstairs. He\\u2019s wearing a toolbelt, he has a saw and he grabs some nails that are in a box on top of the fridge and goes back down with them. So, each time he trucks up and down the stairs, I\\u2019m aware that he has not finished making what he\\u2019s making down there. There\\u2019s a special delivery that comes to the front door. I answer it and bring it back to the table to open. It\\u2019s a package that was sent by a woman named Maureen that composes aerobics classes for GoodLife Fitness in Canada. It says I\\u2019m sorry for your loss and open it up and it\\u2019s this choreography for an aerobics class. However, it\\u2019s just the musical score. There\\u2019s no direction of what to put with it. There\\u2019s another person in the kitchen now and she\\u2019s someone that teaches this class. I show her the score and say, \\u201cUm, this is a nice gesture but how useful is it without the steps? There\\u2019s no choreography. It's only the music.\\u201d She looks at it with me and says, \\u201cHmmm,\\u201d and starts to listen to it and see if she can put steps to it. She gives up and says, \\u201cthis is impossible.\\u201d She sits down and then I look at it again. I realize that the beat is in things you can do in 8 and if you take 5 steps to the front, 1 to the side, 1 to the back and go back to where you started it does equal 8. So I\\u2019m starting to try to figure this out and then the phone rings. It\\u2019s Maureen from Good Life and she\\u2019s in a peppy aerobics instructor voice, \\u201cHi, this is Maureen! Did you get my package?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, I did, but I\\u2019m not quite sure what to do with it seeing there\\u2019s no choreography.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh well, there\\u2019s a word for that.\\u201d And I reply back, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s Word!\\u201d as a rapper would say it. There\\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone and she\\u2019s somewhat offended. The conversation ends. I go back into the kitchen, fully prepared to keep trying to figure this out for myself when the carpenter has completed this small box. He gives it to me and says, \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d As soon as I take the box in my hand, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m on this old farm. The farm has a sign in front of it and it\\u2019s called The Rose Farm. There\\u2019s a pump so you can pump the water up out of the ground. Everything is made of granite, which is a rock, and it\\u2019s faded pink. It really breathes history. The farm is strangely quiet, it\\u2019s almost like a museum. There\\u2019s no real activity going on in it. I go inside the farmhouse and there\\u2019s an old woman sitting there. My cat is with me. I say to her, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought something to comfort you.\\u201d I set the box down on the table. She\\u2019s sad. She looks up. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought my cat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think mine only has about an hour left.\\u201d Rather than seeing where her cat is lying, I see it as a vision in front of my eyes and it\\u2019s kind of suspended between the ground and the ceiling. The cat looks old - it looks like a 25 year old cat. Its fur is matted and its skin is emaciated away from its bones. The joints are big and round like arthritic. My cat is a lot younger, it\\u2019s black. It comes with me into the kitchen and my cat sits down beside me. We both wait there with her. Then I look at the wooden box I\\u2019ve set on the table and then I realize that it\\u2019s a coffin for her cat and she says, \\u201cThank you, I\\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here.\\u201d She takes the coffin and goes into the room and doesn't come back - neither one of them. And then my cat and I sit in the kitchen. I\\u2019m patting my cat and then the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cLima\\u201d This dream starts as though I\\u2019m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There\\u2019s a function, so it\\u2019s quite crowded and there\\u2019s a lot of people, most of whom I don\\u2019t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There\\u2019s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there\\u2019s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it\\u2019s over and it\\u2019s been over for some time. He\\u2019s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I\\u2019m reading the letter, it\\u2019s two pages long and there\\u2019s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, \\u201cDid he say anything to you personally?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just news.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m reading it again. There\\u2019s a story about his cat named Lima. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, what\\u2019s happened to him?\\u201d because he has two of them and he\\u2019s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I\\u2019m reading that the cat is missing. He\\u2019s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that\\u2019s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he\\u2019s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I\\u2019m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what\\u2019s in the letter like he knows what\\u2019s in the letter and he\\u2019s going off about what\\u2019s in the letter. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what\\u2019s in here.\\u201d Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I\\u2019m over in the UK, which is a trip I\\u2019ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I\\u2019m over there. So now I\\u2019m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I\\u2019m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I\\u2019m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I\\u2019m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There\\u2019s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it\\u2019s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend\\u2019s flat and knock on the door. It\\u2019s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It\\u2019s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it\\u2019s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he\\u2019s asking me how my trip was. I\\u2019m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, \\u201cYes, one of my daughters is here.\\u201d Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.\\u201d That\\u2019s all he says. I know from that remark that she\\u2019s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she\\u2019s with some of her friends. They\\u2019re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she\\u2019s changed it to Grassy. I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.\\u201d She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, \\u201cIt was nice to see you.\\u201d I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I\\u2019m talking to my artist friend. I say, \\u201cOh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can\\u2019t keep up with it.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019ve each got some of you in them.\\u201d He kind of laughs and I ask him if he\\u2019s found his cat. He says, \\u201cNo, not yet.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, I saw the cat.\\u201d And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, \\u201cHmm, let\\u2019s just go check that out.\\u201d We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cWhose Room Will Be Whose?\\u201d In my dream last night, I am part of a family that\\u2019s moving in with another family. I guess there are parents in the dream because I\\u2019m a teenager, but we never see the parents that belong to us. So, the family that lived there before we lived there still have some of their stuff in some of the rooms. We are going through the whole house deciding whose room will be whose. There's two boys in the other family we're going to be blended with. I have at least one sister, although it\\u2019s never quite clear the extent of our family because there\\u2019s more bodies in that house looking at rooms than just two boys and two girls. The house was originally an older house and the family before us added on other things and made it into a very big house. So in the kitchen, which I\\u2019m thinking the original one would have actually been quite beautiful - we go upstairs and then there\\u2019s a landing. The stairs open up with three stairs that go to one side and three stairs that go straight and three stairs that go to the other side. So the original kitchen would have been three sides and then open on the fourth side. But now there\\u2019s two rooms that go off - one straight ahead and one to the side, so there\\u2019s been two walls that have been put up. Now the kitchen is very tiny. It\\u2019s long. There\\u2019s a counter, a sink, a stove and some cupboards above that. One room that the family before us has put up a wall so there\\u2019s no doorway left, so you have to turn your body sideways to get in. It looks like the father of the previous family has made it into a computer room, but what blows my hair back when I walk into the room sideways is the number of intricacies of all these different parts and different computers. There\\u2019s 4 monitors and all these tools and it\\u2019s like he builds computers. There\\u2019s stuff stashed literally everywhere from floor to ceiling. Then somebody from the other family is in there and I'm surprised because I didn\\u2019t realize they had this other kid, but she\\u2019s sitting and she\\u2019s involved with something that goes on with the computer screen. There\\u2019s what appears to be two of her friends standing around watching her do this. She makes this one comment to me when I\\u2019m in there: The dad has a Swedish computer and it\\u2019s hard to find anything else that fits with all these cords and parts and pieces. So I leave back out that room and think, \\u201cWell that definitely can\\u2019t be my room.\\u201d I go into the next one - it\\u2019s really small, it only has a single bed in it and a tiny dresser. The walls are poured concrete. I turn around, go back down the stairs, and go on to the lower level which has a bathroom in it and a laundry room and these three enormous bedrooms. As I go in there, I see one that\\u2019s long enough that I could set up my craft table and my yoga mat. There\\u2019s all kinds of things I can do in that room with the space because it fits more than just the bed and the dresser. But as I\\u2019m walking toward it, the older boy from the family we\\u2019re blending with says, \\u201cThis is my room.\\u201d Then the other room seems to go to the other boy, which leaves one more room that\\u2019s only 3 walls and is exposed on the third side, so I don\\u2019t want that room. Then as I turn around, the space that\\u2019s between the bottom of the stairs and where the rooms branch off to is a really, really big landing and it\\u2019s got some more of these intricate parts and pieces and cubby holes and things that are just filled with stuff that has belonged to the family before us. I\\u2019m just looking at it, fascinated with all these parts and the way they\\u2019re organized - highly organized. In fact, one drawer, I pull it out and there\\u2019s tools that are organized in chronology of increments that must be no more than 1mm apart. Apparently, they\\u2019re for the Swedish computer. So nobody else\\u2019s computers or electronics or things that you plug in are fitting in this house, so there\\u2019s this kerfuffle about finding other parts that are compatible. While I\\u2019m looking at all this, there\\u2019s this other girl that I didn\\u2019t realize the family had and she indicates the shelves that are currently full of tools and things: \\u201cThis Is where I\\u2019m going to put my gun collection.\\u201d There\\u2019s nowhere for me to put anything between the family\\u2019s stuff that is already there and this other extended family we\\u2019re blending with that\\u2019s taking all the rooms. There's nowhere for me to be here. Then I go into the washroom and decide I\\u2019m going to have a bath. While I\\u2019m in the bathroom, there's people coming and knocking on the door and needing their stuff. That\\u2019s where the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Attached Pool\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m in a place that\\u2019s very rocky. It looks like Niagara's escarpment and the houses built in that area. The escarpment commission won\\u2019t let you change the natural formation of the land in order to build there, so houses are very expensive and you have to go around the rocks with your architecture. So I\\u2019m with a couple of other people and they are judgemental about the houses built here and mocking the other people's wealth and ignorantly gossiping about the style of architecture to the extent that they\\u2019re just saying it\\u2019s stupid. I realize as I\\u2019m walking with this crowd of people and picking up on the remarks they're making that I know one of the people that lives in these houses. It\\u2019s a woman I taught a teacher training and she\\u2019s a nice lady, but her personality is very irritating. I stand still for a moment and the group of people walking behind me walk past. I\\u2019m gazing at the house they\\u2019re talking about and I see this woman come out of it. I think, \\u201cOh, this is her house.\\u201d They\\u2019ve built a change room for their pool and it\\u2019s like a giant treehouse. It\\u2019s unfinished with just dry-wall, but I can see her family coming out of it and they\\u2019re changed and ready for the pool. I walk a little closer to look at the pool that everyone was making fun of. The idea is genius. It\\u2019s like a large long narrow plexiglass tank that\\u2019s obviously been made to fit into the area between the rocks. It\\u2019s attached to the foundation of their house on one side and the rocks on the other side and it\\u2019s clear, so whatever nature is around it, is seen through the pool. So it\\u2019s almost camouflaged - you don\\u2019t notice it right away. It\\u2019s not finished, however, and there's no water in it. She sees me standing there and invites me in. Part of me thinks, \\u201cOh no,\\u201d because she has an annoying personality, and the other part of me is curious how they have done and structured this house. I\\u2019m taken by the architecture. I can\\u2019t really get out of it anyway without being rude, so I accept the invitation. I think, well I\\u2019ll just come in and have tea with them, I don\\u2019t have to stay long. So I do. Their house is quite busy. Her husband is expecting this business associate to come in and she\\u2019s running around doing stuff. I\\u2019m not sure what she\\u2019s doing, she\\u2019s just really busy. She leaves me sitting at the kitchen table with no tea. I'm just sitting there and this other business associate comes in. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, he\\u2019s getting annoyed that the husband is late.\\u201d So, I offer the business associate tea to keep him happy. I have a conversation with the business associate that\\u2019s very, very interesting (but I forgot it as soon as I woke up). As I\\u2019m offering him tea, he says that he likes chai, but he doesn\\u2019t normally order it because people don\\u2019t know how to make it. I suggest the ingredients I know of - \\u201cWhat about these? What about ginger root?\\u201d and he nods. And I say, \\u201cPeppercorns?\\u201d and he nods. And I say, \\u201cCinnamon?\\u201d and he nods. \\u201cCardamom seed?\\u201d More nodding. \\u201cWhole cloves?\\u201d Nodding. I say, \\u201cHow does that sound?\\u201d I can see them over on the counter. He says, \\u201cYes that would be a good idea.\\u201d So I boil the water and while we\\u2019re waiting, the woman comes back and says, \\u201cOh good, you\\u2019ve started it. I just didn\\u2019t have time. Go over there and get some grapes.\\u201d So I wash those and offer them to the business associate. She runs off again and I sit there and continue to have a conversation with this business associate. While we\\u2019re talking, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m in a kind of sailboat and I\\u2019m in a race. It\\u2019s already going on and we\\u2019ve turned around. Part of the race is to take a hard bank to the starboard and keep doing it until you\\u2019ve done this quick 360 turn and pick up the line of something else you\\u2019re supposed to drag. My partner turns the boat and I reach out and I\\u2019ve got the rope. We\\u2019re dragging this thing. Then immediately I\\u2019m in the sky and I\\u2019m looking down on the ship and there\\u2019s this small child in one of the boats with a suncover pulled right over and a towel over its head. Then I think, \\u201cOh, that's a good idea for sleeping on a boat.\\u201d Then we\\u2019re on the boat again and the race is over. We\\u2019re coasting into a dock, getting off, and the company I\\u2019m with say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go get something to eat.\\u201d And we\\u2019re in Mexico. We just start walking into town. The ground is hard packed sand from so many people\\u2019s feet walking over it for hundreds of years. It's still warm from the sun. It\\u2019s this beautiful reddish brown terracotta color. There\\u2019s no ugly black asphalt and I\\u2019m grateful for that feeling under my feet. As we walk in, there\\u2019s many hastily thrown together pubs made of wood. It\\u2019s the kind of wood you see Mexican furniture made out of - I don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s called. It\\u2019s painted bright colors. We go into one pub, sit down, and there\\u2019s nothing on the menu I can eat. It\\u2019s all cheese and beef and wheat. I ask if they have chicken. The woman serving us says, \\u201cI can get one.\\u201d And there\\u2019s these chickens running through the restaurant and she picks one of them up and cuts its head off. But the knife isn\\u2019t sharp and it takes three heaves to get it through. I`m horrified. Then I leave the table. I guess I can\\u2019t stand this in the dream. I walk over to the bar and I think maybe I\\u2019ll just get a beer and that will fill my stomach. So I order one. The woman brings it to me and I notice she's got a gigantic bag of laundry. I think I\\u2019ll just help her fold it. I start folding and there\\u2019s 5 pairs of tiny pants the same size, and suddenly in my vision I see she has quintuplets she\\u2019s looking after and trying to make money in the bar. This is just part of life. The customers sitting at the bar all know her. I fold the clothes and put them back in the garbage bag behind the counter where I found them. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Concert\\u201d The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I\\u2019m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don\\u2019t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It\\u2019s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I\\u2019m waiting for my turn, there\\u2019s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It\\u2019s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it\\u2019s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don\\u2019t question this in the dream - it\\u2019s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I\\u2019m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I\\u2019m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I\\u2019m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I\\u2019m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven\\u2019t put them in the bank and they aren\\u2019t very safe where they are rolled up and put in this ceramic vase. So it sparks my memories. I put them back in the vase. It\\u2019s too late to go to the bank tonight, but I will go tomorrow. Then I go back downstairs. Omar and his friend Al and a girl he\\u2019s taking with him have arrived and they\\u2019re in the living room. We are happy to see each other. I go down and am talking to them for a while. I see what he\\u2019s wearing and tell him I\\u2019m going to get changed. I go back upstairs and someone is in the shower. I find a rolled up wad of money on the floor. I turn around and Omar is behind me. I say, \\u201cIs this yours?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Oh, there\\u2019s so many people in this house and we don\\u2019t know all of them. Don\\u2019t go downstairs and just say, \\u2018whose wad of money is this?\\u2019\\u201d I say, \\u201cI won\\u2019t. I\\u2019m going to go put it in my room and I\\u2019ll find a way to make it known to someone so they know their money is missing.\\u201d I go back into my room and I change. I pick out a black mini skirt with gold thread around the hem. I think it\\u2019s very pretty and sparkly. I choose a white blouse and a jacket that goes overtop just a few inches above the hem of the skirt. I put on my black tights and a pair of bulky socks and boots that look really nice. Then I go downstairs and Omar tells me I look very nice. But I turn and Al\\u2019s friend (I don\\u2019t know her name) is wearing the same thing I am. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s really odd. That wasn\\u2019t what she was wearing when I went up the stairs.\\u201d I look over at Omar and he\\u2019s laughing. I shrug it off and I say to everyone in the room, \\u201cHow much money is everyone bringing?\\u201d So I\\u2019m trying to get them to look in their wallets. The person whose money it is that\\u2019s missing will realize it\\u2019s lost and I can return the money to whoever it is. But they all check their wallets and they say different amounts. I say, \\u201cOkay, well I\\u2019m going to go upstairs and get my money.\\u201d While I\\u2019m going upstairs, the person is still in the shower and I realize it\\u2019s my nephew, Jared. I wonder if the money belongs to him. I put the wad of money in the same ceramic vase as the other checks that I need to deposit in the bank. Then I look through my own drawers and I find my wallet. I take out 2 twenties and put them in the little clutch that I\\u2019ve decided to take with me for the night. I go back downstairs again. Someone else is in the living room and she\\u2019s showing Omar this fabric and saying, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this beautiful? It would make a nice skirt.\\u201d I look and say, \\u201cOh yes, it is.\\u201d This is all gold and if you look closely, the gold thread has created patterns of flowers and it\\u2019s shimmering. This gold is really quite beautiful. Then suddenly, it\\u2019s not fabric anymore. It is a skirt - a longer skirt. She says, \\u201cThis skirt costs $2,000 and people pay that for it and only wear it once. Within a couple of weeks it\\u2019s in a punk rock thrift store and that\\u2019s where I found it. This would look really nice on you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWow, you\\u2019re giving it to me?!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThank you so much!\\u201d I was thinking maybe I\\u2019ll change into it for tonight and then decide not to because it\\u2019s a long skirt and I want to save it for another time. I ask her if she would like some money for it. She hesitates and doesn\\u2019t answer and I\\u2019m thinking I could give her another twenty. I\\u2019m waiting and waiting, but she doesn\\u2019t answer me, so I thank her graciously. I go back upstairs and I put it in my room. I look into my wallet and I get out another $20 just in case to give to her. So I go back downstairs and by this time, I\\u2019m becoming conscious that it feels like it's the same time and all these activities are happening and we still haven\\u2019t left for the concert. So I say to everyone, \\u201cShouldn\\u2019t we be leaving?\\u201d They say, \\u201cYes, it starts really soon.\\u201d I look out the door and I see that someone else is coming in and they need to get ready for the concert. Right at that time, there\\u2019s a sliver in the time-space continuum and I\\u2019m at work. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to get back to meet everyone for the concert.\\u201d Then when I'm thinking that, that same time frame fabric opens up and I\\u2019m back in the house. I think, \\u201cOh good, everyone is still here.\\u201d But then we\\u2019re waiting for someone else to get ready. She comes back downstairs and she\\u2019s wearing that shimmering gold skirt. I think, \\u201cWow, this is really odd.\\u201d But again I just shrug it off and I\\u2019m trying to get everyone to go. I say, \\u201cWe should call for a cab.\\u201d But Omar\\u2019s friend is driving. I tell them there isn\\u2019t enough room for everyone in the one car. Then suddenly they have other rides and we get in the car and go. We arrive at the concert hall and I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s general admission. We find a place to stand on the floor. I feel like I\\u2019m in the masonic temple or the music hall. I decide it\\u2019s the music hall. It\\u2019s quite dark. The band is playing but there\\u2019s no lights on the stage or upstairs on the balcony. But I recognize the structure and I think, \\u201cOh I know where we are.\\u201d Then we start dancing as though the concert is just a background. It\\u2019s good. Omar and I are dancing and enjoying ourselves. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I\\u2019m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There\\u2019s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I\\u2019m packing bags. There\\u2019s a reason, although I don\\u2019t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I\\u2019m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing that?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, I have to do this anyway.\\u201d Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: \\u201cHow old is that child?\\u201d I look down in puzzlement and see that she\\u2019s only five. I think, \\u201cHow did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.\\u201d I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It\\u2019s not safe.\\u201d So, I tell him I\\u2019ve changed my mind. Then I\\u2019m uncertain what to do. Now I\\u2019m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we\\u2019re about to go to. I tell her that it\\u2019s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She\\u2019s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I\\u2019m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It\\u2019s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there\\u2019s one washroom to the left - it\\u2019s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There\\u2019s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we\\u2019re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I\\u2019m able to hear the one person I know - he\\u2019s an author - that he\\u2019s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he\\u2019s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we\\u2019re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I\\u2019m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I\\u2019m getting the feeling that there\\u2019s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don\\u2019t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there\\u2019s two of them - they\\u2019re also talking in hushed tones. I\\u2019m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I\\u2019ve come to this house for and it\\u2019s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn\\u2019t just an idea for a book, it\\u2019s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, \\u201cDo you recognize that?\\u201d I said yes. He says, \\u201cAfter this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.\\u201d So I agree. Then someone comes in that\\u2019s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he\\u2019s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he\\u2019s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s planning this way to get out that\\u2019s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that\\u2019s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I\\u2019m not really listening. I\\u2019m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who\\u2019s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that\\u2019s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat are they up to?\\u201d So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It\\u2019s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there\\u2019s urine all over the seat and it\\u2019s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s urine all over it. There\\u2019s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she\\u2019s still five and as I\\u2019m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I\\u2019ve been talking to and he\\u2019s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he\\u2019s drying it with another towel. He\\u2019s just had a shower. So he\\u2019s involved in what he\\u2019s doing. There\\u2019s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I\\u2019ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I\\u2019ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGoop Eye\\u201d I am in my house and trying to teach my YTT (yoga teacher training). It\\u2019s not the students that I have in it in real life. It\\u2019s different ones that I don\\u2019t recognize. One of them keeps coming with her husband and he drives her there and then waits in another room while we do the TT and then drives her back home. He doesn't go home in between. He\\u2019s old - probably 75 kind of old, and he has a very slow kapha like nature to him and he\\u2019s a genuinely nice man. I notice after the first couple of days that one of his eyes - his right eye - is swollen. I ask about it and say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong with your eye? Do you need some help for that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Then the next day when they arrive, it\\u2019s even more swollen. I\\u2019m questioning him and asking him - should he not go and see someone about his eye. Again he says, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with it. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Then the next day he comes back and it\\u2019s puffy and there\\u2019s this white goopy stuff growing around it and it\\u2019s swollen to the extent that there\\u2019s only a little tiny space between the upper and lower eyelid. I ask him if he can see out of his eye and he says no. Then I say, \\u201cCan I get a little better look at it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s pretty serious if you can\\u2019t see out of your eye.\\u201d As I get closer, now I can see in his eye. As I look into his eyeball, I see that there\\u2019s globules of this white stuff on the surface of his eye. I describe this to him and tell him what I see. He says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s related to this food that I eat.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, shouldn\\u2019t you get that looked at because it\\u2019s getting worse?\\u201d Then I realize I have to make a decision because he\\u2019s in denial and refusing to get help for his eye and now it\\u2019s visibly got gook on it. I\\u2019m afraid that he might be infecting my group of students. So I tell them that unless he gets the medical attention for his eye, they cannot come back to the YTT. But I\\u2019m also worried that we all might already be infected. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cWooden Ship\\u201d In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It\\u2019s between 40 and 60 feet long. It\\u2019s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he\\u2019s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it\\u2019s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It\\u2019s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It\\u2019s got debris filtered from the water as it\\u2019s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There\\u2019s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I\\u2019m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven\\u2019t gone all the way out into the body of water. We\\u2019re still going through the channel. I\\u2019m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: \\u201cRandy, it\\u2019s too shallow here, we\\u2019ll never make it through! We\\u2019re going to run aground!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, no, we\\u2019ll be fine. I\\u2019ve done this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s maneuvering the ship and I\\u2019m positive it\\u2019s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you\\u2019re going to scrape your keel. You\\u2019re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don\\u2019t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the ship just didn't run aground.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s because it has no keel.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! So how are we staying balanced?\\u201d Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it\\u2019s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, \\u201cOh, that explains that.\\u201d The dream speeds through the day on the water like it\\u2019s just a minute and we\\u2019re coming back through this same channel. Now it\\u2019s time to tie up. I\\u2019m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that\\u2019s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I\\u2019m climbing up, I realize it\\u2019s not attached to the wall and it\\u2019s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn\\u2019t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I\\u2019m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it\\u2019s a platform, like walking the plank. It\\u2019s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He\\u2019s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I\\u2019m okay. Now I\\u2019m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I\\u2019m standing there talking to him saying, \\u201cHow is this boat balanced without a keel?\\u201d He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it\\u2019s made of wood so it must be light plus it\\u2019s buoyant. There\\u2019s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It\\u2019s actually a hole. I\\u2019m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn\\u2019t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s Crime in Cafes\\u201d It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don\\u2019t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They\\u2019re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don\\u2019t even know how deep it goes. So there\\u2019s a self-serve area at one end - that\\u2019s the end that goes on and on and I don\\u2019t know how deep it goes. At the other end that\\u2019s open, it has long tables where you can take what you\\u2019ve selected and eat there with people. It\\u2019s packed. So, the dream opens and I\\u2019m sitting at a table. I\\u2019m not eating though. I\\u2019m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She\\u2019s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it\\u2019s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we\\u2019re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There\\u2019s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there\\u2019s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it\\u2019s finished, we go to the room next door. There\\u2019s another teacher in there that we\\u2019re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he\\u2019s trying to undermine the first teacher. We\\u2019ve gotten our lunch out and we\\u2019re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we\\u2019re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We\\u2019re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she\\u2019s still there. We share this information with her. She\\u2019s grateful. We tell her that we\\u2019ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you here at the same time the next day.\\u201d So while I\\u2019m lining up to go and get food, first there\\u2019s this thing that happens with gum. There\\u2019s a direction by the cashier - it\\u2019s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, \\u201cWhy are they doing this? I don\\u2019t even want all this gum.\\u201d So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! $50 for something I don\\u2019t even want.\\u201d However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I\\u2019m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don\\u2019t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I\\u2019m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he\\u2019s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no! That\\u2019s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!\\u201d He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn\\u2019t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I\\u2019ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don\\u2019t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There\\u2019s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It\\u2019s crowded and it\\u2019s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There\\u2019s people walking in the street. It\\u2019s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I\\u2019m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what\\u2019s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He\\u2019s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They\\u2019re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don\\u2019t know if they've purchased them or if he\\u2019s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what\\u2019s in the bag. They open it up and there\\u2019s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We\\u2019re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.\\u201d They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He\\u2019s giving it away and he\\u2019s giving it to children. He\\u2019s helping people. I think, \\u201cOh! Well he\\u2019s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they\\u2019re looking for this person?\\u201d So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn\\u2019t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren\\u2019t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I\\u2019m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she\\u2019s there. She\\u2019s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50\\u2019s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it\\u2019s got a rounded collar and she\\u2019s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s dressed up really nicely. She\\u2019s in her good dress.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t see me. In fact, we don\\u2019t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she\\u2019s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I\\u2019m supposed to have, knowing that I can\\u2019t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she\\u2019s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I\\u2019d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can\\u2019t really. I wonder if she\\u2019s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He\\u2019s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He\\u2019s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cyborg in Me\\u201d I entered my dream space as a cyborg. There was no one else in it. I felt nothing. There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn\\u2019t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that\\u2019s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That\\u2019s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn\\u2019t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Lecture Hall\\u201d The dream begins with me leaving the house I live in. I\\u2019m going to walk to a lecture. I have a backpack on. I\\u2019m wearing a raincoat. It\\u2019s quite a hike, but that\\u2019s not unusual for me. I like to walk. The walk takes about an hour. It\\u2019s just straight up a street, block after block, tree lined and very pretty. It\\u2019s a small town. It\\u2019s like walking up Cathedral Avenue in BC with huge trees that form an umbrella - they reach toward each other overtop. So I don\\u2019t even feel the rain. It\\u2019s raining out, but I\\u2019m not feeling it on my body or my face. I\\u2019m not getting wet. I arrive at the place where the lecture is and it\\u2019s a house. I realize that it\\u2019s the house of my professor, M.M. So, I walk up to the side and knock on the door and she answers it. The door opens out into her kitchen. She\\u2019s happy to see me, though we don\\u2019t hug. We stand about 6 feet apart, respecting social distancing. There's several other people in the kitchen and they're all in some kind of process of removing outer clothing and hanging it up on hooks. Then we go down the hall from the kitchen, into an enormous university style lecture hall where there\\u2019s theatre seats and a stage. At this point, M.M. disappears and I realize that the lecture is not on the psychology topic I thought it was on, but it\\u2019s two men who are standing there and they\\u2019re kind of counting the number of people that they have. I can overhear their conversation. They\\u2019re saying that they thought there\\u2019d be more than this. But, \\u201cthis is a good turnout anyway and let\\u2019s hope we can sell it.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh, man, I\\u2019m not here to buy anything,\\u201d and I\\u2019m disappointed. So the two men walk down the aisle towards the stage. They don\\u2019t even mount the stage yet, when people start leaving. Then the one man stands to the side and the other one gets up and stands behind the podium and he begins to talk but doesn\\u2019t say anything. More and more people are leaving until there\\u2019s only 3 or 4 people left. Then he ceases the talk and says, \\u201cWell I guess that was a bomb.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh good,\\u201d because I wanted to leave, too, but there were people on either side of me and I didn\\u2019t want to make a big deal about getting them to get up so I could leave. But they were leaving, so I was glad. So now I have to get my backpack and everything again. But during this moment, there\\u2019s this crowd by the door and I see M.M. again. I go up to talk to her. She\\u2019s got a man standing fairly close to her. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m so glad to see you. It\\u2019s been a long time. I can\\u2019t give you a hug, but I can dance with you.\\u201d So she reaches her arms out and we interlace fingers. It\\u2019s the dance where the one partner spins the other partner a half turn and your hands stay clasped with your arms over your head and then the arms straighten, you move away from each other, hands stay clasped, then the next time you go all the way in so the arms are crossed in front of you, you take a few steps forward and a few steps back, you do the half turn again so your arms become uncrossed but still stay laced at the fingers. She does this a couple of times with me. During one of the times when we\\u2019re shoulder to shoulder, I say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not okay to hug, but this is okay?\\u201d She says, \\u201ci don\\u2019t know!\\u201d Then we do the step one more time. The next time we\\u2019ve lengthened arms, she releases my fingers and steps back. She introduces me to the man, but doesn\\u2019t say his name. She just says, \\u201cthis is my friend.\\u201d We give each other the shoulder distance nod in recognition. I say, \\u201cThis is your house?! I\\u2019m surprised that you\\u2019ve moved.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I had to downsize and I have a tenant that lives upstairs. He\\u2019s a really nice man. Just go out onto the veranda and check it out.\\u201d So I do. I open the other door, walk up the steps, look at the door outside, look at the architecture a little bit, and come back down. I\\u2019m thinking I can\\u2019t believe this opens up into a lecture hall, but I don\\u2019t comment on the size of that. Then I just look around the kitchen a little bit, make some other comments about the design and the architecture. I\\u2019m admiring it. They\\u2019re all complimentary. Then, she says, \\u201cWell, it was nice to see you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes,\\u201d and tell her I need to go before it starts raining harder. So I go back into the lecture hall. Now my coat is on a coat rack - one of the tall ones that has a hook on either side and stands like a post. I begin to arrange my things. But now I\\u2019ve got two pillows and a yoga mat that I have to roll up and arrange with the backpack. So I put my raincoat on and then I roll the yoga mat up. The yoga mat is really thick and has clips and ties on it. I roll it up tight and squeeze it so the air goes out and it rolls up into this little stick. Then I wrap the clips around it, hook them and intertwine the hooks against each other so it will stay really tight. So now that\\u2019s taken care of. I put it on the bottom of my backpack. Then I put my raincoat on and think, \\u201cWhat am I going to do with these two pillows?\\u201d Now, I\\u2019ve got two raincoats. So the second raincoat - I fold the arms up and the hood down and I roll it up really tight and I squeeze the air out of it. I manage to get that in my backpack. Now I\\u2019ve got these two pillows. I think, how am I going to do this? They won\\u2019t fit in the backpack. I don't want to carry them. I don\\u2019t want them to get wet because they\\u2019re down-filled. So I put one against my back and then it takes me ages to reach my arm around to find the loop of the backpack. While I\\u2019m doing this, the two men that were to have the presentation are starting to gather their things up, too. The one comments to me: \\u201cSure is taking you a long time to get your stuff on.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer him. I just continue getting my stuff on because I think he\\u2019s just stated the obvious and it doesn\\u2019t require a reply. Then I finally find the second loop to my backpack - I get it around, I pull it against my body so the air squishes out of that pillows and I think, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019ve done it.\\u201d Now I have to do this again. How am I going to slide this other pillow down? I consider asking the man that I just ignored if he can slide the pillow in between the back of the backpack and the other pillow. But I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. Then I see the tenant come down from M.M.\\u2019s apartment at the top floor of the house. So I go walking back up out of the lecture hall instead. M.M. is still there talking to some people who are continuing to exit. She says, \\u201cOh wait a minute! I want to introduce you to my tenant.\\u201d She calls him the Chinaman. I think, \\u201cWow, why doesn\\u2019t she give him a name?\\u201d He shakes my hand and I shake his. I say, \\u201cHow long have you been living here?\\u201d He says, \\u201cSixteen years.\\u201d I exclaim, \\u201cSixteen years?!\\u201d and I look at M.M. and say, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize when you said it was a couple of years that it had been that long.\\u201d This is only significant because I haven't realized it\\u2019s been that long since she\\u2019s moved there with a tenant and I have not seen her. We chat for a little bit. He seems like a nice man. I ask him if he will slide the pillow down in between the other pillow and the back of the backpack. He says, \\u201cSure no problem.\\u201d He does that. Then I say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m all packed up. I leave. I have my stuff. I go back out into the drizzling rainy day and start walking back down the avenue and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cMacro-Level Choices\\u201d This dream begins where I am part of this diagram, so I\\u2019m watching what feels like a macro-level perspective of different groups of people\\u2019s food choices. What I see with my eyes is a big bluish grey, but not a chart...it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m inside the chart. I realize I'm looking at patterns of people at an anthropological level from around the world and the choices that they make in food. I\\u2019m watching them like small dots. I\\u2019m wondering what this is. I look at them and study them for long enough. They\\u2019re moving. I see almost like an arc, a pendulum, that swings from the cluster of dots of choices they make, and I\\u2019m not even sure that they\\u2019re all food related - I don\\u2019t think they are. They\\u2019re clustering. Then one of the dots will swing out like a pendulum, then pause. It\\u2019s moved into this other category of things that they\\u2019ve learned. The learning is an evolutionary succession. In the dream, I seem to understand the macro-level implications of this without needing to know the exact words or categories of each choice. My thinking brain is in wonderment at realizing what all these small clusters of activity arrive at - like an aha! Then I move from realizing that some of them are food choices. The dreams shifts from a macro-level to what is happening right now on the earth. Then I arrive in a restaurant. I\\u2019m looking at people\\u2019s food choices. It starts at a table with a woman I haven\\u2019t seen in a long time - Margie is one of my daughter\\u2019s friend\\u2019s mothers. I haven\\u2019t seen her since my daughter was in Grade 8 because the kids ended up going to different high schools. Margie sits down and makes some kind of comment like, \\u201cI thought we were friends, but you never contacted.\\u201d I express surprise at this and say, \\u201cYes, I live over here now and work every evening as well as in the day. I don\\u2019t have time for that kind of thing.\\u201d She seems to feel amenable to that explanation and starts talking to me about her family. As she\\u2019s talking, this other young lad, maybe 17, is hovering around the table and moving things. He\\u2019s getting his backpack and he\\u2019s putting things in it. Then he slides into the role of server and is cleaning some of the plates away. Only Margie\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s plate is left. Now I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s some kind of older step brother and wonder if she has remarried since I knew her. But I look at the young man and he has some features that look like Margie\\u2019s husband. So now I\\u2019m wondering if this young man is maybe a child of the previous marriage of the husband, which means they could still be together and I\\u2019m just seeing this man grown up. Then the scene shifts from the table in a restaurant. I\\u2019m now in the kitchen in their house. People are packing up and clearing away dishes from the table, still. Margie has asked me if I\\u2019ll come over for tea. I agree to do this. My own son has somehow been invited to go back and forth from my house to hers, which is actually something she would do - organize families on this slightly macro-level as dinner is going on because she is an accountant. He\\u2019s now only 7 and he has a scooter. There's the question of how he will get his things from my house to hers on this scooter. I tell him to try it right now: \\u201cPut all the things you have with you in a bag and we\\u2019ll weigh it. Is it too heavy to swing from one handle of the scooter?\\u201d It is. It will pull him off balance a bit. So I say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we roll the bag and I\\u2019ll bungee cord it to the back of the scooter. No one uses that space anyway. Then it will keep the mechanics more balanced.\\u201d Margie says, \\u201cOh yes! That\\u2019s a really good idea!\\u201d My son is now on the road and he gives it a couple tries up and down and says, \\u201cYes, it works.\\u201d Now I'm back in the kitchen - in the thought of the kitchen. The dream is shifting me through thought patterns. The young man is now ready to go and he hasn\\u2019t said anything I ask him if he needs a ride because he seems to be hovering. I ask him how he\\u2019s going to move from Place A to Place B. He declines the ride. Now, the dream pattern shifts and I\\u2019m in a restaurant and serving tables, moving food from underneath the heat lamp where it\\u2019s cooked in the kitchen out to the tables - I\\u2019m coordinating that. It tells you where to go because it has the name of the server on the paper beside the food as well as the table number. So I just do this for a little bit. Then my shift is over and I\\u2019m sitting in the breakroom counting up money and adding that up when one of the cooks comes in from the kitchen and says, \\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\\u201d I realize I\\u2019m not on the schedule for next week and the rest of the staff seem to know this and are questioning why this has happened. Each person, there\\u2019s probably 5 or 6 people who come into contact with me and tell me they\\u2019re surprised by this, and that I was doing a new job, and they are sorry to see me go, and then some questions about how they\\u2019ll keep in touch with me. I\\u2019m wondering, thinking, \\u201cOh so it\\u2019s not just me not knowing why I\\u2019ve been let go.\\u201d I decide after all of this to go into the office to see if I can ask why. I\\u2019m looking for closure. The part of the administration that\\u2019s responsible for scheduling doesn\\u2019t know the answer to that question and evades me when I ask direct questions, but doesn\\u2019t seem hostile. There\\u2019s the energy of feeling that person doesn\\u2019t know why they\\u2019ve been requested to do that either. So, I leave, put everything in my pack, make sure I\\u2019ve left nothing behind, and say final goodbyes. And here\\u2019s this young man again from the other thought pattern - the guy that might possibly be Margie\\u2019s stepson. He\\u2019s leaving at the same time, but now he\\u2019s asking me if I need a ride. I say, \\u201cNo thank you. I\\u2019ve got a car in the parking lot.\\u201d So I walk out with my things and put them in the car. I notice he\\u2019s putting his things in a red car. When he leaves, it\\u2019s really noisy. Then I get in mine. Now there\\u2019s snow on the ground. I\\u2019m testing my brakes. The brakes aren\\u2019t where they should be. So I gear down to navigate my car out of the parking lot because I have to make a right hand turn. Gearing down works and gives me a little extra time to figure out where the brake pedal has been moved to. It\\u2019s weight over on the left in a really odd place, where the clutch would be. But I\\u2019ve got it now. I have to make another right hand turn. Suddenly there\\u2019s a bus. The whole left hand lane is stopped, so I go even further left to go around. It\\u2019s okay even though my tires don\\u2019t really have traction in the snow. Now I'm driving through a city. I start job hunting. I stop at a few restaurants on my way home after applying to three different restaurants. They all say they don\\u2019t need anyone. Now I\\u2019ve driven to the complete opposite end of town and am back in the house where I would meet Margie for tea.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arms Dealer\\u201d This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he\\u2019s not there to buy books. I realize I\\u2019m not in my own body because I see my arm and it\\u2019s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that\\u2019s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can\\u2019t see the other two names, but that\\u2019s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that\\u2019s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That\\u2019s the point I realize they\\u2019ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he\\u2019s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, \\u201cOkay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?\\u201d They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, \\u201cEh, shouldn\\u2019t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren\\u2019t we not supposed to jostle this material or there\\u2019s the danger of it exploding?\\u201d Man consciousness me says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d The part of my own consciousness that\\u2019s trapped in there says, \\u201cYou have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can\\u2019t have any cough. It\\u2019s not supposed to be jostled once.\\u201d I feel frustrated inside this guy\\u2019s consciousness. Then, he has a few things that he\\u2019s gathered and puts his arms around them and carries them. It feels like the way it would feel as though you were carrying two bags of groceries with loaves of bread in them with one tucked under each arm. I compare it to this. Then he walks up the alleyway and into his house. I notice that the house is really overcrowded and has toys and books and stuff everywhere - belonging to someone who never cleans up. Then he goes into the kitchen and the rack they use in restaurants for putting dishes on and then putting them through an autoclave machine - he sets three loaves of bread on the dish rack and puts them in the oven, but doesn\\u2019t turn it on yet. He\\u2019s still got this dry cough, and I think, \\u201cWow, isn\\u2019t this guy going to take care of that?\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t. Then he sits down at the table, ostensibly to wait while these things do whatever they have to do in the oven. Then the part of the man that\\u2019s my consciousness starts to take over and the man consciousness starts to go away. Now I\\u2019m me and I\\u2019m sitting there looking around at this mess and thinking, \\u201cUgh, I have to start cleaning this up.\\u201d Then across from the table, Omar appears. I tell him, \\u201cWhat is wrong with these people? Why is everybody in denial? There's so many other choices that people make. I don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d He nods his head and agrees, then asks me if it\\u2019s okay if he uses my bicycle from the garage. I say, \\u201cYeah, do you know which one it is?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I think so. It\\u2019s the one your ex-husband\\u2019s been using.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?! What are you talking about? Why would either one of you want to use my bicycle?\\u201d It\\u2019s got the two white bars that go down and purple - it looks like a girl\\u2019s bike. He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it looks like now.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat does it look like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, your husband modified it. It\\u2019s got a motorcycle seat on it. And he took out the hump in the middle, so you can sit upright on it.\\u201d I\\u2019m starting to get riled up because he never asked me if he could do that. Then I look back at Omar and say, \\u201cThis is the problem! He never respects my boundaries and he always does these things without asking first. Do you think it\\u2019s unreasonable that it upsets me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo that is a normal thing.\\u201d Then he makes reference to his ex-wife and he says, \\u201cEven in my marriage, we asked each other for permission.\\u201d Then he starts laughing and he takes a piece of paper and shows me - it\\u2019s written the way you would write out a script in a play with the one person\\u2019s name, then the colon and the line then the other person. There\\u2019s 10 lines of just one-liners. First it\\u2019s him and his ex-wife, him and his ex-wife, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, all the way down. Then one of them throws their hands up in exasperation and says: \\u201cOkay fine!\\u201d So he just hands it to me and I read this. Then he\\u2019s laughing and says, \\u201cWell at least it\\u2019s agreement.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m laughing, too, and say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s better than just taking it without asking, then modifying, then just walking away again, leaving it in the modified form so I can\\u2019t use it anymore.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cAlright, well I have to go to work.\\u201d So I follow him down the hallway. As I\\u2019m passing through the kitchen, I look at the store and think, \\u201cWhy is it at 77 degrees Celsius?!\\u201d I look with alarm and think, \\u201cOh yeah, that\\u2019s from the man consciousness body.\\u201d I see the three loaves of bread in there and they are starting to disintegrate with the heat. It\\u2019s vaporizing the plastic bags, and I think, \\u201cOh, isn\\u2019t that going to melt and cause some trouble in there?\\u201d But the temperature is so high that it just vaporizes. Then I realize I have to leave that there because this is the man consciousness\\u2019 house. But when I get in the hallway and go to say goodbye to Omar, I see two jackets. I realize one is the 4 year old boy, one is the 8 year old boy, and I look at Omar in alarm and say, \\u201cWhat are they doing here in this house?! They\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d But the part of me that is also in the man\\u2019s body sees that they belong to his kids. The consciousness that is me suddenly categorizes the overcrowding of stuff and not tidying up and putting away is from his kids. He\\u2019s making this money and also has this dual role of taking care of his family even though he\\u2019s doing it illegally. At that moment, he\\u2019s simultaneously opening the door and there\\u2019s my own two cats. They get out of the house and start to go up the street which is now a different street. It\\u2019s crowded with people and families. Kids are playing in the snow and it\\u2019s wintertime. Everybody has on snowsuits. There are toboggans and some ice and people are skating. I see my one cat has been interested by a bird. There is a group of people that are around my other cat and they\\u2019re putting snow on him and patting him with the snow and he\\u2019s enjoying it. So I get her first - I catch her just before she leaps into the air to take off after the bird. But I know I can\\u2019t carry them both at the same time. So as I\\u2019m walking back to what is now my own house, I see Kathryn, one of my students, and I ask if she can hold my cat for a moment while I get the other one. She says, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019ll just grab this one.\\u201d And she gets the second cat while I still have my first cat and am putting him back in the house. Then she sets him down for a second while she frolics off and does something else. I just think, \\u201cWhat is wrong with people that they just can\\u2019t follow through?\\u201d Then I put my tiny almost brittle cat back (her spine is uncomfortable when you pick her up and she gets squirmy) in the house and pick up my other one - he\\u2019s much heavier. I can feel his fur and his heavy body and his skin. So now they\\u2019re both back in the house. Everybody is safe and it\\u2019s just my house. My dream ends there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Greenhouse\\u201d This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I\\u2019m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He\\u2019s in a van and he comes out of the van. He\\u2019s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there\\u2019s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can\\u2019t because he can\\u2019t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I\\u2019m draggin him up with me so he can get there. Now it\\u2019s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we\\u2019re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I\\u2019m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it\\u2019s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there\\u2019s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They\\u2019re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They\\u2019re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo! Stop, stop!\\u201d The cat goes backwards, but doesn\\u2019t see where it\\u2019s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I\\u2019m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It\\u2019s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I\\u2019m cradling it in my arms and see that it\\u2019s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The other one is still in there. The cat starts to squirm and wants to get down. The ex comes in and says, \\u201cHow did this mud get in here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, Luke must have tracked it in.\\u201d He glares at me and gets really angry and says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you dare say that name out loud.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? He was here. Didn't you see him outside at the top of the hill?\\u201d Now he\\u2019s really mad at me and tells me I\\u2019m a liar and stop saying that. So I say to him, \\u201cYou didn't see him?\\u201d Then he storms out of the house. Then I remember that Luke told me to get vinegar to pour on it. So I go into the kitchen to get vinegar out from underneath the sink. I pour it on top of the mud that has the maggots and stuff in it. They all die. Then as I\\u2019m cleaning up, the dream deconstructs. I\\u2019m suddenly in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house. I\\u2019m in the process of planting a garden. Their house is huge. It\\u2019s like a mansion down by the shore of the lake. The greenhouse has long raised beds in it and really tall domed windows that arc over the top. They\\u2019re really dirty. There\\u2019s an old garden that looks like it hasn\\u2019t been tended for a while. I leave the greenhouse and walk across the grounds into a shed and find some tools. But as I open the shed door - it\\u2019s creaky and there are cobwebs. I find a hoe and some shears. I take them back to the greenhouse. I start to till and aerate the earth with the hoe. I notice that some of the plants that decayed and died have seeds in them. I\\u2019m making sure that I shake the plant - agitate it a little, so some of the seeds go into the earth as I\\u2019m hoeing. Then a man comes up - I assume he is the gardener. He is wearing a uniform and he questions what I\\u2019m doing. I tell him I am restoring the garden. He starts giving me some instructions. I say, \\u201cDid you used to be the gardener here?\\u201d He says yes. I realize that he\\u2019s also dead. He can\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s instructing me to do. So I listen to him. I ask if he knows where there\\u2019s any vinegar. He says, \\u201cYes, there is some here. I will arrange for it to be delivered to you.\\u201d So I start to till up one side - there are two long raised beds, 30 feet long each. As I till the greyed earth on top, I see there\\u2019s rich black earth underneath. I feel inspired by this task. Then I see that some kind of delivery has appeared. I remember that I also asked him for some balck earth. So there\\u2019s a bag of black earth and some vinegar. There\\u2019re also buckets, cloths and a sponge mop. I think, \\u201cGreat, I can wash these windows so the sun can come through.\\u201d I do that. It looks beautiful. Then on the other side, there\\u2019s a child - I don\\u2019t know who it is. I start showing them how to till up the earth so that seeds can be planted in holes, then how you can make the raised be up around the small plants, then you\\u2019ve got a little line between where water can go and people can walk if needed. So this child is helping me, but I still don\\u2019t know who it is. At the end of the day, I end up with some tall seed flowers in the back, some sustainable things we can eat coming up, as well as some herbs. There\\u2019s soup herbs, soup vegetables, fruit, nuts, pollinator flowers and natural insect repellent flowers. I picked red, yellow, orange and purple flowers. So it\\u2019s going to be a beautiful garden. We\\u2019re not all done, but it\\u2019s just too much to do in one day, so we leave. The child disappears. I\\u2019m walking across the grounds which are quite large. It takes a little bit of time to walk. When I get to the other side, I\\u2019m at the road. I walk up the road. I start to go through the outskirts and through old suburbia with 300 year old trees. I come to a house and realize it\\u2019s a rental. There\\u2019s a bottom floor for rent and top floor for rent. Suddenly a real estate agent appears and is describing when the tenants are leaving. The bottom floor is going to be empty today, the top floor tenants aren\\u2019t going to be leaving for a couple weeks. So she asks if I\\u2019m interested in the bottom floor. Since they are in the process of moving, it\\u2019s okay for us to go in. I really like it. I love the treed lot. There\\u2019s lots of natural shade over the sleeping area. The bedrooms are large and I like how the bedrooms are separated from the activity part of the house. So it will be good for sleeping. The kitchen is nice and big - there\\u2019s enough space for eating and a prep area. So I tell her that I\\u2019ll take it, but I\\u2019m also wanting to put a catio outside of the entry to the backyard so I can put my cats in it and they'll have lots of space to climb and run. Now the current tenant is there. Suddenly he has something I can easily use as a catio. He has a strange creature in it. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog, but as I get closer, I realize it\\u2019s some kind of rodent about the size of a small dog. I think it\\u2019s from South America. He\\u2019s a very sullen man - he doesn\\u2019t look like he wants to talk. I do ask him what kind of pet that is. He doesn\\u2019t answer me. He keeps the same expression on his face. We go back into the house and now I realize that I need roommates for this because there are four bedrooms and I can\\u2019t afford it by myself. There's the question of who will be the roommates. The real estate agent is interviewing some people. Two of them I know there is no way I can live with. One is someone I know and have actually lived with before, and I say, \\u201cYes, that will work. Please interview her.\\u201d Suddenly I\\u2019m moved in and I\\u2019ve been living there for a little while. I have two other roommates. I feel like they came with the house. The one roommate\\u2019s bedroom, when I\\u2019m trying to sleep, they\\u2019re sleeping area moves out like an extending wall in a motorhome. When he goes in to sleep, the bed extends over the feet of my bed and I can\\u2019t stretch my legs out when I'm sleeping. So I don\\u2019t like this arrangement. I contact the real estate agent and say, \\u201cOkay, it\\u2019s been a couple weeks. Are the other tenants getting ready to move out?\\u201d She says yes. So I look at their place. It\\u2019s a little smaller, but I will still be able to keep the catio for my cats. So my dream ends where I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cCan we either ask these two other guys to move out, or is it okay that I just transfer my lease to the other side of the house?\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bird Cage\\u201d In this dream, I am in an apartment building and my neighbor has asked me to feed his dog while he\\u2019s away. He\\u2019s not away for very long, just a couple hours. So when I enter the apartment, the door is not locked. In fact, it\\u2019s ajar. The dog is just lying down on the floor. He has birds in a birdcage. The birds are making a really loud noise. As I approach the birdcage, I notice the door is wide open. The cage is rectangular, 2 feet long, a foot high, and a foot deep. So the door is 2 foot by 1 foot and is open. Yet the birds don\\u2019t try to leave. The song is not the song they would normally make and this puzzles me. There\\u2019s a mixture of birds - pigeons, song birds, sparrows. None of them are making their song. It\\u2019s this rapid alarm noise and they\\u2019re all making it despite different species, which also puzzles me. I wonder if they\\u2019re afraid of the dog. But I\\u2019ve been in this apartment before visiting, and I know that the birds and the dog will sit together on the floor, so I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s the reason. So I feed the dog. Then I wonder why he hasn\\u2019t asked me to feed the birds. I look around to see if there\\u2019s any food and there isn\\u2019t. Then I\\u2019m curious about this noise they\\u2019re making again. And I wonder why they don\\u2019t fly out of the cage because they sound afraid to me. As I get closer to the cage, their noise stops. As I back away , it gets louder. I wonder if I should stay to comfort them. Then the dream just ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Swan Costume\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m in Spain, I think. It\\u2019s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I\\u2019m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it\\u2019s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He\\u2019s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that\\u2019s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I\\u2019m in a different country. I'm a different person. I\\u2019m in a kitchen scene where I\\u2019m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there\\u2019s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I\\u2019m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I\\u2019m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I\\u2019m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It\\u2019s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s kind of interesting.\\u201d I look at it. I have the plant in the other hand. I think, \\u201cHmm, now the seeds from the plant are gone.\\u201d I\\u2019m moving the slats on the shudder in a cupboard and it\\u2019s chafed the seeds out and collected them. So I close the cupboard board and put the bare plant on the counter. I turn around and now there are more dishes on the island. My sibling is doing nothing. I speak sharply to him. I refresh the water in the sink and put the plug back in. I notice that there\\u2019s 4 inches of unwashed cutlery in the bottom that he's been pretending to do. I speak sharply to him about that. Then I do some of it myself, but am thinking that if I keep doing this myself, he\\u2019s never going to learn to do it. So I put fresh water in then turn the tap off and tell him he needs to do his work if he\\u2019s ever going to get out of the area. I go back and finish my own. I\\u2019m disgusted in the dream by the sludge in the bottom of the sink and the pile of food bits and organic waste in the plug that I have to pluck out and dump. The dream flips back to the other scene where I\\u2019m in this palazzo in Spain. Now, the day has progressed and it\\u2019s almost nighttime. My father\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t know where he is. I\\u2019m suddenly supposed to be helping these people find costumes for a masquerade. They come in and I\\u2019m at the end of the palazzo. There\\u2019s a really long bar of clothing hanging from it. People are coming in one at a time, saying what they want to look like. I go through the clothes hanging from the bar and I hand them one and they just walk away with it. It\\u2019s not a line up and not a popular thing. I start to look through the clothing. I become absorbed by the feel of the material. The satins are really dark, the black is really inky and they feel smooth under my fingers. Then this woman comes up. She says, \\u201cDo I have something that will make her have a more shapely butt?\\u201d I think, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I start looking through the clothing and I find something. She says, \\u201cHow do I use this?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m wearing black gloves. As I\\u2019m looking through, the knowledge comes to me and I say, \\u201cYou put this part on and it pushes your low back down into your butt, which loosens the skin a bit. Then you put this part on and it pushes from the hamstrings up to fill it.\\u201d Then I warn her that it says on the tag to be very careful because this can be hard or dangerous for your low back. Then there\\u2019s a costumed part that goes around the upper body. It kind of looks like a man\\u2019s lapel from a suit. So she takes it anyway and walks away. Then I\\u2019m concerned about this. I go to try and find the mother - she\\u2019s not my mother, she\\u2019s just another part of the family that works there. I tell her that someone just wanted that costume. She doesn\\u2019t reply to my question. She says, \\u201cI have something I think you would really like. Wait here for a second.\\u201d She goes and gets it. It\\u2019s white. She says, \\u201cHere, feel this.\\u201d I feel it and it\\u2019s got form to it. It\\u2019s white. There\\u2019s a feathery feel, like the way feathers would feel on a white bird if you just ran your hand over the top of its head and down towards the back with the grain of the feathers. It\\u2019s not stretchy material. It has form to it like a ballet dancer\\u2019s costume. She says to go try it on. As I do this, I see her nephew come in. He\\u2019s a man. He sees me holding that in my hand. Then he looks down. I feel there\\u2019s some kind of disapproval and also some attraction in his eyes. I go into the bathroom and put it on. I make sure I go into the small bathroom only made for only one person because I don\\u2019t want anyone else to see me in this, but I do want to see what it looks like. It has a full length mirror in it. So I put it on. I like the way it contrasts with my brown skin. It feels really nice when I put it on. It has a little bit of weight to it. When I turn around and look in the back, first I notice there\\u2019s a bikini line on my body which is at odds with the line of the costume. The back of the costume comes up like a thong and there\\u2019s a big scooped part that goes up over my hips from the leg. Because it\\u2019s got form to it, it doesn\\u2019t sit on my body - it doesn\\u2019t cling to it. It moves a little bit when I move. I\\u2019m slightly concerned about this because it\\u2019s a bit big for me. But I turn around and it\\u2019s also got these four other pieces that are about maybe 8 inches long, curved gently like an \\u201cS\\u201d the way the downstruck in treble clef goes. They\\u2019re also white and they\\u2019ve got downy feathers around the top. I realize they\\u2019re to frame my eyes. They tuck in with little straps at the top of the costume quite nicely and stay there. So the one curved in sits on the top of the shoulder and it goes up the side of my neck and then curves again gently underneath my eyes towards the inside of my nose. There are two on each side - one goes to the inside of the eye, one goes to the outside of the eye. I actually really like these and I spend a few moments admiring the craftsmanship , the velvety feel of them and the way they fit over the top of the shoulders. I like how they feel around the outside of my eyes. They kind of hide the eyes, too, because it\\u2019s like a masquerade. Then I turn around because I\\u2019m concerned that the costume moves a little bit of its own accord when I\\u2019m walking. Now I notice I\\u2019ve got these really high white heels on. I\\u2019m wishing there was some carpeting on the floor because they\\u2019re quite slippery against the painted stucco and that makes me feel a little nervous. But as I turn around and check out the back again, I bend over a little and think I can't bend over in this and have anyone see me because you can see more of my anatomy than I want roving eyes to be looking at. But as I do this, I feel myself turned on. I feel that move from my body as I look back at the front view in the mirror, I feel heat between my legs and a warmth in my yoni that\\u2019s spreading outwards. I can feel the beginnings of an orgasm and this wakes me up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Ex\\u2019s Whiskey Bottles\\u201d I\\u2019m in an apartment. I\\u2019ve just moved there. I'm surrounded by all these things, almost three-quarters of them are my ex-husband\\u2019s. I don\\u2019t notice this until I\\u2019ve hired two people to come help me clean because I can\\u2019t get it all done. One woman makes a comment that she can\\u2019t clean around all this stuff. She asks me if I can move it. I apologize and say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m trying to go through all this.\\u201d Then I ask her what stuff she\\u2019s talking about. I look at it and the stuff she\\u2019s talking about is gold whiskey decanters. They\\u2019re all different kinds and shapes and they\\u2019re valuable and they\\u2019re all empty. People have given them to us. I never filled them because I don\\u2019t drink whiskey. I didn't throw them away because they were gifts. Some of them I haven\\u2019t even looked in. So she\\u2019s indicating them. I pick them up. These ones are squares - six squares made of gold with rings on the top that you pull on and the decanter slides up out of the square gold carrying case. That\\u2019s when I notice they\\u2019re empty. Then I realize that he\\u2019s taken some of them, but only the ones that had whiskey in them. So I think, \\u201dWhat am I going to do with all these?\\u201d Then I open the door and in the hallway, some sales rep from a whiskey company has set up a display of different kinds of whiskey. I think, \\u201cHmmm, I wonder if I can just set all the decanters up there when they\\u2019re not looking and they'll just think it\\u2019s part of the display.\\u201d So, now I\\u2019m busy with that. I\\u2019m opening the door, peeking out into the hallway, and waiting for all the people to leave so I can do this.\"],[\"\\u201cGetting Ready to Cast Off\\u201d I\\u2019m on my friend Lynn\\u2019s sailboat. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We\\u2019re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I\\u2019ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I\\u2019m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we\\u2019re waiting because the wind has died down. We\\u2019re waiting for the wind to pick up. There\\u2019s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It\\u2019s really silly. I\\u2019m on this dinghy and it\\u2019s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I\\u2019m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I\\u2019m hanging on to the mast and sail. It\\u2019s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I\\u2019m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, \\u201cHmm, I could actually fall asleep here.\\u201d I\\u2019m in danger of doing so. I think, \\u201cWell, I better not fall asleep.\\u201d So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, \\u201cWell, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.\\u201d I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I\\u2019m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I\\u2019m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it\\u2019s not in the dreamscape anymore. I\\u2019m swinging around on this rope. I\\u2019m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I\\u2019m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I\\u2019m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I\\u2019ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn\\u2019t get tangled on anything. Now I\\u2019m wondering what else I\\u2019m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they\\u2019ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, \\u201cOh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I\\u2019ll paint rocks.\\u201d So all of a sudden, there\\u2019s another person who I actually work with, though I\\u2019ve never sailed with her - I don\\u2019t think she sails. She\\u2019s been invited to go on the boat. I\\u2019m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she\\u2019s doing to pass the time and she\\u2019s painting rocks. I think, \\u201cWell this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she\\u2019s used.\\u201d I kind of go up tentatively because I don\\u2019t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, \\u201cWhat kind of paint are you using for that?\\u201d She tells me that it\\u2019s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, \\u201cNo, I just came back from Michael\\u2019s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they\\u2019re doing something that\\u2019s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.\\u201d So I ask her where it is and she says, \\u201cHere, it\\u2019s on this map and it\\u2019s marked with an X so that we don\\u2019t go there.\\u201d I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don\\u2019t want Lynn to know I\\u2019ve gone to Michael\\u2019s as well because she\\u2019ll be upset. So I think, \\u201cI\\u2019ll just go to the Dollar Store.\\u201d As I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store, I don\\u2019t have any shoes. I\\u2019m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they\\u2019re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I\\u2019ve got a bag. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I\\u2019ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It\\u2019s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we\\u2019re going to cat off. But we don\\u2019t! It\\u2019s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she\\u2019s been sewing something. She asks me if I\\u2019d like to make something. I say, \\u201cWell, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you\\u2019re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it\\u2019s very cooling. So I\\u2019ll make one of those.\\u201d So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That\\u2019s the end of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cSpirit People\\u201d I\\u2019m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they\\u2019re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We\\u2019re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don\\u2019t say anything. I\\u2019m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it\\u2019s on the top floor. She says, \\u201cThis is where we\\u2019re supposed to go - my contact is up here.\\u201d We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we\\u2019re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we\\u2019re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I\\u2019m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, \\u201cWait here. I\\u2019ll be back in a moment.\\u201d So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.\\u201d The first yoga class is all the bride\\u2019s family. They\\u2019re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that\\u2019s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I\\u2019m figuring there\\u2019s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they\\u2019re serving food. They\\u2019re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren\\u2019t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I\\u2019m suggesting we leave. But they\\u2019re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they\\u2019re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person\\u2019s hair. I look and it\\u2019s someone I recognize. I didn\\u2019t know her very well, though, and I hadn\\u2019t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I\\u2019d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I\\u2019m hugging her and saying, \\u201cWow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so very long,\\u201d I realize in my dream mind that she\\u2019s dead. We don\\u2019t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I\\u2019m seeing more people that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there\\u2019s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don\\u2019t know her - we don\\u2019t have any close conversations. She\\u2019s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, \\u201cOh, that can\\u2019t be good and why don\\u2019t you say something...you\\u2019re passive to this?\\u201d Then her son comes up. I just know it\\u2019s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: \\u201cI can tell whose son this is!\\u201d I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, \\u201cAlright, it\\u2019s time to go. We don\\u2019t have anything to do here.\\u201d So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re just gone. I look down and I\\u2019ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they\\u2019re attached. I think, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t mine.\\u201d I know where it\\u2019s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, \\u201cHey, I think this is yours.\\u201d He looks at it and says, \\u201cOh, I haven\\u2019t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.\\u201d I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I\\u2019m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can\\u2019t accept it until I\\u2019ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I\\u2019m waiting and it looks like he\\u2019s going to disappear back into the store and I\\u2019ve still got this pot I\\u2019m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it\\u2019s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I\\u2019m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I\\u2019m walking into Mandy\\u2019s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it\\u2019s been there for ages. There\\u2019s another pair over by the sink. There\\u2019s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I\\u2019m just hearing the voice and deduce that it\\u2019s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It\\u2019s covered with seran wrap. It\\u2019s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, \\u201cOh, she\\u2019s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!\\u201d So, I ask her if she\\u2019d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there\\u2019s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it\\u2019s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He\\u2019s got hair like Mo from the \\u201cThree Stooges\\u201d but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it\\u2019s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he\\u2019s dead and she\\u2019s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I\\u2019m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there\\u2019s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I\\u2019m wearing my own wedding dress. He\\u2019s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He\\u2019s talking to me about something and I don\\u2019t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we\\u2019re in our bedroom and making love.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Feast\\u201d The dream is strange and hard to articulate. There are moments when I\\u2019m in the dream and moments where I\\u2019m looking down and observing the events of the dream. So it starts with being in a carpool parking lot where you're waiting for others to arrive and you leave your car there, then gather in one car. I\\u2019m standing in the parking lot waiting. The car with two people in it that I\\u2019m supposed to join arrives. I leave my car there and I don\\u2019t see it for the rest of the dream. I know one of the people in the car - my friend, Janice. She\\u2019s a paraplegic. The car has hand controls on the steering wheel. Her chair is behind me in the passenger seat. This car will only fit one other person. The other person is supposed to meet us there. We wait for a little bit and she doesn\\u2019t show up. It\\u2019s Lisa, a person I know but am no longer friends with. After we wait a little bit and decide she must not be coming and just didn't tell us, we leave and we drive down the expansive highway to where we\\u2019re supposed to be going - a wedding reception. At this point, I\\u2019m suddenly elevated above the car and watching it move along the highway. I\\u2019m not so far up that it looks like a dot on the map. Maybe it\\u2019s a birds eye view. I can see the trees. I can see the ground. I can see the roofs of houses - they aren\\u2019t that far down from my vision. So I see the car arrive in the parking lot of where the reception is supposed to be held. Then, I help get the chair out for Janice and she gets in it and we both enter into the wedding reception area. She\\u2019s sitting with different people than I am, so we part at the door. I find my seat. I\\u2019m sitting with this man. His name is James and he is the estranged brother of one of my closest friends, Maggie. He is an intolerant angry negative person. I wonder what he\\u2019s going to do next. There\\u2019s a series of platters of bread that the servers bring out from the kitchen. As they set them on the table, people start passing them to the right. Nobody is eating anything. We\\u2019re just passing these plates. At some point they stop being passed and are set down on the table. I look and the differences between the plates of bread are miniscule. Most of the plates are full of square pieces of bread - square buns. Some are plain. Some are glazed. Some have powdery substance. I wonder why no one is eating them. I take one off the plate. I ask James if he\\u2019s going to eat it and wait for his snarky reply. But he doesn\\u2019t say anything and he just takes one of them, takes a bite and sets it down on his plate. I do the same. I wonder who\\u2019s wedding this is. I look around for signs of who\\u2019s the bride and who\\u2019s the groom. I don\\u2019t like the bread. It tastes like sawdust and I only took a tiny tiny bite and set the rest of it down on my plate. I get up and start to wander around the table. It\\u2019s one long table full of people and there\\u2019s the sense that there\\u2019s other tables around me, but my peripheral vision is clouded. I can\\u2019t tell who\\u2019s sitting where. Then, I rise upwards again. I\\u2019m looking at this whole area from the birds eye view. I\\u2019m not quite clear what I\\u2019m looking for, but am just seeing cars coming and going on the highway. It\\u2019s the same thing every time. After a dream moment of doing that, I drop back down to the table again. This time I\\u2019m standing between Janice and somebody else at their end of the table. I\\u2019m aware that they\\u2019re talking, but I\\u2019m not involved in their conversation.I stand there for a few moments, then walk back to my empty seat at the other end of the table. Now there\\u2019s food on myplate. It\\u2019s an uninteresting selection of meat with gravy and mashed potatoes and carrots. I don\\u2019t eat any of it. I just look at it. I\\u2019m disengaged now from the feast and the people and the festivities. I see one other person I know enter into the reception hall. It\\u2019s a friend I\\u2019ve known for years, his name is Joshua. I go over to talk with him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Praying Mantis\\u201d My friend, Randy, asks me if I want to be part of a housing project that is on an island in the Carribean. I agree. We arrive on the island and he tells me that the house that we are going to build first, the one we can stay in and it\\u2019s not going to be on the land, it will be situated on rocks where the water flows, just off of the land. So we get off the airplane and get into a jeep. We\\u2019re riding in the jeep. One of the people that lives on the island is with us. The scenery is flat and wide and it\\u2019s hot and dusty, arid and dry. We arrive down to where the housing project will begin. True enough, as we get out of the jeep, there\\u2019s land and it\\u2019s slightly marshy and there\\u2019s a dividing line with rocks coming out from underneath the crust of land. There\\u2019s a little bit of water and it flows out from the crust like a very small stream, about 6 inches deep overtop some flat rocks. He says this is where the house will begin. There\\u2019s a number of people that live on the island that are already aware of this project. They are present. So we start to construct the house out of cement. The cement needs to be mixed. It\\u2019s poured and then it hardens. The walls are erected with these 2x4\\u2019s. The men are doing this part and Randy has already asked me previous to landing to design a garden. This is something he doesn\\u2019t know how to do himself, but I\\u2019m good at it. I\\u2019ve agreed. So while the men are doing that part, I\\u2019ve got some large pieces of paper, colored pens, and a geometry or drafting set. I start to sketch out the garden, being careful to also sketch out the house first that is not on the land at all and is not supposed to be touching the land, but is supported by the rocks. The house gets to the point where I can now help with some of the internal construction. I notice I\\u2019m wearing work boots, socks, a pair of cargo shorts, a cotton top and a cotton cap that I\\u2019ve made myself. I\\u2019m doing small construction jobs and am working the saw. We\\u2019re beginning the internal part of the house - a covered kitchen and closets in the rooms. Now there are more people helping. I\\u2019ve finished my garden drawing, colored it in and added some vegetation. At this point, one of the women involved in the project has commented on what I\\u2019m wearing. I\\u2019ve promised to make her a cotton top and cap, and also show her how to work a sewing machine. This is going to be on a next trip because I don\\u2019t have any of these things with me. The sun begins to set. People are passing around some oranges as well as something that looks like beer. I accept some of the food and drink and sit in the lawn chair. Randy has indicated that he wants me to sit in between him and one of the other people that live there. So I do. He starts asking me to share my knowledge of the garden and what I know of finishing houses like this on the inside. As I\\u2019m describing this, I realize that this kind of house and this project is a house that has not been built in this way before. Part of it is that the house is not supposed to be able to be swept away by the water. Also, the water has started to flow over the area around the house - it\\u2019s like a dock, but it\\u2019s not. Although, I\\u2019m also starting to see that there will be small boats that can go up and down using the current of the water. They don\\u2019t have keels. They will be tied up to posts that look like angle irons that have been pounded down around the house and this little bit of deck. The house is really small - it looks like the size of a shipping container. You\\u2019ll get your feet wet when you walk into the house. I wonder how practical this will be for spreading things that are on your feet from the land, onto the deck, into the house. But I see that your feet are clean - they are washed by the water by the time you get into the house. So now the sun has started to set and I\\u2019m getting a little bit cold sitting on the lawn chair. I move to go inside the house. Now I see that Randy has stocked some things to the living room, which is finished to the point that the walls and roof are there. There's a rudimentary shell of a kitchen. He also has a stereo. There is electricity now, which wasn\\u2019t in the original plan. He\\u2019s plugged something in and is playing music. He gets out an album and I notice that it's Led Zeppelin, but it\\u2019s one I\\u2019ve never heard before. I think this is weird because I know all their music. He puts it on and I listen to one side and comment to him, \\u201cOh this song is why you played this side of the album, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d He says, yes. It\\u2019s the only thing I can recognize that sounds like Led Zeppelin - a little bit of the guitar. It sounds like Jimmy Page is playing something, somewhat in his own style, but an instrument I don\\u2019t recognize - guitar like, but not actually guitar. Now it\\u2019s nighttime, our flight is due to go back, the day is over and any work we have left will be completed when we come back next time. So we pack things up and get into the jeep to go back. When I get in the jeep, suddenly Omar is there and he\\u2019s sitting beside me in the jeep. He\\u2019s asking me about what we\\u2019ve done there. I realize that Randy can see him. Randy is acting strange, almost like he\\u2019s somewhat possessive or jealous of me and the relationship that Omar and I have. I think this is odd because we\\u2019re just friends. However, we arrive at the airport and Omar doesn\\u2019t get in the plane. Randy and I do, and we have a conversation on the plane. First he looks at my drawings of the garden. He has some markers - there\\u2019s a bright orange, deep red and brilliant blue. He starts marking up the areas on the drawing. He\\u2019s asking, \\u201cWhat can I grow here?\\u201d I tell him. He uses the red marker for that. Then he asks, \\u201cWhat are some things that will grow in this area?\\u201d I describe the kind of food. He marks those and draws in some things with the orange. Same things with the other area and he draws in those with the brilliant blue. Then he puts the drawing away and. Then he asks me about the conversation I had with the woman. I say, \\u201cYes, I think there\\u2019s potential. I can teach her how to make all this clothing with the sewing machine, but I\\u2019m going to have to buy one to bring down there next time.\\u201d He asks, \\u201cHow are you going to get down there?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, isn\\u2019t that included in my work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re going to have to pay for your own flight to come back.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s not what we agreed on when I said I\\u2019d be part of this project.\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s acting jealous because of what I noticed in the jeep with Omar. That\\u2019s when I ask him about his behavior with Omar. He doesn\\u2019t reply to me directly. He doesn\\u2019t answer my questions. Now there\\u2019s this strange energy between us and I remain silent. When we get off the plane, there\\u2019s a gap in the dream. Instantly from the airport, I am now suddenly at Omar\\u2019s mother\\u2019s place and there's a summer gathering. It\\u2019s a potluck and a beautiful day out. It\\u2019s lovely to be in the family again. But I know they aren\\u2019t real and I just enjoy the day where it is. Then it disintegrates. I\\u2019m back in the project with Randy. I don't have enough money for the plane ticket and I don\\u2019t feel like I belong in that group anymore. There\\u2019s energy that is not what I thought it was going to be at the beginning. I\\u2019m reflecting on the day. I look down at my hands and I notice that they\\u2019re curled. The fingers are curled towards my wrists and they don\\u2019t look like my hands. Then I see that the relationships I had with the people don\\u2019t seem as authentic as I thought they were. Then I look at my shoulders and my shoulders look narrow and rounded. I think there\\u2019s something about me that looks insectoid. But it shifts and I\\u2019m thinking if I want to go back and finish this project. I\\u2019m torn between the promises I made to the woman who felt genuine to me and the now soured energy that I feel in my relationship with Randy and the project. But I look down at myself and I realize that my body doesn\\u2019t look like mine at all. I look like a praying mantis and I hate myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Dolphin\\u201d This was more of a visitation than a dream, where a dolphin or the frequency of dolphin kept engaging with my psyche as I was dreaming. I felt like it was trying to comfort me in some way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Language\\u201d This dream is a little complicated to explain. The best way I can lay out the architecture is that it\\u2019s kind of like a spiral. The first layer, when I go through it, I\\u2019m not quite in it, then each layer I'm a little deeper in. There\\u2019s also a vehicle for getting there and I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It doesn't move on the land. It\\u2019s not an airplane. It doesn\\u2019t go way high up in the sky. It hovers a little above the rooftops - perhaps the layer where birds are normally in, though I don\\u2019t see any birds in the dream. It moves really quickly. It moves through time, as well. So the dream begins. I\\u2019m exiting out of this vehicle into a town. I\\u2019m walking around the town looking for where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I don\\u2019t understand any of the language being spoken. So, I can\\u2019t ask anyone where to go. I\\u2019m just trying to feel my way around. I\\u2019m looking for a mental map of the things I need. For example, I\\u2019m looking for a place to eat, a place to study, a place to sleep. So the first time I go through here, I\\u2019m feeling ungrounded. I\\u2019m alienated because I don\\u2019t speak the language. But I\\u2019m starting to feel familiar with the urban landscape. There's a certain time I have to leave. I need to be back at that vehicle. So I\\u2019m rushing to get there. I get back in it and I leave. Then I re-enter that same town, exiting the vehicle. This time I\\u2019m looking for parks and recreational places. I\\u2019m looking for a place to swim and rest outside - not necessarily a beach, but a place I can rest after swimming. This time I have my son with me. We have found a place to rent bicycles and have rented a tandem bicycle. So I place my son on the back and I\\u2019m on the front. We both have little backpacks with what we need for the day. We are just leisurely riding around. We go to the place for swimming, not an ocean, I have a feeling it might be man made because it\\u2019s too small to be a lake. It\\u2019s quite beautiful. The water is clean and fresh, and there\\u2019s a groomed grassy area, as you would find in a park. We lay down some big towels that we\\u2019ve taken from our backpacks and we\\u2019re just lying there resting. It\\u2019s a nice day. After a little while we get hungry. I\\u2019ve already scouted a place where we can eat. So we get back on the bicycles and take our towels and everything with us. But our towels are wet and I notice that they\\u2019re wet when I put them in the packs. I\\u2019m thinking that we\\u2019ll need a place to spread them out so they don\\u2019t get moldy. So I take my son on the bicycle. We go to the place to eat. The food is good and tasty. I\\u2019m trying to decipher the language that the people speak. As I taste the food, I\\u2019m trying to taste the language. I\\u2019m trying to decipher it by noticing the flavors. When we\\u2019re both finished, instead of getting back on the bicycle, we walk through the urban area where we\\u2019ve eaten. I think, \\u201cWow, it would be really nice to have some kind of memento from the day.\\u201d So we enter one of the shops. It\\u2019s quite dingy. There are tables set out in garage sale type style. To enter the shop, you go through the door and downstairs to the basement, which is probably why it feels so dingy and dark. But the items on the table are quite expensive and big. A lot of them are made of big chunks of led crystal. I don\\u2019t want to carry something around like this - it\\u2019s not really my thing, anyway. They\\u2019re really rather formal. But we see this little spoon. It\\u2019s like a baby spoon, made of silver - it\\u2019s good metal. I look at the top of the spoon and it\\u2019s actually carved into - a rough rendition of Pikachu. I call my son over and say, \\u201cLook! Who\\u2019s that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cPikachu.\\u201d I say, yes. Pikachu is wearing a little hat with a small tiny delicate chain from the center of the hat down and there\\u2019s a hook on the end of it. There\\u2019s a hole drilled into the spoon and the hook sits there nicely, so it doesn\\u2019t dangle and it\\u2019s actually part of Pikachu\\u2019s hat. So I purchase the spoon and we put it in our backpack. Now I\\u2019m thinking we have to spread these towels. Now I\\u2019m wondering if we\\u2019re staying here and I\\u2019m starting to get a little bit nervous because it is getting dark. We don\\u2019t appear to be leaving in the vehicle and I haven\\u2019t arranged for us anywhere to sleep. So we\\u2019re back up on street level and I\\u2019m walking to where we entered this level. But then I see that more people are walking that way and I see the vehicle. We get in the vehicle and sleep on it. Nice passes really quickly, then we exit back out at daytime. This time I have both my son and daughter. My daughter is older than my son. I\\u2019m bringing them with me to a house that I\\u2019ve prearranged to meet someone in - someone I had forgotten that I met on the first voyage there. So we do this. We\\u2019re not on the bicycle this time, we\\u2019re just walking. We get to the house and there\\u2019s a library upstairs. So I take my kids up to the third floor and they\\u2019re in the library. Then I walk back to the first floor to meet the person I\\u2019m supposed to be studying the language with. It\\u2019s someone I feel I\\u2019ve met before - there\\u2019s some familiarity about the man. We sit at a table and he\\u2019s teaching me a word and I\\u2019m repeating it - that\\u2019s how I\\u2019m learning, back and forth rote memory style. Then I ask him, \\u201cIs there a washing machine here? I still have these things from the picnic and I need to wash and dry them. They are muddy and wet.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, there\\u2019s one in the basement. Help yourself.\\u201d So I take everything down, load the washing machine, put soap in it, and come back upstairs. Then I realize I\\u2019ve put my muddy pants in there and I\\u2019m just wearing my underwear and the shirt I had on underneath. I ask him if there\\u2019s anything I can borrow. He says, yes. He hands me a pair of pajama bottoms. So I wear those and we continue the language lesson. We continue for a bit longer, then I go back downstairs to switch the laundry and put things in the dryer. I come back up the stairs. This time, there\\u2019s a second person in there for a language lesson. I also recognize him - he\\u2019s a colleague. So now the first man I was learning from is tutoring someone else and I\\u2019m practicing the language with my colleague, Keith. We both have a test coming up and we\\u2019re studying together practicing this language. The first man who is the tutor comes back into the room with Keith and me. He says the time is up. Keith leaves. I go back and get our laundry and put in our packs. I thank the man for his time. My kids have come downstairs from the library and we get our packs. I never take the test. We just get back in the vehicle and leave. There\\u2019s one more layer where I come back. I exit the same vehicle into a landscape with the same kind of architecture. This time I don\\u2019t have my kids. I walk to the place where I had picnicked with my son. I\\u2019m taking my time. It\\u2019s a nice day. The weather is temperate - not too hot, not too cold. I\\u2019m not swimming. I\\u2019m just lying on the grass in meditation, looking at the clear blue sky. I rest there for some time. It feels really good. The day is only half gone and the vehicle isn\\u2019t coming back until the end of the day. So I still have half a day to spend. I don\\u2019t want to stay by the beach anymore. So I walk back through the small town. I\\u2019m not feeling particularly hungry. I end up at the house where I had studied before. Before I go in, I see the same man that had tutored me. There\\u2019s still a nagging question in my mind about where I had seen him before. He waves over to me and indicates that I should come in even though I don\\u2019t have an appointment. We go back into the room where I had the tutoring session before. He indicates with his hand that I should sit down. So I do. Only this time he has a plate of food. He divides it into two and pushes one plate over to me and keeps the other plate for himself. I\\u2019m eating this really, really slowly, trying to figure out the flavors. I don't even know what the food pieces are. So I\\u2019m eating slowly and thinking about it. He hands me this other thing. It is the size of a potato, but not as hard as a raw potato. It feels like a thick, doughy thing. I wonder what it is. He indicates that I should dip it into the food, then take a bite. So I do. It tastes somewhat bread like, but doughier. I still don\\u2019t understand the spices. Actually I don\\u2019t like the texture of it. After the first bite, I set it back down and continue to eat the food with my fingers. Then I wish I had the spoon I bought last time and gave to my son. Then he gets up and indicates for me to look at my legs. I see that my pants are all muddy again. He asks me in the language if I want to use the washing machine. I say yes. Then I stand there for a second. He takes that same soft pajama-like thing out of the door and hands it to me. So I go back downstairs to where the laundry is and I take the rest of the things from my pack because they aren\\u2019t clean either. I put everything into the washing machine and come back up with the soft clothing on. Now he\\u2019s sitting down on the floor. There\\u2019s something on the television, which I hadn\\u2019t noticed was there. I sit down on the floor beside him. I don\\u2019t understand the language that the people on the tv are using. So I kind of drift off and am daydreaming. I am just waiting for the laundry to finish. He comes over a little closer to me and I feel that there\\u2019s some kind of sexual energy between us. Then I suddenly remember who he is. He\\u2019s someone I had tea with on a meetup - I was just meeting him, but we never went on a date. But there\\u2019s energy there. He just brushes down my arm, down the side of my leg with his hand, like he is testing to see where this is going to go. I do feel my body respond - it\\u2019s warm. But I don\\u2019t really want to engage with him that way. I still acknowledge that it felt nice, though. He backs away, but doesn't go too far. He seems content with just acknowledging that the energy is there but not taking it any further. Then we move closer to each other again and just stay there, touching, until I think my laundry is done. Then I go to the basement, get the laundry, change and give him back the pajamas he lent me and go out the door to the vehicle to fly off somewhere.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Photo Chest\\u201d I\\u2019m walking across a really long bridge. It feels a little bit cold and windy and as though I\\u2019m walking against the wind and uphill. The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that\\u2019s been empty for a few years. It\\u2019s where my daughter\\u2019s grandparents used to live. They\\u2019ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter\\u2019s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It\\u2019s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It\\u2019s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There\\u2019s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There\\u2019s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It\\u2019s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There\\u2019s one point where I\\u2019m a little bit surprised at Roberta\\u2019s description. They aren\\u2019t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter\\u2019s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There\\u2019s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it\\u2019s her because her face doesn\\u2019t really change. She\\u2019s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I\\u2019d never heard of this woman before. I\\u2019m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn\\u2019t aware of. We just pass the day looking through all these generations of mostly women in the photographs. It was lovely.\"],[\"\\u201cPieces of I.D.\\u201d I\\u2019m in something that feels like the shape of an orchestra pit. It\\u2019s quite crowded with people. A few of the people are sitting in front of drafting boards. The drafting boards take up a lot of room - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019re almost side to side. There are more people than drafting boards, so the excess people make it feel really packed. I feel like I have some kind of amnesia as I sit in front of my drafting board. I don\\u2019t know what I'm supposed to be drawing. So I start to circulate amongst the people. It\\u2019s all hazy. I don\\u2019t know anyone, I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to draw. I\\u2019m approaching some of the people. I\\u2019m climbing over other people that are just sitting there. It\\u2019s literally packed with people. I\\u2019m hearing rather than seeing that some people are involved in a conversation with their drafting board. I realize that even though you can\\u2019t really see what they\\u2019ve drawn, the conversation they are having with it is they are telling it their life story, but there are too many details to draw. So there\\u2019s another kind of media that produces an imprint on the drafting board, the person who is the architect of their life. Then I have some kind of idea of what is supposed to be on mine and I make my way back to it, but then I can\\u2019t remember what I\\u2019m supposed to put on it. I know there\\u2019s a conversation, but I don\\u2019t have enough of an idea of what mine is in order to begin the conversation that will imprint upon my drafting board. So in an effort to discover more detail, I leave the orchestra pit adn I start to walk towards a building. I realize the building is a hospital. I enter in the front door. I decide to get on the elevator and go up. I don\\u2019t press any buttons; the elevator moves on its own accord. It stops at a floor and I get off. It\\u2019s some kind of surgery and recovery floor. I wander around for a bit. There are some nurses and other staff around but I don\\u2019t engage with them. Then I get back on the elevator. This time it goes down. I get off. I didn't find anything that gave me any inspiration either to remember or tell my story. So I wander out the front door. Instead of going back to the pit, I walk through the street. I look to see if there\\u2019s anything that sparks any memory. It\\u2019s an urban street with all kinds of people. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are vendors and street artists drawing. At one point I get tired of walking and so I sit down on a bench. The bench is not parallel to the street. It\\u2019s perpendicular to the street, around the side of the building. I sit there just resting. A man was sitting there the whole time, but I didn\\u2019t see him. Now that my eyes have adjusted, I start to see him. I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll just stay there and be quiet. But he doesn\\u2019t. He starts trying to engage with me and talk with me. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. In fact he seems kind of abrasive and now he\\u2019s in my space. Instead of sitting on his own bench, he\\u2019s now come up beside me. I feel slightly threatened by his presence. I reach into my pockets, make two fists and shove them into my pockets. I feel something in my right hand and it\\u2019s three cards - they feel plastic, like credit cards. I pull them out and I look at them. It\\u2019s my identification. One is a driver's license. One is a bank card. The other one I think is a social insurance card. They have my name on them. My driver\\u2019s license even has a picture of me. I suddenly remember who I am. I\\u2019m afraid the man is going to steal them even though they aren't worth any money. I think he might take my ID. So, I put them back in my pocket. It looks like he hasn\\u2019t seen them, so I\\u2019m thinking this is good. I stand up slowly and walk away. I turn right, trying to remember where I live. I walk up the street. I see with some dismay, my ex-husband. My first instinct is to turn around and go the other way. But I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, he probably knows where I live.\\u201d I decide to tackle this anyway. As I walk through the crowd of people, he recognizes me and looks up. I stop in front of him. But I don\\u2019t want him to know that I can\\u2019t remember where I live. So as I approach and slow my pace, I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll say something to me first. He does. He asks me where I\\u2019m going. I say I\\u2019m heading home. He says, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I wait, hoping he\\u2019ll give me some clue where that is. He doesn\\u2019t say anything. Then he says, \\u201cJust a second. I\\u2019m trying to load up these bags.\\u201d I look down and he\\u2019s got shopping bags. He has a lot of stuff that he\\u2019s trying to put inside of them. It looks to me like he doesn\\u2019t have enough bags. He keeps putting things in, then taking them out, trying to reorganize them in an effort to fit everything. Then he hands me the bags and says, \\u201cCan you do this?\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer, but I just start to organize. Then he wanders off. I'm just organizing his stuff in the bags and I\\u2019m actually making it all fit. It reminds me of packing to go places when we were married and how he would say things didn\\u2019t fit in the car, and I would go and fit it in. It reminded me that I always had to do stuff for him. I\\u2019m slightly irritated that here I am back on the street and trying to find my way home, and here I am waylaid by trying to put his stuff in his bags. Then I focus again on the task. A woman comes up and asks if any of this is for sale. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not mine.\\u201d But as I look at the bags, I see one has some of my stuff in it and am wondering what it is. It\\u2019s CD\\u2019s. So I look at them and wonder why he has all my CD\\u2019s. As I\\u2019m wondering this he arrives and says, \\u201cOh, I see you\\u2019re finished. It all fit. This is good. Let\\u2019s go now. Why don\\u2019t you take that bag? I\\u2019ll take the rest.\\u201d It\\u2019s the one with my own CD\\u2019s in it. I decide to ask him, \\u201cDo you know where these belong?\\u201d and I indicate the bag of CD\\u2019s. He says, yes. I say, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust up the street a couple blocks.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh, good. He knows where I live.\\u201d So I decide that\\u2019s good. Then I ask, \\u201cDo you know where the rest of my purse is? I\\u2019ve only got these three pieces of ID.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s in one of those bags.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Barge\\u201d A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It\\u2019s quite intricate and detailed. I\\u2019m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don\\u2019t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we\\u2019re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I\\u2019ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I\\u2019m just standing there. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m at a really large lake or an ocean. I\\u2019m just watching. I\\u2019m looking at the water. You can\\u2019t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It\\u2019s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It\\u2019s also very balmy and a bit windy. I\\u2019m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It\\u2019s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They\\u2019re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I\\u2019m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I\\u2019m being told that it\\u2019s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it\\u2019s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we\\u2019re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I\\u2019m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I\\u2019m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don\\u2019t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I\\u2019ve been with before. I don\\u2019t try to join them because they\\u2019re in a family grouping. There\\u2019s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don\\u2019t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I\\u2019ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what\\u2019s there. There are muffins. But I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re gluten-free and I know I can\\u2019t eat wheat, so I don\\u2019t get them. There\\u2019s something else on the table. I\\u2019m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she\\u2019s too short and can\\u2019t reach it. I\\u2019m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, \\u201cMy mom said I can have one.\\u201d So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, \\u201cJust a minute, let\\u2019s find your parents.\\u201d She points further up the pier and says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re over there.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t see anybody. She\\u2019s fairly determined and tugging me. We\\u2019re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It\\u2019s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, \\u201cOh look! It\\u2019s garbage day.\\u201d So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It\\u2019s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I\\u2019m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there\\u2019s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it\\u2019s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that\\u2019s on the pier. I think. \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d The post is still standing. I think that\\u2019s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, \\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they\\u2019re supposed to be here. He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see anyone.\\u201d I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there\\u2019s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they\\u2019ve all been in this trauma but she\\u2019s not going to go because she\\u2019s not ready. Now I\\u2019m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I\\u2019m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I\\u2019ve got my laptop with me and I don\\u2019t want to take it. I say to her, \\u201cIs it okay if I leave this in your room?\\u201d She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I\\u2019m getting into a Jeep. It\\u2019s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they\\u2019re all cut out for open air. So I\\u2019m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it\\u2019s cleared out and doesn\\u2019t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There\\u2019s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they\\u2019re with. I don\\u2019t have a \\u201cwhoever I\\u2019m with\\u201d so I don\\u2019t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. You can\\u2019t see the sun overhead, though. There\\u2019s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It\\u2019s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don\\u2019t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven\\u2019t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don\\u2019t know what time we\\u2019re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don\\u2019t see any. At one point the day feels like it\\u2019s gone on. I am hungry but I don\\u2019t have any food. I\\u2019m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren\\u2019t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I\\u2019m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I\\u2019m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they\\u2019re having together and they don\\u2019t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I\\u2019m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I\\u2019m looking for staff to help me. I\\u2019m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I\\u2019m going to miss supper as well. I\\u2019ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Reunion\\u201d I\\u2019m invited to some kind of gathering, I don\\u2019t know what the purpose is, except that I feel I should go. I have a little hesitancy about this because it\\u2019s enough of a drive for me that I\\u2019m thinking that by the time I get there, I\\u2019m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I\\u2019m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there\\u2019s a bottle of wine - there\\u2019s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I\\u2019ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I\\u2019ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don\\u2019t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there\\u2019s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar\\u2019s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He\\u2019s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, \\u201cit\\u2019s been a long time.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes it has.\\u201d We sit down next to each other and we\\u2019re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we\\u2019re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I\\u2019m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don\\u2019t know. So I\\u2019m not very happy about this. She\\u2019s apparently acting as though she\\u2019s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She\\u2019s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there\\u2019s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven\\u2019t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself from the table and go find my bags and give them to the hostess. When I get back from doing that though, more people have left their seats. I\\u2019m kind of relieved. I didn\\u2019t eat very much, but at least I\\u2019m not stranded in this awkward and ingenuous conversation with the woman. I realize that there\\u2019s been a gift for each of the people at their seats. They didn\\u2019t even notice it. The hostess is a little bit distressed about this - the fact that no one brought anything with them and that no one has noticed that there\\u2019s gifts at the table for each of them, and furthermore that people came and brought their toddlers and kids and left them unsupervised running all over the house. Basically what\\u2019s happened is the guests have been quite oblivious as guests and taken way more latitude than was offered and the house is trashed. Everything is everywhere. The guests have all left. They haven\\u2019t even taken their plates from the table. It\\u2019s just a mess. So I just start cleaning up. I\\u2019m helping by clearing the table and doing dishes. I make a point of thanking the hostess for my gift, which is a pair of silver candleholders that are like the Kokopeli character and they look like they were fashioned in Mexico. I thank her for her thoughtfulness. There\\u2019s also a gingerbread kit where the pieces of gingerbread are wrapped up in saran wrap. You would make your own icing and put them together. It\\u2019s a little mini house. As I\\u2019m thanking her, she\\u2019s enough upset that no one else did, that my words kind of fall around her like they\\u2019re unprocessed by her. She goes down into the basement. I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing down there. I am still cleaning upstairs. I continue helping with the dishes. There are a couple other of her family members - her two kids are helping. The dishes basically get done, but it takes a little while. I go into another room where the toddlers have trashed it. Omar is there. We gaze at each other. I feel his eyes. He beckons to me. He wants me to lie down with him. I say, \\u201cNo, I can\\u2019t do that. There are people and toddlers and stuff here.\\u201d We go upstairs. He\\u2019s cleaning, too, that\\u2019s what he was doing in the other room. We go upstairs and these kids have taken all the clothes out of the dresser. As I\\u2019m picking and folding clothes up, there\\u2019s a dirty diaper on the floor. We are tidying all of this up and trying to make their house right.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Drew\\u2019s\\u201d I am staying with a large family and they live in a house with many rooms. The backyard has a pool. The property extends back beyond a cedar hedge, which is as tall as the house, into another property behind it that has an old cottage on it. There's another old cottage behind that one. I have a room up on the second floor. It\\u2019s a bedroom. On this particular day, we are gathering in the pool. It\\u2019s a warm pool and the waters have some kind of healing property to them. The patriarch of the family is getting old and he has arthritis in his hips. He has trouble getting down the stairs, through the house, and then lowering himself into the pool. He\\u2019s also quite overweight and it makes the arthritis in the hips even worse. However, he does manage to get into the pool and he\\u2019s just soaking in it. There\\u2019s a conversation that begins to occur about whether or not everybody should stay in that house because the mobility issues. Alos, there are several people, including me, that are staying there. One person is helping clean. She\\u2019s sleeping on a bench with a cushion on it in the kitchen. She doesn\\u2019t have a room of her own. There are two other people aside from her that also don\\u2019t have actual rooms. While this discussion is occuring in the spa pool. I\\u2019m thinking that if we just rearrange the rooms a little bit with who\\u2019s sleeping where, there would be room for everyone and everyone would have a bed. It might be better not to move because moves are disruptive and the next house is going to have similar problems as this one, unless it\\u2019s possible to find a low ranch style home. So I voice my suggestion. So some people move downstairs and other people from the kitchen move up to the top floor. The patriarch doesn\\u2019t have to climb any stairs. This way when we do the shuffle, there is room for everyone, including the people sleeping in the kitchen. The family agrees this is a good idea. After the pool, we go into the house to tell the girl that\\u2019s been sleeping in the kitchen. At that point, it comes out that the matriarch is the owner of the cottage at the back of the property. She\\u2019s been wanting to use her own cottage anyway. So she takes this shuffle as an opportunity to occupy her own cottage, which she\\u2019s happy about. Some of the family members are a little bit surprised that she\\u2019s already been sleeping in it, but they agree. I\\u2019m now down on the main floor, too. I put some things together in a bag because we have to go out to do laundry. I leave the house and go to my friend\\u2019s apartment building. There\\u2019s a line for the washing machine and the dryer. I wait. I go back up to his apartment, spend some time with his daughter, then go back down to check. This time I can put my laundry in. So I empty it out of the garbage bag. On the way back up to the apartment, there\\u2019s a strange man I find in the hallway. He asks me if I want some carrots. I don\\u2019t really know where I\\u2019m going to put them. I tell him I don\\u2019t have room for them right now. He says, \\u201cOkay, well I\\u2019ll find you later.\\u201d I go into the apartment. My friend\\u2019s daughter is still alone. So I\\u2019m playing a game with her and there\\u2019s a knock on the door. I open the door and it\\u2019s my friend. He kind of falls into the apartment. I wonder why he is knocking and not using his own key. I excuse myself and go back down to switch the laundry around. While I\\u2019m doing this, there\\u2019s a little bit of a fight in the laundry room and there are a couple of women that have been there since the beginning. They only want to use the dyers that they think they can use. They aren't letting other people use them. But I climb up on the table and put my stuff in the empty one later. They kind of give me a dirty look and huff off. While my laundry is in the dryer, the man comes in and gives me two carrots from the garden. He wants me to come out and look at the garden. It\\u2019s a community garden. I do, but I tell him I can only stay for a minute because I need to get my stuff out of the dryer as soon as it\\u2019s dry because there are two women in there who are going to probably pull it out and do something with it. While I\\u2019m outside and looking at the community garden, my phone rings. It\\u2019s my friend and he\\u2019s upstairs in the apartment. He tells me that I need to get back up there right away because there\\u2019s some kind of plot to oust him from the apartment. It\\u2019s something he hasn't done, but it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s fault - his name is Craig. He wants me to position myself on Craig\\u2019s floor and light a match because the draft that comes underneath his door will put the match out just at the right time and then the building supervisor will know it\\u2019s Craig\\u2019s fault and not my friend\\u2019s. I tell him I have to get the laundry first. So I run back into the laundry room. The two angry women are there and involved in some kind of fight with some other women. I get my laundry out and I rescue my suitcase from underneath the door to the laundry room and I put everything in it. I rush back upstairs onto the hallway where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I see my friend is coming out of the upper floor as I\\u2019m rushing in. I say, \\u201cOh, I was just putting myself in position there.\\u201d He says, \\u201cAh, it\\u2019s okay. I got somebody else to do it.\\u201d I just take my stuff up and put it in his apartment and wait there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Seven Centres\\u201d This dream starts at a wedding reception. I\\u2019m there with my daughter and my daughter's boyfriend. The reception probably holds about 50-60 people. The hall is big enough that it doesn\\u2019t feel crowded. There\\u2019s a certain amount of space between people. In fact, we are sitting at our own table. The table is bigger. There are lots of empty chairs. No one else is supposed to be sitting there. There are only three place settings - mine, my daughter\\u2019s and her guest. I\\u2019ve taken some time to do my hair before I go out. I\\u2019m wearing a silver tiara. It\\u2019s not fancy, it just wraps like a headband made of malleable silver wire. I\\u2019m using it to keep the hair from falling in front of my eyes if I tilt my head forward. I also have a multi-strand silver bracelet on my left wrist with tiny stones in it - they are opalesce in appearance. I\\u2019m wearing a light blue dress and it feels really good on my body. We\\u2019re having a conversation at the table. I excuse myself for a moment to use the restroom. On my way to the hall, this man comes up behind me. He\\u2019s fairly boisterous. I don't turn around to look at him. He\\u2019s trying to exert himself into my consciousness. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. After I come out of the restroom, I see him again. He\\u2019s sitting at a table with some other people. Again, he\\u2019s boisterous and loud, so he\\u2019s distracting. When i return to the table with my daughter and her boyfriend, he comes to sit with us. He\\u2019s trying to sell all of us on this idea that he makes some kind of chart that explores people\\u2019s personalities and lends them insights into themselves. I listen to him for a few minutes then decline his services. However, he leaves his business card. I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s located in Lindsay, a town I\\u2019m familiar with and know that I\\u2019m going to be visiting some time in the future. We finish our meal, the plates are taken away, and we are encouraged to stand up as the staff moves the table away to allow for dancing. We\\u2019re dancing as the same units as the table seating was arranged in. at one point, that same man comes up and just begins dancing. He\\u2019s fairly physical - really getting in my space and standing behind me and pressing his body up against mine and dancing with me. Then he leaves. There\\u2019s a point where the dance just goes on and on. It\\u2019s a lot of shaking, like ecstatic dance. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember the dance ending and us ending up at home in our beds. So when I wake up in the dream, I think, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really strange that we danced ourselves into this non-remembering place. I wonder how we got home?\\u201d We are home. Then I notice that the bracelet I had around my wrist is now in my hair. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a good idea, using it to tie the rest of my hair back so I can dance.\\u201d I go and look at it in the mirror and think, \\u201cOh, it even looks good. I like the way it looks.\\u201d When I leave the bathroom, I walk down the hall and notice that I am in the physical house of my step grandmother. I remember that there\\u2019s something I\\u2019m supposed to do when I\\u2019m here. I need to meet some of the people that were at the wedding reception the previous night. So, I organize myself. I get some breakfast. I have a shower and change my clothes. My daughter and her boyfriend don\\u2019t have to do these errands, so they\\u2019re staying in the living room. They\\u2019re occupied with some other activities. When I leave to go out the front door - it is winter time in the dream - I lock myself out. In order for my step-grandma to know I\\u2019m there and we\\u2019re in the house, I move one of the bricks from the garden and put it at the front door. Then I walk across the street to the neighbor\\u2019s house who is usually always home. They know each other. I knock on the door, she comes out and I tell her what I\\u2019ve done. She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I actually have a key. I\\u2019ll just let you in.\\u201d She walks back across the street with me, we open the door, I make sure it\\u2019s not locked this time, and say goodbye to her. She returns to her own house. I walk up the street. I turn right and I go to visit someone who still lives there. There are a number of family members standing in the driveway, having a conversation. I speak to the matriarch of the family and give her a hug. We have a conversation about what everyone is doing. After this conversation is over, I continue back up the street. There\\u2019s a little girl heading towards me. She\\u2019s only about two. I\\u2019m thinking she should not be out in the winter, she doesn\\u2019t even have a winter coat on. But I turn around and one of the people from the driveway exclaims, \\u201cOh, what are you doing? You\\u2019re supposed to still be in the house!\\u201d I realize it\\u2019s her own daughter. She goes up the street, picks up the little girl and is holding her. She says, \\u201cOh, I remember you. The last time I saw you, I was only 9 and you were with Daren\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh yes, I remember you.\\u201d I call her by name. She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s right. Why don\\u2019t you come in for a visit?\\u201d I agree to do that and tell her that I can only stay for a few minutes. We go into her house. It\\u2019s the house she grew up in and now it belongs to just her. She sets the little girl down, brushes her off and does the mom fingers through her hair thing. The little girl goes off to play. We sit down for a few minutes and she tells me what she\\u2019s doing. As we start to finish this conversation, another woman comes into the house whom I recognize, but I know she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. She\\u2019s lost a lot of weight and her face really looks different. I call her by name and she looks at me puzzled. I tell her who I am. She\\u2019s Daren\\u2019s youngest sister. She says, \\u201cOh, I really don't remember you, but I remember everybody else talking about you.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a bad thing. She just knows me from conversations but doesn\\u2019t remember me visually. We have a conversation. Then I tell her I have to get going and I have these errands to run. She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll walk with you. I\\u2019m going the same direction.\\u201d She tells me where she\\u2019s going and it\\u2019s the same man\\u2019s place with the business card. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, really? I\\u2019m surprised that anyone is interested in this.\\u201d She describes it as being very popular and he\\u2019s well-respected in this area where they all live. I think, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s on the way, maybe I\\u2019ll stop and see where his office is.\\u201d So, we do this. It\\u2019s snowing out. It\\u2019s really nice. I can feel the flakes landing on my face. It\\u2019s so cooling. Everything is just covered with this white magical veil. It\\u2019s just gorgeous. We walk to the end of the street and into this man\\u2019s office. It\\u2019s painted on the door. It looks like one of those 1940 detective show movies with the door with glass on top and name painted on the top like an arc and it has the \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d underneath. So, his name is painted in the shape of a rainbow. \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d is written vertically down and he\\u2019s got a picture of himself there. I\\u2019m laughing to myself because he\\u2019s wearing a turban and looks like a fake fortune teller. But there are other people waiting in line to see him and I\\u2019m astonished that people think this guy knows the future and all these deep secrets about them. I just can\\u2019t believe it. I also note that it\\u2019s progressed from the guy at the wedding reception handing out business cards, jollying it up with everyone, to now wearing a turban. His hair was short and grey. So the idea that he even needs a turban is ludicrous. So now I know where his office is and say goodbye to Daren\\u2019s sister. I carry on for my own errands. I go into a few shops. I\\u2019m just picking up small supplies. I go into a cheese shop and get a little tiny bit of cheese. I go into a meat shop and get a little bit of meat. Then I stop and get a few vegetables and fruit at the market. So I've got two bags in my arms and am walking back through the snow lined streets. There are no cars and nobody else walking. I can hear my feet crunching against the snow. I arrive back at my step-grandmother\\u2019s house. My daughter and her boyfriend are still in the living room. He\\u2019s doing something on a laptop and she\\u2019s doing something on a handheld device. I tell them that they need to come in and help prepare the food. I set it down and notice on the clock that there\\u2019s still two hours before we need to eat. I feel like I want to do something to keep occupied, but I don\\u2019t have anything else with me and it\\u2019s not my house. So, I go into the living room and sit down even though I know they\\u2019re both absorbed by their activities and me sitting there talking with them is not going to be welcomed. However, my daughter says to me, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you tell Joe what your dreams have been and he\\u2019ll record them on his laptop?\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cwhy would I do this? I already have my own dream journal at home?\\u201d But she\\u2019s looking at me the way you try to silently tell someone with your eyes: go, go, do it! So, I\\u2019m like okay, I guess this is meaningful, I\\u2019ll do it. So I say, \\u201cHey, do you want to record one of my dreams?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, sure.\\u201d I tell him this particular dream and I know it's\\u2019 got a number of parts to it. I peak over to see what he\\u2019s writing. He\\u2019s written two paragraphs and they\\u2019re not as detailed as I\\u2019m telling him. What\\u2019s fascinating is there\\u2019s a part on the screen where the words are turning into characters. So, for example, one of the words describing the wedding with the people seated around, but not saying anything are now flying but don\\u2019t have mouths. Some of the words are different colors. I look and I say, \\u201cOh my goodness! This is dream software. It\\u2019s animating my dream story!\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, isn\\u2019t it cool?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, this really is!\\u201d I ask him what it\\u2019s called and he tells me, but I don\\u2019t remember when I woke up. Then, he stops writing and he\\u2019s distracted and patting the cat\\u2019s head. He\\u2019s just recording this a lot more slowly than I can possibly speak. I feel myself getting a little frustrated that I want to get up and move, even though I\\u2019m fascinated by this software, I want to do something else while he\\u2019s not typing. So I get up and go into the kitchen. My daughter says, \\u201cDo you want him to finish or not?\\u201d I feel there\\u2019s an internal cognitive dissonance between wanting to finish and not wanting to sit there for the length of time it takes to do this. While I\\u2019m experiencing this cognitive dissonance, he gets tired of waiting for me to reply, leaves his chair and goes upstairs. Now I\\u2019m in the kitchen and thinking I might as well start prepping the vegetables. While I\\u2019m doing this, the doorbell rings and it\\u2019s this same man though he\\u2019s wearing a turban this time! He comes into the house and sits down in the living room. To my dismay, I see he\\u2019s already got my daughter sucked into his diagram of what he knows about her psyche and what he can predict from it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUgh!\\u201d So I think I should sit down and make sure I hear what he\\u2019s telling her so I can protect her from his lies. As I\\u2019m listening to him, I realize he\\u2019s using some points that have some validation in the world of psychology. I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s what he uses as a hook to get people to believe his ludicrous claims. And then he\\u2019s also using the same colors of the chakras from yoga and saying these are the 7 energetic centres that he works with. So he\\u2019s taken something from academic psychology and some hokey stuff and woven it through the chakras, but made himself the carrier of this information, so people have to pay him and go to his centre in order to receive his wisdom that actually isn\\u2019t even his, but something he\\u2019s whipped up from other people\\u2019s work.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Chandelier\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of building. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m teaching a teacher training, but it\\u2019s really different. The training is to help people connect to and expand their senses so that they have an expanded experience in their daily lives. I\\u2019m really enjoying using plants, food and light in the training. I\\u2019m fascinated by the process, actually. I teach every other weekend. On this particular weekend in May, May 23, I\\u2019m not supposed to be teaching. However, I have been borrowing things to use as equipment and examples - just gathering and borrowing rather than buying things to use in the teaching. This one friend of mine, Thomas has contributed something I can use in the training. He\\u2019s dropping it off athte facility where I teach as opposed to bringing it to my house. So I have to go in on my day off to meet him there. I am surprised that the doors are open and there seems to be another school going on. I\\u2019m just a little surprised because I was expecting it to be empty. But there\\u2019s another training of some sort involving children in one room and this is the room where I normally do my training. So I wait until there\\u2019s a little bit of a break and I wave to the person who is facilitating. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I just go over here and leave some stuff in the cupboard?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s no problem. You can join in if you want to.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you. It\\u2019s my day off. I just want to quickly drop this off and then I\\u2019ll be on my way.\\u201d But Thomas is not there yet. So I end up sitting off to the side and watch what she\\u2019s teaching. I think, \\u201cWow, that's a really different approach. I love the outside the box way she\\u2019s teaching the same old thing to these students.\\u201d I feel this curiosity for and respect for her teaching method. My friend arrives. He\\u2019s got a big cardboard box in his arms and says, \\u201cI need to assemble this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, well, let\\u2019s go into one of the empty rooms so we\\u2019re not bothering anyone else.\\u201d We exit out the backdoor of the first classroom. The next room, which I also expected to be empty wasn\\u2019t. Someone is in there setting up food. It\\u2019s a break room. He sets the cardboard box on the counter that has a sink at it. I say I\\u2019ll be back in a second. I go into the first room that I left because I\\u2019ve left some bags in there. As I'm collecting them, I look out the windows and see that some of the plants I normally use have been crushed. Something has stepped on them. I\\u2019m wanting to preserve them, so I need a bucket or something I can use to dig them up and put them in so I can wash off the roots and put them in fresh soil. I ask the first teacher if she has anything. She says, \\u201cNo, but there might be something in the kitchen.\\u201d So now I\\u2019ve got the plants in my hands. I\\u2019m holding onto them and I can feel how delicate the roots are when they\\u2019re not supported with the soil. There\\u2019s a little bit of urgency for me needing to find a container for them. I go back into the break room. The woman who was setting up has got a really, really big heavy urn, like 3 feet by 2 feet. It\\u2019s some kind of elaborate tea and coffee maker. My friend is helping her set them up instead of assembling what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. She looks like she\\u2019s finished now. Everything is stacked up. I ask her if I can use one of the plastic cups for my plants and I show her that they need some support and I need to put them in soil or they\\u2019re going to die. She says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t give you one of these. They\\u2019re all counted for. If I give you one of these, then someone will have to go without a cup of tea.\\u201d She says that maybe there is something in one of the cupboards. I\\u2019m looking through the cupboards and can\\u2019t find anything yet. I\\u2019m starting to feel like my whole day off is becoming consumed by this task. I ask Thomas if he can expedite putting together what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. He seems to be getting distracted by all the other activities and people. He says, \\u201cOkay, yes. I\\u2019ll assemble it now.\\u201d I go back into the first room and show the facilitator. She is sitting and leaning against the wall while the rest of her students are busy with activities. I show her the plants and ask her if she has a container I can put them in. She reaches underneath, opens one of the cupboard doors and gets a container and gives it to me. Now I\\u2019ve got them in a container, so their leaves won\\u2019t get crushed. But I still don\\u2019t have any soil. At this point, Thomas comes out of the back door and he\\u2019s assembled what he brought. It is 5 feet wide. He\\u2019s holding it at the top kind of like someone would hold a mobile. But it\\u2019s not a mobile. It\\u2019s a light. The light is made of tiny copper wires - they\\u2019re really quite delicate and it\\u2019s beautiful. They expand outwards and then downwards. The downward links of wire are all different lengths. Every 4 or 5 inches there\\u2019s a tiny light. So it\\u2019s a very beautiful, wide light. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to get this home now that it's assembled?\\u201d He\\u2019s carrying it. Then, he asks me what it\\u2019s for. I start explaining to him. I\\u2019m feeling obligated to teach a little of what I\\u2019m using this network of light for in the training. I start telling him. One of my own students who looks like she\\u2019s just woken up from a nap comes out of another room and says, \\u201cOh, did we have school today?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, no, we don\\u2019t.\\u201d Then I see another one coming and she\\u2019s asking if she\\u2019s missed out on any content. I say, \\u201cNo I was just telling Thomas this.\\u201d Then I realize I need to stop. Now it\\u2019s turning into a day\\u2019s teaching and it\\u2019s supposed to be my day off. So I tell them, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019ll cover this next Sunday. Don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d They go back their own way. I tell Thomas, \\u201cI really need to get this home. It\\u2019s almost 3 o\\u2019clock and I want to have some time to myself.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m carrying the little plant in the container. He\\u2019s gingerly carrying the really wide delicate light chandelier. We exit the building and go into the parking lot. He\\u2019s got a motorcycle and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this safely on a motorcycle? I didn\\u2019t realize that was his mode of transportation.\\u201d I say out loud, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this light on the motorcycle?\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, it will be fine.\\u201d He puts it along the inside of the passenger seat, which has a curved arm and back. He says, \\u201cYou can just lean against it there.\\u201d I do. I swing my leg over and sit on the passenger seat. Now I\\u2019ve got the plant in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to protect it with my body. I\\u2019m trying not to crush the light. He gets on the motorcycle, starts it up and begins to drive really fast. I\\u2019m having a hard time hanging onto the plant. Now i look down and one of my cats is in my arms. He\\u2019s all tense and he\\u2019s trying to jump off. I\\u2019m terrified that he will because he\\u2019s really wiry and he\\u2019s big and I\\u2019ve got this plant in one hand. I\\u2019m afraid he\\u2019s going to get crushed on the highway. So, Thomas takes one of his hands off the handle of the bike and is also holding onto the cat. I can see the cat\\u2019s claw is cutting into his arm and he\\u2019s bleeding. I ask him, \\u201cCan we please pull over and arrange this so that the cat is being held firmly by someone and everything else is protected?\\u201d He does. I get a better grip of the cat and have the plant under the other arm. He starts the bike up again. I think, \\u201cWow, I hope I can hang onto this and everyone is okay until we get home.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cStep-Motherhood\\u201d This dream I seem to be a step-mother to two different families. It starts off and I\\u2019m actually unclear on whether I am the first group of kids\\u2019 actual mother or if I\\u2019m their stepmom, but I\\u2019ve been with them for some time. There\\u2019s three boys and a girl. We do live alone. There\\u2019s no man in the house. The boys are all teenagers and they\\u2019re very close in age, like 17, 16 and 15. The girl is a little bit younger, but also a teenager, perhaps 12 or 13. They\\u2019re all in various stages of self-sufficiency and they are aware that we need to be moving soon as I am. Then the scene switches a little bit and I\\u2019m at another house. The house is actually quite spectacular. It\\u2019s a farmhouse style that has had a lot of work done to modernize it and continue to hold its beauty. It\\u2019s not in a town, but there are a few other houses around. It feels like some other people have also chosen not to live in an urban setting and are perhaps because of their own independence, wanting to live off the land and make similar choices, they may be in the early stages of a rural community. But I don\\u2019t feel that it\\u2019s happened quite yet. You can just see that there are other landowners around. The house has a big wide decking around it so you can stand on it before entering. It also feels like it adds to the safety and the way the house is heated and cooled by night and day through this deck and the roof. It\\u2019s like a wide, deep and covered porch. The roof is tiled. The kitchen is interesting, too. There\\u2019s a fireplace in the very center. There\\u2019s a big big wide beam that splits the kitchen in half at the ceiling. The table is built to hug the fireplace and wrap around it in a C-shape. I also notice the water tank attached to the fireplace. I haven\\u2019t quite figured out how it heats the water in the kitchen, but it does. The dream begins with me. I\\u2019m at the table. There are four girls and one boy. The boy is the oldest, probably 11 or 12. The youngest girl is still a baby, maybe 1, possibly 10 or 11 months old. The mom isn\\u2019t there. I\\u2019m not clear if she died or if she left, but she\\u2019s just not there. But she must have been there recently because the youngest is really young. I\\u2019m supposed to be getting to know these kids. I\\u2019m having a hard time keeping their names straight because there are so many of them and they never sit still for very long. The dad is there at the moment. He\\u2019s asked me to bathe them. There\\u2019s a system set up with a pipe that runs up from the fireplace, across the ceiling, down into the room that\\u2019s the bathroom and into the bathtub faucet. I open up the spigot that releases some of that water and am carefully mixing the cool water with the hot water, putting my hand in there and I only fill it about 3 or 4 inches because the little girl is very young. Then I pick her up from the dinner table and take her into the bathroom. At this point, I really get to see her face. She\\u2019s this bundle of joy. She\\u2019s innocent. She\\u2019s happy - you can feel the bubbles of happiness radiating out from her body and she\\u2019s completely trusting of me. Now I can remember her name because I can feel her energy and see her face. So I take her clothes off and I set her gently in the tub and am starting to wash her. The dad comes in and checks on us. He says something to me, but I don\\u2019t know what it is, then he leaves the room. I take the little one out of the bathtub and dry her off. I wrap her in the towel and go back into the kitchen. The dad is there. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s not clearly outlined. I see that he\\u2019s at the sink washing dishes. The kids are rowdy as they sit around the table because no one is really with them and they\\u2019re finished eating. Food is still on the table. I get the next oldest daughter who is a little over 2. I take her by the hand and bring her into the bathroom. Then I put the little one back in. she\\u2019s sitting safely in the bathtub. Then I tell the next youngest one: \\u201cWe might as well get you ready so that you can have the next bath.\\u201d I see her face and she looks different from the first child. She\\u2019s quite a bit darker and has a different character. I can feel how energetically different this child is from the first one. She\\u2019s not as trusting. She\\u2019s a lot more independent. We get her sweater off and her top and her shirt and her shoes and socks. Then I think this is going to be a challenge. The bath water from the first one is still quite clear. The other one didn\\u2019t have anything on her - there were no food bits or dirt. So the bath water is still clean and I think I\\u2019ll just warm it up a little bit and add some bubbles, then put the next daughter in. I do this. Now I\\u2019ve got both of them in the bath at the same time. I\\u2019m washing the second one. The second one has hair so I\\u2019m rinsing it with clear water from the tap. I realize that now the water is going to get too deep for the baby. I take her out and wrap her in her towel again and put her on the floor beside me. I think, \\u201cOkay, how am I going to do this? There are still three more kids to have baths. Who\\u2019s going to look after the first two?\\u201d Then the dad comes in and I\\u2019m relieved. I tell him that the youngest one is finished. He takes her with him. I finish bathing the second daughter. He brings in the third one and leaves her at the door. I coax her in. She\\u2019s a little more standoffish and it\\u2019s taking some time for me to talk to her. Then the scene changes from the bathroom. I\\u2019m outside with them. I\\u2019m showing them a raised garden bed that belongs to me. So I know what\\u2019s in there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, this starts as a seed. See how it hasn\\u2019t grown up yet? It will soon if we water it and give it some sunlight.\\u201d I hand them a watering can and they pour some water on it. Then I say, \\u201cLook, this one is already grown! It already has some fronds on it.\\u201d I clip off two fronds and say, \\u201cHere, rub the leaves a little bit and then smell it.\\u201d They do. It\\u2019s lavender. They really like this and both of them are smiling now. They\\u2019re happy and engaged with the garden. I ask them if they want to bring in this and put it in the bath water. They say yes. Now they\\u2019re both excited. So we go back into the house and back into the bathroom. Now those two are bathed. I changed the water when we got back in. They\\u2019re playing happily in the bathroom with me. It\\u2019s fine. They don\\u2019t need the kind of support the 1-year-old did where you had to hold her and do everything else with one hand. They\\u2019re playing together on the bathroom floor. I change the bath water and put in fresh bubbles. I put them both in the bathtub at the same time and wash their hair. I take them out and dry them off. I\\u2019m wondering where the dad is. I go out to the kitchen. The older girl and the boy are not at the table, but the dishes have all been taken away and the table is clean. So i\\u2019m wondering where to go next with them. I go the opposite way of the bathroom. There\\u2019s a large living room with a fireplace. It\\u2019s sunken a little bit and there are bedrooms off to the side. The girls just run into their own room. I think, \\u201cOh, this is where they sleep.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m a nanny or what. I\\u2019m starting to feel more like a nanny, like a governess. So I help them put their pajamas on, put them into bed, read them a story, and say goodnight. Then I come out and the dad has put the baby to bed. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019ve got a little bit of a breather here. The older kids can bathe themselves. Then just make sure they go to bed.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, got it.\\u201d Then I go back into the bathroom because I still have to clean up from the older twos\\u2019 bathing. I pull the plug. The dad comes up behind me and gives me a big hug from the back. I can feel his heart rate and his breath. There\\u2019s heat between us. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s what this is? Am I stepmom?\\u201d I feel a little confused. The heat is really good and I can feel my body responding. I soften into him and allow this. It lasts for a moment, then he releases me and leaves the room. Then he\\u2019s gone from the house and I get the idea that he works nights. I let the older two know that the bathroom is clean and they come in and do their own thing. I\\u2019m not witness to this. Then they\\u2019re in their pajamas and are sitting in the living room. Now we\\u2019re having a conversation with my own kids from the previous family where I was mother or step-mother or nanny. They are all sitting around. My kids from the first group are older. The kids are deciding whose room is going to be whose and who has to double up. They\\u2019re having this independent conversation. It seems to be working out. Now there\\u2019s a top floor to this house overtop the living room. That\\u2019s where the rest of the bedrooms are. So they work it out. All of them go to bed up there. Now the dream speeds up in time. I am looking after all of these kids by myself. I\\u2019m making their meals, we\\u2019re doing some kind of life skills activities during the day involving the garden and teaching them how to cook. There\\u2019s water that needs to be filled up in this complex system of rainwater catchment that\\u2019s heated by the fireplace and dispersed. Some of the girls are filtering the water and putting it in quart-sized containers for drinking water. It feels as though I have done this for about 10 days, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, how long is the dad\\u2019s night shifts?\\u201d I see him one morning. The kids are all happy to see him. Now there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference between the first group of kids and the ones that were clearly his. I say to him, \\u201cHow many more night shifts do you have?\\u201d He says, two. I say, \\u201cOh good. I was really hoping for some help here.\\u201d He has a bag of photography equipment in his hand and he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s picture day.\\u201d At this point I realize we need a backdrop. I\\u2019m tasked with going to the hardware store to get one. There\\u2019s a truck and I drive to the hardware store and get out. There\\u2019s this great big huge rack of backdrops. It\\u2019s like 8 feet long and 5 feet high. I choose one and am wondering how to get it out to the door without bending it. The employee appears to help me. She says she\\u2019s already rang it through. It doesn\\u2019t seem possible, but I take it out of the rack and it goes through the door and into the truck. It just fits. I get back to the farmhouse and take it out. Now I\\u2019m tacking it to the side of the house. Now there\\u2019s a piece of stucco ceiling. We\\u2019re outside. We\\u2019re getting ready to take pictures of the kids. He thinks the younger ones are going to be difficult, but they just come up and they\\u2019re happy. He says, \\u201cHow did you get them to do that together?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well we have this garden. I\\u2019ve got a garden in the back and we\\u2019ve been growing things. They really like it.\\u201d So the kids automatically go and get the herbs I showed them. They pick their favorites and bring them over. Then, click, click, click, the pictures are all taken and it\\u2019s really easy. Then the dad is finally next. It\\u2019s his turn. He\\u2019s lying on his back with his knees bent. I say, \\u201cOh just a second. I\\u2019ve got a kit for that in my car.\\u201d I go out and get it. They are small pieces of carpet I\\u2019ve cut out especially to cushion heads and sacrums. There are just two. I tell him to lift up his head and I put one under there. Then I tell him to lift his sacrum and I put one under there. Then I\\u2019ve got something different for the background. It\\u2019s made of some kind of fabric. I\\u2019ve got a tin of thumbtacks. I\\u2019m trying to push the thumbtacks into the wall. But just as I get to the end, the first one falls out. So he gets up and tacks it, only he uses the ceiling instead of the wall. I say, \\u201cOh, how did you do that?\\u201d He shows me the end of the tack. I see that it\\u2019s one of those things to replace Christmas ornaments - they come off and you can buy a package of separate ones. He has these in the tack instead and they fit into the ceiling. So I put one on mine and it goes into the ceiling like butter. I\\u2019m surprised. It works. Just as I\\u2019m about to turn around and go back to the camera, there he is behind me and there\\u2019s all this heat. I\\u2019m not going to go into detail, but we make beautiful love. Then all these other images go through my mind. It feels like in this whole dream sequence that he\\u2019s wanted me to fit in and I do, and now there\\u2019s all this sexual energy and love released from him and between us.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Time Machine\\u201d This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There\\u2019s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house\\u2019s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it\\u2019s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I\\u2019m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it\\u2019s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, \\u201cI have to take this.\\u201d He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he\\u2019s in the kitchen, although I haven\\u2019t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He\\u2019s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, \\u201cHe left you a gift.\\u201d I feel sad. I also feel like I don\\u2019t want to be alone with her. I\\u2019m starting to wonder how I\\u2019m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I\\u2019m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I\\u2019m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there\\u2019s a really strong emotion. It\\u2019s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that\\u2019s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn\\u2019t appear and I knew it wouldn\\u2019t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I\\u2019m an adult now. I\\u2019m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it\\u2019s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don\\u2019t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I\\u2019m hoping they\\u2019ll still be there when I leave. I\\u2019m glad he still hasn\\u2019t returned to England and I\\u2019ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I\\u2019m confused because I can\\u2019t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it\\u2019s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they\\u2019re in charge: \\u201cDo you know what happened to the classrooms?\\u201d She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, \\u201cDo you know this one is out of date?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, no I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, you\\u2019ll need to go down to the office.\\u201d She tells me the number of the office and says, \\u201cYou need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They\\u2019re just saying hello and stuff and I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren\\u2019s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on asphalt in a really old town. I\\u2019m part of a play. It\\u2019s like a movie set, but it\\u2019s not a movie set, it\\u2019s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I\\u2019ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It\\u2019s white and about 12 inches square - it\\u2019s a cube. They put this in between each word. It\\u2019s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that\\u2019s describing this tells me, \\u201cYes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they\\u2019ve been forgotten.\\u201d He told me the one we\\u2019re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there\\u2019s a picnic table. We\\u2019re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we\\u2019re waiting. It\\u2019s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it\\u2019s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They\\u2019re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn\\u2019t have food, though. He has sewing. I\\u2019m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don\\u2019t even know what it is - I choose that one. I\\u2019m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it\\u2019s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we\\u2019re entering this vehicle. It\\u2019s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but I think it\\u2019s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it\\u2019s got some kind of engine - it\\u2019s not very loud; it\\u2019s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we\\u2019re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,\\u201dWe\\u2019re going out this way.\\u201d I watch them and am thinking, \\u201cOh my god! They\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d They\\u2019re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fun House\\u201d We are at a carnival. It\\u2019s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I\\u2019m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don\\u2019t really want to because I know they aren\\u2019t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they\\u2019re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she\\u2019s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that\\u2019s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I\\u2019ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They\\u2019re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She\\u2019s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it\\u2019s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We\\u2019re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there\\u2019s a door. It brings us into something we\\u2019re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We\\u2019re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don\\u2019t have the shoes on because I\\u2019m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they\\u2019re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn\\u2019t make me put the shoes on. I\\u2019m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she\\u2019s glaring at me, I also retort, \\u201cWould I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.\\u201d I think I said Christian, but I can\\u2019t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she\\u2019s moved back and I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good. Maybe she won\\u2019t bother me anymore.\\u201d On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a window, but it\\u2019s close to the ground - it\\u2019s a crawlspace. She\\u2019s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She\\u2019s looking at something on the other side. I don\\u2019t feel like crawling there. I can see that she\\u2019s jumping up and down. She\\u2019s excited about what she sees, so I\\u2019m content to sit on the other side and wait until she\\u2019s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it\\u2019s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she\\u2019s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It\\u2019s dark. We don\\u2019t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it\\u2019s dissonant. It\\u2019s really unpleasant. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.\\u201d So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it\\u2019s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he\\u2019s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She\\u2019s a naturopath. She\\u2019s there with Trisha. i wonder what they\\u2019re doing because the carnival doesn\\u2019t seem like their thing. I\\u2019m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d Instead of staying on the ground, we\\u2019re suddenly transported upwards a little. I\\u2019d say we\\u2019re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They\\u2019re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they\\u2019re ants and they\\u2019re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He\\u2019s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he\\u2019s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn\\u2019t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Airport\\u201d We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I\\u2019m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I\\u2019ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian\\u2019s house and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we\\u2019ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it\\u2019s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She\\u2019s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn\\u2019t hungry and it\\u2019s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she\\u2019s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she\\u2019s done this in a bowl before she\\u2019s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband\\u2019sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it\\u2019s like glue. Some of it\\u2019s hard and some is still soft. It\\u2019s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don\\u2019t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, \\u201ceww,\\u201d when I\\u2019m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She\\u2019s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, \\u201cWhat time did the tickets say we\\u2019re supposed to be there?\\u201d She says, \\u201c5 o\\u2019clock in the morning.\\u201d But she says it in metric first, but we don\\u2019t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, \\u201cAre you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o\\u2019clock.\\u201d So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o\\u2019clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it\\u2019s almost that time. He\\u2019s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he\\u2019s getting his clothes on and I\\u2019m putting things into the suitcase. We\\u2019re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, \\u201cNope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.\\u201d Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, \\u201cOh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I\\u2019ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We\\u2019ll still be there in lots of time.\\u201d Her husband says no, I don\\u2019t want you to do that. Besides, we\\u2019re just going into the US and you don\\u2019t need passports anymore.\\u201d But I tell them, \\u201cEvery time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.\\u201d He gets out a piece of paper that\\u2019s attached to the back of his driver\\u2019s license. He says, \\u201cHere, read the fine print.\\u201d I read down and it says it\\u2019s fine to go on with just a driver\\u2019s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver\\u2019s license with me. I say, \\u201cBut my son doesn\\u2019t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, \\u201cWell now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.\\u201d But he won\\u2019t let us go. He tells us all it\\u2019s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They\\u2019re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don\\u2019t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn\\u2019t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We\\u2019re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don\\u2019t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I\\u2019m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don\\u2019t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she\\u2019s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re over at Gate such and such.\\u201d So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they\\u2019ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that\\u2019s great, although I\\u2019m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don\\u2019t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Birthday Party\\u201d I\\u2019m at a house and the occasion is my friend\\u2019s birthday. She\\u2019s 50 on this birthday, although I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s her real age. It\\u2019s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don\\u2019t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I\\u2019m looking for someone I know. I\\u2019m reluctant to go into the house. I\\u2019ve arrived there with my son. He\\u2019s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don\\u2019t know. I have an eye on him. He\\u2019s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I\\u2019m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I\\u2019m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn\\u2019t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He\\u2019s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they\\u2019ve seen him. They say, \\u201cYes, he went down that hallway.\\u201d They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He\\u2019s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he\\u2019ll get dressed and I tell him we\\u2019re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he\\u2019s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It\\u2019s not about anything I care to converse about. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are we wearing today\\u201d - flat and doesn\\u2019t feel meaningful. I sit with them for a few minutes and then go back to the washroom where my son is. He\\u2019s dressed now. I take him by the hand and we start walking down the hallway and out. I notice for the whole duration of this dream, my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. As we\\u2019re leaving her house, I see a pair of plastic shorts. They\\u2019re kind of long - they go almost down to the top of the knee. There\\u2019s a perforated line where you can rip off the last 4 inches and make them into a normal length pair of shorts. For some reason, I pick them up and I do this. I fold at the perforated line and rip off the bottom 4 inches. Then I roll them up and am looking for a bag to put them in. I notice there\\u2019s a tag on them that says Size 10. I think, \\u201cWhose are these?\\u201d Then I\\u2019m looking for my friend to give them to. I look down in my hand and suddenly I also have a birthday card. Now I feel surprised that I appear to have picked up something in her house that doesn\\u2019t belong to me - a pair of transparent plastic shorts - and now I\\u2019m going to give them to her. I don\\u2019t want to because I feel like I haven\\u2019t purchased this fairly; I\\u2019ve just picked them up and taken them. It\\u2019s not even something I would give to her. I\\u2019m looking for a place to set these down. They just disappear out of my hand. Now I\\u2019m with my son on the outside of the house. I take him by the hand and we continue on our walk. We go all the way around the block - it\\u2019s a nice walk. When we come back, there are still all these people I don\\u2019t know. I feel like I don\\u2019t belong there. I\\u2019m relieved to see her husband isn\\u2019t there. She\\u2019s sitting on the porch. I go up to tell her we\\u2019re going and maybe I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow when there aren\\u2019t so many people around. She smiles at me. I smile back. I get in the car with my son and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cOjai\\u201d The only part of the dream I remember comes after something traumatic. I\\u2019m feeling those emotions, but can\\u2019t remember what precipitated. It\\u2019s like I have some kind of amnesia that\\u2019s just gradually coming back throughout the meal I can recall in the dream. The meal is situated in Ojai where I did all my yoga teacher training. Except it\\u2019s not at the Piazza. It\\u2019s at the Casita. I\\u2019m in a large kitchen. I\\u2019m sitting at the table by myself. I\\u2019m feeling like no one wants to talk to me and if I do speak, my voice won\\u2019t be heard. I feel invalidated. The food preparation which is normally shared is not even being shared this day. The food is brought in various containers, some of which appear to be styrofoam. I feel let down by that. I feel like the lack of community preparation and resorting to calling for takeout in a non-sustainable container is showing me that this is not what I\\u2019m here for. I was here for authentic community sharing. I feel duped that the community meal is actually a takeout. Now Lana is opening up all the containers and dividing each container pretty much evenly onto 16 plates. There are quite a few containers, probably 20. She looks mindless while she\\u2019s doing this and is doing it hurriedly with her hands. Once all the plates are ready, people just come and take one. They\\u2019re not even sitting at the table. They are taking their plate and going off to some other area by themselves. I don\\u2019t go. I notice that about 10 plates are gone. Then I get mine. I didn\\u2019t even realize people had started helping themselves. So I take one and sit down at the table. My teacher sits down beside me as though he\\u2019s expecting everyone to also be at the table because he sits down right beside me the way you would sit down at a table when you\\u2019re expecting it to be full. I\\u2019m already eating my food. He\\u2019s silent. He eats a few bites then asks where everybody is. I tell him I don\\u2019t know. He seems concerned about this. He gets up and moves a little bit away, giving me some space. Then he\\u2019s looking around. What it does is it creates the feeling for me that the students are acting as a group within a group. We\\u2019re all here to learn from him. We\\u2019re all trainees. But in this scene, he\\u2019s no longer the teacher, at least not for what has happened in our network. It\\u2019s fragmented and it feels like there is some clandestine activity going on.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Curio Shop\\u201d My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I\\u2019m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It\\u2019s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can\\u2019t even see what\\u2019s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don\\u2019t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We\\u2019re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They\\u2019re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we\\u2019ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It\\u2019s purple, but it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s blue. It\\u2019s got fur all over. The fur doesn\\u2019t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there\\u2019s this creature in the store and my son\\u2019s got him. I don\\u2019t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they\\u2019re half off, they\\u2019re still really expensive and I don\\u2019t think I need a spoon that badly. I don\\u2019t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I\\u2019m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s this one.\\u201d I still think it\\u2019s expensive and say I don\\u2019t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my son?\\u201d One of the male shopkeepers says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to follow me.\\u201d So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d and it just bursts out of my body. I\\u2019m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it\\u2019s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I\\u2019m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that\\u2019s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, \\u201cNo way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!\\u201d So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, \\u201cRun! We have to get out of here!\\u201d So we start running. I don\\u2019t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We\\u2019re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can\\u2019t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s go in there. There are other people.\\u201d The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, \\u201cLet\\u2019s change our clothes, \\u201c so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He\\u2019s right there. I tell him, \\u201cYour partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can\\u2019t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.\\u201d He\\u2019s not helpful. In fact, he\\u2019s in league with the other one. So now we\\u2019re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can\\u2019t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got my son! You\\u2019re holding him and I want him back.\\u201d Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, \\u201cFine fine, okay!\\u201d He writes this phone number down. I say, \\u201cA phone number?! Are you kidding me?!\\u201d I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I\\u2019ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I\\u2019m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It\\u2019s a 10-digit number. Now I\\u2019ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It\\u2019s like 164576476470, like that. The 4\\u2019s and 7\\u2019s won\\u2019t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I\\u2019m sobbing and saying, \\u201cJust tell me where he is. Just go get him.\\u201d One of them says he\\u2019s in the basement. \\u201cThe basement of this building?!\\u201d I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m trying to get back into the dream, but I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"\\u201cJack\\u201d This is just a snippet. I am with my daughter and some other person that\\u2019s male - I think it might be Kenny - and Jack who is a friend of mine that I\\u2019ve had since elementary school and I still keep in contact with him. We\\u2019re supposed to be picking Jack up because he\\u2019s agreed to help us with something. He keeps not being where he said he would be. So the three of us are running around from spot to spot looking for him. It\\u2019s an urban setting and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are very slushy and it\\u2019s hard to get through. We\\u2019re muddy. As we get to checkpoints where we\\u2019re supposed to meet him, he\\u2019s not there. Now I\\u2019m not with my daughter. I don\\u2019t know what happened to her. In fact, Jack is supposed to be looking after her. It\\u2019s muddy what his responsibilities are and if he\\u2019s actually looking after them. The other two people are going through these convolutedWell, we don\\u2019t have his phone number.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well I do.\\u201d So I get out my cell phone and I look. Someone has changed his last name, but I know it\\u2019s his number because I know where it is in my contacts. When I press his number, what comes up is not his name, but something completely different that starts with D-H-L and then this other name. I think, \\u201cThat\\u2019s odd. How can anybody have done this in my phone?\\u201d Then I look over and I see him, but he looks like he\\u2019s sleeping. He\\u2019s oblivious to his surroundings. As I walk over to say hey what's up, he disappears. Then I go back to the other two people. We\\u2019ve been looking for him because he\\u2019s supposed to be doing something with us. I\\u2019m trying to explain that I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on here and something is going on with my phone and he\\u2019s illusive.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Night Walk\\u201d This dream starts in a house that\\u2019s mine. It\\u2019s a different kind of house - open concept. It\\u2019s two levels. There is a lot of space in the rooms. There aren\\u2019t a lot of contents in each room. I cook something for supper. It\\u2019s some kind of pasta with weird sauce. There\\u2019s this piece of chicken with breading on it. My conscious mind is thinking, \\u201cEw, I never make food like that.\\u201d The pasta is kind of dry and so is the chicken. I don\\u2019t make things with breading. I eat a little bit of supper and don\\u2019t really like it. I take about three bites and leave it. I tell my child - the child is a mixture of my son and daughter at the same time - we\\u2019re going to go for a walk after supper. It needs to be dark, so we are waiting until it gets dark. We leave out the house. I had something in my hand. The walk is down a path. We go out first through a field and then through an opening in some rocks which we go underneath. Then there is a fork and I say we need to take the path on the left. We climb up a steep ascent and navigate that. Then there\\u2019s a ridge to follow along. There\\u2019s a vista here before we climb up. Suddenly it zooms out and you can see how vast this landscape is - it\\u2019s like an escarpment and really quite beautiful. Then it zooms back in and we\\u2019re standing there. It\\u2019s a long hike. So we hike for probably half the night. I have this feeling in my body where it\\u2019s a tiny bit scary. But I have my child with me and I don\\u2019t want to communicate my own fear to my child. So I do quite well at appearing brave and courageous. The landscape is very pretty even in the night. There\\u2019s a feeling of lush. It feels Canadian with a mix of evergreen, deciduous trees. It\\u2019s cool, but not too cold or too hot. I can feel the packed dirt underneath my feet. It\\u2019s not too overgrown. It\\u2019s not a very wide path, so some of the grasses have grown into it. But you can still see the path ahead, so we aren\\u2019t night blind. There is enough light from the moon and the stars that we can see the path. So we hike and we get tired and our legs start to get a little bit sore. I say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s turn around and go back now.\\u201d So we do. We navigate exactly backwards. It\\u2019s uneventful. Nothing comes after us. There\\u2019s no need to run or hasten our pace. We arrive back at the house and I realize that whatever I had in my hand, I left there. So, my child sleeps, but I don\\u2019t. I leave the house and I meet someone else at a marina - it\\u2019s a complex of houses where people live. I\\u2019m meeting some friends there. There are lawn chairs set up in a circle. It\\u2019s an uncomfortable baby shower where people sit around in a circle talking stiffly in awkward small talk. There\\u2019s some kind of party game going on. One of the people grabs me by the hands and pulls me into the middle of the circle. I\\u2019m to stand there and grab the hands of two other people, then we lean back until there\\u2019s tension in the arms. Then that\\u2019s it. We stand back upright, let go, go back into our chairs. I wait and watch a few other people do the same kind of party trick. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhen is this thing going to be over?\\u201d One by one, people start to leave. I don\\u2019t linger. Then I\\u2019m caught by one of the people I know. She says, \\u201cCome on, we have to go visit my mom. She\\u2019s in one of these houses.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll do that.\\u201d As we enter into the house, I realize it\\u2019s another baby shower of some sort. There are bits of blue decoration - like the tissue paper kind - and blue balloons stuck to the wall. Finger foods have been set out everywhere. The mom stands up when she sees me, but then she tips over to one side. I realize that she\\u2019s had way too much to drink. In fact, she seems to have had more to drink than she seems to be aware of. She doesn\\u2019t seem to realize she\\u2019s staggering and banging into furniture. I feel compassion for her. I also hope she\\u2019ll sit down. She does. She still has this loopy unchanging happy smile on her face throughout this. It\\u2019s an unwavering expression. The rest of the people aren\\u2019t really engaging with each other. I get up and slowly back away out of the room and out the front door. I leave and go back to my house. I\\u2019m walking. It\\u2019s a fairly long walk and by the time I get there, it\\u2019s morning. My child wakes up. There\\u2019s this same dried pasta with a piece of chicken still in the pot. It\\u2019s in the exact same condition as it was the night before. Now it\\u2019s nighttime again. I tell my child that I forgot something on the walk and we need to do it again. Only this time, there\\u2019s not that same little bit of adrenaline going through my body where I feel slightly scared. We go through exactly the same steps to go on the walk. It\\u2019s dark, it\\u2019s at night. I wake up before I retrieve whatever it is that I left there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fortune Teller\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It\\u2019s summer. It\\u2019s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It\\u2019s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I\\u2019m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I\\u2019m with some friends. I can\\u2019t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt. She\\u2019s in the boat that I\\u2019m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She\\u2019s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I\\u2019ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who\\u2019s driving the boat is not me. It\\u2019s a motorboat - something I don\\u2019t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I\\u2019m hazy on one that is - it\\u2019s not water skiing, it\\u2019s not floating, I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we\\u2019re staying. I guess I\\u2019m in a motel because it\\u2019s on the ground. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I\\u2019m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It\\u2019s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it\\u2019s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There\\u2019s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it\\u2019s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I\\u2019ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there\\u2019s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They\\u2019ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that\\u2019s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she\\u2019s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she\\u2019s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she\\u2019s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that\\u2019s complete. So they\\u2019re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life\\u2019s purpose. I\\u2019m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I\\u2019m really surprised that she\\u2019s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there\\u2019s somebody ahead of me. I don\\u2019t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don\\u2019t go in with her and I haven\\u2019t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she\\u2019s advertised. I don\\u2019t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She\\u2019s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She\\u2019s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she\\u2019s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they\\u2019re laughing like, \\u201cWow! I can\\u2019t imagine myself doing this!\\u201d Or \\u201cI\\u2019m so surprised at what she said!\\u201d These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They\\u2019re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it\\u2019s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it\\u2019s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren\\u2019t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I\\u2019m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She\\u2019s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It\\u2019s a woman I know. I\\u2019m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life\\u2019s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there\\u2019s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she\\u2019s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives. She says, \\u201cWow I\\u2019ve made $350 doing this.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a \\u201cwho knew?!\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou are making this up?\\u201d She\\u2019s speaking as though she\\u2019s making it up. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Inner City\\u201d In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It\\u2019s really hot. There\\u2019s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I\\u2019m inside a building. It\\u2019s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I\\u2019m helping people. I don\\u2019t know the people I\\u2019m working with. So I\\u2019m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It\\u2019s really oddly shaped. It\\u2019s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It\\u2019s covered with sticky potato. I think it\\u2019s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there\\u2019s this big hose thing that\\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. It\\u2019s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I\\u2019m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there\\u2019s a sieve thing on it. I\\u2019m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they\\u2019re moving really fast. They\\u2019re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She\\u2019s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I\\u2019m helping. I feel like she\\u2019s centered me out as though I\\u2019m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn\\u2019t up to par. It\\u2019s a whole demeanor like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to watch you even closer.\\u201d She\\u2019s making me nervous now. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I\\u2019m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They\\u2019re trying to speed up and they\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can\\u2019t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There\\u2019s a ramp and there\\u2019s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I\\u2019ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I\\u2019m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don\\u2019t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I\\u2019m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They\\u2019re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She\\u2019s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there\\u2019s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t she put the bigger rock that\\u2019s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?\\u201d Now I notice that she\\u2019s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she\\u2019s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She\\u2019s calling the thigh bone a \\u201cfemoris\\u201d but in a sing-song type voice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cUh, no!\\u201d But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, \\u201cI wonder if they knew she was in there?\\u201d I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We\\u2019re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There\\u2019s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we\\u2019re instructed to sit back into child\\u2019s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It\\u2019s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I\\u2019m stretching and there\\u2019s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don\\u2019t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I\\u2019m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I\\u2019m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I\\u2019m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I\\u2019m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone\\u2019s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I\\u2019m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.\"],[\"\\u201cKeep it Small\\u201d There\\u2019s some kind of outdoor grouping. There\\u2019s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I\\u2019m not there to particularly attend. It\\u2019s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I\\u2019m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son\\u2019s friend\\u2019s moms, Melissa. She\\u2019s Noah\\u2019s mom. She\\u2019s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: \\u201cHere are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don\\u2019t react.\\u201d The lecturer doesn\\u2019t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, \\u201cAnd this is how you can keep it out of your face.\\u201d I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn\\u2019t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I\\u2019m asking her: \\u201cAre you buying into this? What do you think?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for some time now.\\u201d She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn\\u2019t had any \\u201caction\\u201d in quite a few months. I say, \\u201cWell, maybe that\\u2019s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you\\u2019re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That\\u2019s a good thing!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She\\u2019s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn\\u2019t anything to be outrageously happy about. I\\u2019m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that\\u2019s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn\\u2019t be able to pull so many people into this. It\\u2019s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it\\u2019s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I\\u2019m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I\\u2019m at home. I\\u2019m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it\\u2019s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I\\u2019m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I\\u2019m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I\\u2019m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I\\u2019ve got orange and blue in there now. I\\u2019m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bubble Gum Pipe\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room and people I used to work with at a restaurant while at university are gathered in this room. They\\u2019re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They\\u2019re there, too. At first I don\\u2019t notice them because they\\u2019re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we\\u2019re in this other place. They have a baby. I\\u2019m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we\\u2019re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I\\u2019m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I\\u2019m watching the skaters. I\\u2019m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She\\u2019s got a platter in her hands. It\\u2019s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She\\u2019s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It\\u2019s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she\\u2019s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I\\u2019m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don\\u2019t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don\\u2019t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: \\u201cFreya, get over here. I\\u2019ve got one for you.\\u201d So I start to walk closer to her. But I\\u2019m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it\\u2019s warm and there\\u2019s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI heat it up with taffy first.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don\\u2019t want it in my mouth. She says, \\u201cCome on. You\\u2019re coming with us.\\u201d I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, \\u201cMy dad, I need to let him know where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. He\\u2019ll be okay for a bit.\\u201d I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go see my mom and dad.\\u201d We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We\\u2019re almost at her parents\\u2019 place. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He\\u2019s going to be worried about me.\\u201d I look down and say, \\u201cOh we don\\u2019t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can\\u2019t even call him.\\u201d She says to me, \\u201cYour dad was crying when I saw him. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d Then I get more distraught. She says, \\u201cHe knows where my parents live. He\\u2019ll know where to come get you.\\u201d I think that he won\\u2019t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, \\u201cHow did we get all the way over here?!\\u201d Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman\\u2019s house. I think, \\u201cHow is this truck even making it down the side because it\\u2019s so steep?\\u201d It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I\\u2019m not going to get to my dad in time. He\\u2019s going to be gone by the time I get there because this is taking so very long. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Accident\\u201d I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There\\u2019s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There\\u2019s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it\\u2019s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There\\u2019s an image of Ken. He\\u2019s raking or something - he\\u2019s doing something to the land. I feel like I\\u2019ve just finished doing what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There\\u2019s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There\\u2019s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. I\\u2019m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I\\u2019m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it\\u2019s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she\\u2019s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I\\u2019m starting to become aware of the room I\\u2019m in. I can\\u2019t move my body. I feel like I don\\u2019t remember what happened. I see Ken. He\\u2019s in the room. He says, \\u201cYou were in an accident.\\u201d He leaves. I\\u2019m in this room in the hospital. I don\\u2019t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can\\u2019t touch my face. Ken\\u2019s wife says to me: \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay.\\u201d I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can\\u2019t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo. Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.\\u201d The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re so far away I can\\u2019t identify them. I\\u2019m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, why shouldn\\u2019t I be doing this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, this is where you had that accident.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t say anything else. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m supposed to remember something or if I\\u2019m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can\\u2019t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I\\u2019m bobbing around and thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s funny. I don\\u2019t think I know how to swim.\\u201d Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the house. I\\u2019m in a bed. Ken\\u2019s wife is standing over me and says, \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThe water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?\\u201d I feel around my face with my fingers and there\\u2019s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, just rest.\\u201d She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, \\u201cI thought we weren\\u2019t supposed to tell her.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.\\u201d I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There\\u2019s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s about time somebody told me what really happened before.\\u201d This time Ken answers. He says, \\u201cOkay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.\\u201d Then, before I wake up, I\\u2019m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I\\u2019m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Long Night\\u201d I\\u2019m riding my bike. I put a few things in my backpack. I notice that I\\u2019m wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt. It\\u2019s dark. I ride my bike all the way from one end of town to the other. The town ends. I keep riding. I come to the home of my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents. I stop there for a little bit. The mom\\u2019s sister is there, too. I feel detached from them in some way. I think they\\u2019re talking about something that\\u2019s racist. Because I\\u2019m kind of detached, they don\\u2019t really care if I\\u2019m there or not. I get back on my bicycle and leave. I keep riding. It\\u2019s still dark. I\\u2019m getting tired. Then I stop at a building. I go in. Inside are the studio owners of a place I used to teach at, but don\\u2019t anymore because of their unethical way of scheduling their staff. The building isn\\u2019t a studio though, it\\u2019s just this long building. They both appear to be busy with other tasks. The building is a long rectangle. I think I\\u2019m just there to rest. There isn\\u2019t anything in it. I\\u2019m not talking to the owners, I'm just standing there. Suddenly there\\u2019s a counter, like you\\u2019d see at a bank. They\\u2019re each on one side of the counter. A woman comes up to the counter. Now I\\u2019m on the same side as one of them. She is busy and writing in some kind of big ledger. The woman asks a question. Now I see that I have some tickets in my hand. I tell her that it\\u2019s a raffle for my son\\u2019s hockey team. She says, \\u201cOh, in that case, I\\u2019ll buy tickets.\\u201d I\\u2019m writing her name on them and then ripping them out of the booklet. I hand her the tickets and say, \\u201cHe\\u2019s also in theatre. I know it\\u2019s an odd combination - hockey and theatre.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, my son does the same thing. It\\u2019s nice to have boys who are interested in both.\\u201d We start talking together and leave. I realize I need to use the washroom. I go into the washroom and the other woman does, too. She\\u2019s in the stall next to me. I\\u2019m getting toilet paper off the roll on the wall, but it\\u2019s not really toilet paper. It\\u2019s actually thick towels. I hear her say, \\u201cDo you have any extra?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, one moment.\\u201d I\\u2019m getting some off the roll for her. It takes a little while because they are thick towels. As I turn to hand her a bunch, her face is through the wall as though the wall is made of soup, or the way it is in movies like a quantum wall. Her face, which I don\\u2019t seem to have noticed before, is very white and her hair is really thin and damp and lank. I hand her the towels and both of her hands are through the wall that partitions the stalls and she takes it. She disappears and finishes whatever she\\u2019s doing. I hear her leave. I\\u2019m standing at the sink washing my face. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to be cold because it\\u2019s getting colder as the night progresses. I get back on my bike and I\\u2019m really cold and my legs are tired. I don\\u2019t know where else there is to go. I wonder if a bus comes out this far and if I can put my bicycle on the bus. But then I look down and see that I have no purse and no wallet. I realize I can\\u2019t get on a bus. I turn my bike to go back in the opposite direction I\\u2019ve come from. I\\u2019ve come a really long way. I notice as I ride by, a platform that comes to a point like a triangle. It has asphalt on the top and a curb on either side. A girl is standing on it, as if it\\u2019s a bus stop out in the middle of nowhere. I ask her if she\\u2019s waiting for a bus. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been standing here a really, really long time and no bus has come.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think busses come out this far.\\u201d She says, \\u201cAre you going back towards town?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell let\\u2019s walk together.\\u201d I get off my bike. My legs are tired of peddling anyway. I walk beside her. We walk in silence for a really long, long time. Then I ask her if she doesn\\u2019t mind telling me which end of town she lives. She says she lives in the west end. We\\u2019re still quite a bit towards the east. I say, \\u201cOh so do I.\\u201d We have to walk all the way through town to get there. I wonder, \\u201cMaybe we can share a taxi?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have my money with me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cRight, neither do I.\\u201d We\\u2019re walking and walking. Then we get to the outskirts of town finally and I notice the sun is starting to come up. She says, \\u201cOh, I have a room here at this end. Why don\\u2019t we stop here and rest a bit.\\u201d We go in. it\\u2019s just a room in a really old house that\\u2019s seen better years. The front door opens. Inside is a really long high ceiling. There\\u2019s a couch to sit on and I immediately go to the couch and sit. There\\u2019s some kind of little table, but it\\u2019s not really a table. It\\u2019s like two wooden boxes stacked on top of each other, about one foot by one foot square, and tall. She has some things on it - little tiny containers. She says to me: \\u201cThis wallpaper has been bugging me for a really long time. I think I want to take it down.\\u201d I notice that the wall is a homemade checkerboard. She tells me the landlord did it himself. There\\u2019s a pale green paint on the wall. He\\u2019s made the checkerboard out of wallpaper and paint squares alternating. The part made of wallpaper is really interesting with white and colors - light blue and orange watercolor wash. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how he did this, or I would paint over it.\\u201d I get up from the couch to take a good look. I say, \\u201cHmm, it looks like there\\u2019s some kind of pigment in the paint that as he applied it with the roller, it was heat activated and the color pigments expanded and bled into each other.\\u201d She says, \\u201cHmm maybe you\\u2019re right.\\u201d But as I look deeper into it, I see that it\\u2019s made of a whole bunch of different scraps of wallpaper that he\\u2019s somehow laid on top of each other. There are layers and layers and layers. It looks like multicolor paint, but it\\u2019s these layers and layers of colored wallpaper scraps. Then I see that it\\u2019s only thumbtacked to the wall. I say, \\u201cLook. It\\u2019s starting to come off at the corners, so you can just take the whole thing off.\\u201d So she starts to take the thumbtacks out and puts them in the little containers on the wooden crate table. Underneath that are more colors of wallpaper and layers. She\\u2019s happy with it, but it\\u2019s the same thing underneath, so that\\u2019s interesting. As she\\u2019s doing this, a woman comes in with her young son. The young boy didn\\u2019t really look like his mom. The mom\\u2019s face was round like the moon. His head was longer and narrow. I remember thinking that he was such an interesting combination of features. He was halfway in between the washed out color of Heather and the vibrant darker color of his mom. I realize this is a daycare. The woman addresses the person I was walking with as Heather. For the first time I notice that Heather is kind of washed out. She has features, but they don\\u2019t stand out from her skin very much. It\\u2019s hard to see what she looks like. I notice she has paler skin and freckles and this pale mousy brown hair. The woman asks Heather: \\u201cDo you believe in conspiracies?\\u201d I notice that one of the checkerboards has the word, \\u201cconspiracy\\u201d written on it. Heather replies, \\u201cYes.\\u201d The woman who enters says, \\u201cGood. I\\u2019ll be back soon for my son.\\u201d Then she gets in her car. The wall of the building has disappeared. She tells me to hop in the back. The car looks like a Model-T Ford. There\\u2019s a newer model car that imitates its look with the wide panels. The car is made of wood. The back part has a little rumble seat and she indicates I should sit there. I notice the woman\\u2019s skin is a deep brown. She\\u2019s wearing a fantastical hat. Her dress is a pale mauve and it\\u2019s ethereal and floats like a Great Gatsby dress. She\\u2019s wearing round John Lennon glasses. I get in the rumble seat. She starts the car and I say, \\u201cAre you sure this car will make it?\\u201d She says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing wrong with this car at all.\\u201d She drives it through the house, which has gelatinous quantum type walls and doors. We go out to the back and there\\u2019s hay on the ground. There\\u2019s a barn, but we\\u2019re in an old urban city area, turn of the century with row houses that went up really fast to house people who worked in factories. But there\\u2019s a barn! It\\u2019s really unconducive to the rest. She says, \\u201cThis is one of the only barns left in this town.\\u201d She parks the car and we get out. The woman disappears and now I go back into the house from the back. Heather and the young boy are in the only other room in the building - it\\u2019s a kitchen. I start putting food together. I look in the cupboards. There\\u2019s something that\\u2019s corn-based, like a ground up corn. The other ingredients are really odd and I don\\u2019t think it will go together. I also notice that it\\u2019s safe for me to eat because it\\u2019s all corn-based. I start mixing something up. As I\\u2019m adding water, it turns into other ingredients. We eat. I tell them - Heather and the young boy - that it\\u2019s time for me to go now because I really need to get back to my own house. I leave. It\\u2019s warmer now and I feel a little rested. I finish the journey to my own home.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Television Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house of my daughter\\u2019s grandparents, both of whom have crossed over. The house doesn\\u2019t look exactly like the house they used to live in, but I know it\\u2019s their house. I\\u2019m in it and I can feel the air has a different quality - it\\u2019s light and has particles in it, it\\u2019s as though I am standing in front of a window and can see light streaming in with particles floating in it. It\\u2019s so light and bright. The house is empty but it feels like there\\u2019s a presence in the light. Gradually Roberta and Tom appear. They look just like they did when I met them. Tom is busy with a project. He\\u2019s making something outside - he\\u2019s building something. Roberta is inside. She\\u2019s putting something together with her hands. One of her daughters appears and she\\u2019s laughing and joking. She\\u2019s, in a loving way, mocking what her mom is doing. Then they ask me if I would be involved with this project. I ask what it is that they\\u2019re doing. They say they\\u2019re creating hairstyles for people that are going to be on the television show. I realize that there\\u2019s a producer involved that\\u2019s giving some of the instructions, but I can\\u2019t see him and they\\u2019re just making reference to him. Roberta and Tom have a lot of autonomy. Someone is just doing the filming. I agree to do part of the hairstyles. They\\u2019re putting the styles together on paper first, but not as a drawing - it\\u2019s a standout relief like you\\u2019d make a sculpture - only they\\u2019re doing it with bits and pieces of things to create a finished product that is a hairstyle. There are all kinds of stuff woven into the hairstyles as if it\\u2019s been upcycled out of bits of ribbon, yarn and human hair. It\\u2019s colorful and unique in a way that I\\u2019ve never thought of before. It\\u2019s actually coming out more like a headdress which makes sense because they are Native North American. Then Tom comes in from outside and he\\u2019s washing his hands because he\\u2019s been making some kind of vehicle, some kind of car. I don\\u2019t see what he\\u2019s doing, though. He says he\\u2019s about finished and his part is ready to go. We say that we\\u2019re ready to do the headdress. We share a meal and then the producer comes and films Tom\\u2019s part outside first. Someone else is following the prototype headdresses we created and implementing it. We\\u2019re returning the camaraderie, laughing and joking. At one point, Roberta is saying something to me and her daughter is standing right behind me and making remarks like, \\u201cOh sure sure,\\u201d really close to my ear. Roberta says, \\u201cWhat are you saying?\\u201d Her daughter won\\u2019t repeat it. I think that I don\\u2019t like being a vessel for this. Then the producer comes in and asks us if we would like to preview the movie. Everybody says yes. We go to the living room and the lights are dimmed somehow - this is weird because there are no lights in the house, only the heavily particled lightness. But it does dim so we can see a movie projected onto the wall. The opening credits go up showing the background parts that everyone did - creative direction, innovation, etc.. Then, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a screen that comes up with Tom\\u2019s car. I realize the movie is about the making of it. I\\u2019m astonished at the innovation that has been put into this vehicle. It\\u2019s similar to the headdresses we developed. His vehicle is made out of so many different things. It doesn\\u2019t look junky, though, it looks really sophisticated, polished and well integrated. In fact, you wouldn\\u2019t even know it\\u2019s a vehicle when you first look at it. There are so many different things in it. It definitely looks metal, but when you look, you can see pieces that form the finished metal but aren\\u2019t metal. They\\u2019ve got this upcycled feel to it, but in a highly sophisticated and finished product.\"],[\"\\u201cWalking the Night\\u201d In this dream, it\\u2019s dark and it\\u2019s nighttime. I am with two people; one is my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt and the other is my son\\u2019s grade 8 teacher. It\\u2019s a really odd combination of people. It\\u2019s like we just left somewhere, I don\\u2019t know where. We\\u2019re in an urban setting and we\\u2019re just walking. We\\u2019re walking in solitude. It\\u2019s a long walk. I can feel the fatigue in my legs. After a while, we get to someone\\u2019s house - it\\u2019s one of theirs, but I don\\u2019t know which one. We go in. it feels like it\\u2019s time to rest. My body says it\\u2019s time to rest, but no one is sleeping yet. Everyone is still awake. After some time of sitting on the couch, continuing not to say anything, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt wanders off and I assume she\\u2019s gone to sleep. I take this as permission to do the same. I wander around to find another room. I lie down on the bed on top of the covers. I\\u2019m almost asleep. The grade 8 teacher comes in and lies down on the covers as well. I feel she\\u2019s asleep, too. I wake up. It\\u2019s still dark and it\\u2019s still nighttime. Omar is beside me on the bed. I turn towards him and toss my arm and leg over him, so I\\u2019m hugging him as I sleep. I wake up. We\\u2019re still all there sleeping. I\\u2019m having a restless sleep. Then I just fall back to sleep. The next time I wake up, it\\u2019s morning and neither Omar nor the grade 8 teacher are awake yet. I just lie there for a little until I feel her stir. She doesn\\u2019t make any comment about Omar being there and I suddenly wonder if I\\u2019m the only one that can see him. She gets up and just fades away. I get up and I go into the kitchen. Debra is there, as are some other people. I start to wash the dishes - there\\u2019s a massive pile of them; they\\u2019re all over the kitchen counter. I reach for the plug. It\\u2019s really quite disgusting, the amount of soggy food bits as no one has emptied the plug or drain out for some time. So I have to dig around to find the plug and I\\u2019m scooping out bits of soggy food and putting it in the garbage. I wash a few dishes then someone has set up to dry them - I think it\\u2019s Debra. The pile is too big and I have to wait to wash some more, so I leave the kitchen and go down the hallway, which is now a different hallway; the house has shifted. I notice that there are animals in it. There\\u2019s a rabbit - it\\u2019s white and black - and it\\u2019s hopping around from room to room. It sees me and just stops hopping and looks at me. I wonder, \\u201cHmm, it doesn\\u2019t seem to be afraid of me.\\u201d It\\u2019s a big rabbit. I turn around and see Disney characters or fantasy characters on top of a white bookshelf like the bookshelf I had when I was a little girl. A man that looks like a friend of mine reaches up. I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on top of the bookshelf, but he reaches up and pulls one down. I realize it\\u2019s her favorite character. He takes it into another room and I know he\\u2019s taking it to her. I stand on the bed because I want to see what the other characters are. There is a Bugs Bunny and another one that\\u2019s red and another one that\\u2019s purple. I\\u2019m starting to see that what I first thought were Disney characters are not; they\\u2019re a combination of animals and mythological creatures. Each one is very unique. I think that it's curious. I wonder who put them up there where they can\\u2019t be seen. Now I step back down from the bed and walk down the hallway to the kitchen. I finish the dishes and set them on the counter. Now everything is clean.\"],[\"\\u201cMayoral Politic\\u201d This dream is more of a thematic than a narrative. It looked like one of those old fashioned great big signs when you enter a town where it has the mayor\\u2019s face on it, then a story about the town. It was like a threshold or portal or lived experience rather than just a great big giant sign. It looked old, too, it had an oval shape to the story, the painted picture of the mayor was in the upper left hand side. I\\u2019m looking at a description, but it\\u2019s also an entry into a town. So it\\u2019s not two-dimensional. On the description is a comparison of a mayor and the lifestyle of someone involved in a subculture and has a motorcycle. The mayor is female. She looks like she\\u2019s had a life of outdoors - there\\u2019s a sun-kissed color to her skin. She has short blonde wavy and dense hair. She looks like she would be a muscular person even though the picture only has her face. The description is like a political analysis of someone who is mayor of a town and removed from that duty that caters to the idea of mayor but stays in the office and doesn\\u2019t really interact - maybe like how clueless the aristocracy was to the plight of the common people. So it\\u2019s a comparison between mayoral duties that are detached and removed from what people need as opposed to someone who is more rebellious of that polite culture, rides a motorcycle, but is simultaneously responsive to the needs of the town and then is praised. But the praise is lie: despite the fact that there is a motorcycle, there is a number of positive qualities that the mayor has. It\\u2019s not two-dimensional in that I\\u2019m reading this. I\\u2019m feeling it as a lived experience in my body when these two descriptions are compared and contrasted. It\\u2019s like an entryway into that experience. I consider them from how my body feels about them, then decide that I would rather live in a place with a mayor that rides a motorcycle and is somewhat rebellious but responsive, than the mayor that caters to polite society but is cluelessly privileged.\"],[\"\\u201cGrapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water\\u201d This dream starts in my house. It\\u2019s not the house I currently live in; it\\u2019s not a house I\\u2019m familiar with at all. I\\u2019m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we\\u2019ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It\\u2019s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It\\u2019s beautiful. It\\u2019s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don\\u2019t say anything. We\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cYep, this is going to be good.\\u201d We go in. There\\u2019s an older woman who is taking people\\u2019s names. She\\u2019s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it\\u2019s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person\\u2019s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it\\u2019s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people\\u2019s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We\\u2019re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she\\u2019s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it\\u2019s like a black walnut dark. It\\u2019s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people\\u2019s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It\\u2019s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re standing on. I realize what they\\u2019re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life - they\\u2019re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it\\u2019s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I\\u2019m on a rollercoaster, but it\\u2019s moving through the church. I can see the track that it\\u2019s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there\\u2019s no track after that and we\\u2019re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don\\u2019t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It\\u2019s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That\\u2019s where everybody is going. So we\\u2019re new and we follow the crowd. It\\u2019s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I\\u2019ll slide backwards, but I don\\u2019t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there\\u2019s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there\\u2019s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It\\u2019s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I\\u2019m sitting in, I realize it\\u2019s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it\\u2019s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We\\u2019re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it\\u2019s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I\\u2019m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I\\u2019ve noticed that we\\u2019re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We\\u2019ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it\\u2019s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we\\u2019re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn\\u2019t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: \\u201cHave we contributed to this in some way?\\u201d So there\\u2019s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we\\u2019re just supposed to help make it or if we\\u2019ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there\\u2019s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I\\u2019m asking her if she knows where we\\u2019re supposed to be at what time. She says, \\u201cOh yes, I still have that information, it\\u2019s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven\\u2019t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you\\u2019d be back.\\u201d That\\u2019s just a memory. Then the people we\\u2019re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We\\u2019ve walked down this path from the church - it\\u2019s a dirt path that\\u2019s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren\\u2019t in an urban area. It\\u2019s like non-urbanized, but we\\u2019re not in the woods because there\\u2019s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can\\u2019t see what they are. It\\u2019s not just a dock, it\\u2019s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we\\u2019ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I\\u2019ve recently noted that he\\u2019s involved in this conspiracy group and they\\u2019re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He\\u2019s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it\\u2019s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we\\u2019re with take the cloth off the boat. I\\u2019m happy to see it\\u2019s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: \\u201cYou know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI do, but it\\u2019s not mine. Whose boat is it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn\\u2019t here and this other person who I don\\u2019t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it\\u2019s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I\\u2019m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I\\u2019m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it\\u2019s okay. He says, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It\\u2019s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I\\u2019ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I\\u2019m checking out the rigging.There\\u2019s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They\\u2019re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it\\u2019s a weird place to have this because normally they\\u2019re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can\\u2019t see what the operate. I\\u2019m trying to figure this out. The ship\\u2019s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I\\u2019m looking at it I\\u2019m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I\\u2019m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they\\u2019re not even ships at all, but they\\u2019re bobbing up and down so they\\u2019re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I\\u2019m off the boat of the woman who I didn\\u2019t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that\\u2019s okay because I didn\\u2019t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don\\u2019t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he\\u2019s not there. So I text him and ask him if he\\u2019s going to be sailing today. He says, \\u201cYes. Just wait there and I\\u2019ll be down at my boat in a moment.\\u201d My daughter and I wait. We\\u2019re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We\\u2019re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, \\u201cOkay, are you guys ready to go?\\u201d We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it\\u2019s right up against the dock and as we look in, it\\u2019s so deep that it\\u2019s black - you can\\u2019t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it\\u2019s so long I can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s enormous. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"At one point I was in a restaurant. My daughter was with me and she was a little girl again. There was nowhere to sit, so we cleared the table and brought the dishes into the kitchen. While we were in there, someone else took the table and moved the stuff I left there and put it on the floor. I was upset. There\\u2019s another snippet where I\\u2019m in a sailboat in the middle of a lake. We deliberately sail out into the middle of the lake. We put the sails away and then use the main halyard to pull people up. You can swing out onto the lake and let go and plunge in. When my daughter was on it, she wouldn\\u2019t let go so she kept swinging around and around and around.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Radio Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really interesting old house here. It\\u2019s semi-dark, too - it\\u2019s like the air has that kind of presence to it where the molecules have some kind of sentience. You can feel the energy in the air. It feels compassionate. So it\\u2019s also not very light. The windows, although they\\u2019re big, don\\u2019t seem to transmit an awful lot of light, so that casts a little bit of a shadowy effect over everything in the house. I\\u2019m aware that there is a floor above me, but I don't go into it in my dream. The ceilings are really high. The windows are deep and wide. It feels like mid-eighteenth century architecture of someone who would have had enough money to build a fair-sized house. I guess you would call the parlor, because it\\u2019s off the kitchen, has a big archway that goes into the sitting room. I can see the sitting room and kitchen from the parlor, but I stay in the parlor which has a big couch with deep cushions in it and a turkish rug that\\u2019s woven and quite colorful in muted tones. There\\u2019s electronic equipment against one of the walls. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m supposed to be recording some kind of radio show. In order to add my segment, I have to walk over to the electronic equipment - it\\u2019s got dials on it - and I\\u2019m moving the dials around watching the needle on the screen move up and down as I turn the dial. I\\u2019m trying to get it centered in the screen so I have a signal. Once I get the needle centered, I can hear the radio show that\\u2019s in progress. When I hear a certain tone, I\\u2019m supposed to start talking. I have brought with me what looks like an iPod, but it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s some kind of device that adds music that will be a bridge. I have to fade in the music, let it play for a few seconds, then fade the music out, then I\\u2019m to say what I\\u2019m supposed to say. My segment is 30 minutes. So I do this. I am waiting for the tone and I hear the tone. Somebody else\\u2019s music enters the feed. I can hear it, but when I try to center the dials to add my section, that music won\\u2019t go away. I think, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just sit here and wait the half hour that my segment is supposed to be and if the music keeps playing, then I\\u2019ll just leave after the half hour is over. I\\u2019m waiting. Twenty-three minutes pass and I know there\\u2019s only seven minutes left. I think it\\u2019s almost going to be time for me to go when someone else comes in the room. She says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re not adding your part.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s this strange music that isn\\u2019t responding to any of the dials.\\u201d So she goes over and starts moving the dials around. She\\u2019s trying to fix it. Her girlfriend comes into the room and sits down on the floor and waits. She spends the next seven minutes fiddling with it. Then the time is up. I just tell them I\\u2019m going to go. They ask, \\u201cCan you come back and try again tomorrow at the same time?\\u201d I consider this for a minute wondering if i want to keep just coming back here and waiting for nothing to happen. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try and come back one more time tomorrow.\\u201d Then, I\\u2019ve got this pack that goes across one shoulder, across my body and sits on my hip. I reach into it and grab two round discs about the size of a Canadian toonie. But they\\u2019re not toonies. They\\u2019re bumpy, thin and made of a condensed grain of some sort. I\\u2019m thinking that if you put them in water, they\\u2019ll swell up. I hand one of them to her. I close up the flat. As I turn around I notice one of my students is there. He walks with me as I go out the door. I walk down the porch and all of a sudden, it\\u2019s a lot lighter outside, but the sun isn\\u2019t shining; it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s less darkness. Het disappears - I guess he walks somewhere else. There\\u2019s a group of people, vendors, that have lined up these tall skinny tables that are like tubs along the sidewalk. I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s in them - they\\u2019re a little taller than my head, so I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s inside. They\\u2019re probably 1 foot by 2 foot in diameter and maybe another 1 foot deep. At the end of one, there\\u2019s a stepladder and I can climb up to see what\\u2019s in there. As I climb up, I see a whole bunch more of these little discs. I realize that they\\u2019re not made of grain, but of almonds. A woman who appears to be in charge approaches. She says \\u201cAa-mond\\u201d instead of almond. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cIs that the proper way to say this?\\u201d She repeats it twice like a callout: \\u201cAa-mond Aa-mond, Aa-mond Aamond.\\u201d So she\\u2019s selling them. She asks me if I\\u2019m interested in one of the Aa-monds Aa-monds. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you.\\u201d She says, \\u201cCome and sit down with me. I want to talk with you.\\u201d There\\u2019s something that looks like a two-person porch swing where the people are facing each other and your feet sit on the bottom and it moves on its own rocker. She sits in it and indicates that she wants me to sit across from her. So I do. She leans in. She has a smirk on her face as though she thinks it\\u2019s funny and says, \\u201cWhat do you think of Aa-mond Aa-mond?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe catchy way you\\u2019re pronouncing it? Or the product itself?\\u201d She says, No, what do you think of the way I\\u2019m calling it out?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s catchy. Caught my eye. I don\\u2019t understand what it is, but it was catchy enough that I turned my head to listen to you.\\u201d She kind of laughs. Right at that point, the dream ends, but in front of my face, I see this dangling pendant. It\\u2019s the size of my face and is all silver. It looks like it\\u2019s made out of molded Mercury. It\\u2019s a cat - a wild cat. It\\u2019s strangely futuristic amid this old-style market. It\\u2019s sleek, like a jaguar. It\\u2019s dangling on something. So it just appears and hangs down in front of my face. It\\u2019s probably 8-10 inches long and maybe about 4 inches wide. The mouth is slightly open and the lips are sort of curled back and it has fangs. It really looks like a jaguar head, except its ears are flattened, so there\\u2019s a sleakness about it that really doesn\\u2019t belong in the historical feel of the house, street market or the Aa-mond Aamond that people are selling.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Mural\\u201d It\\u2019s strange that I\\u2019m in the bedroom I had when I was a kid, but the furniture is gone. There are several people here with me, including my daughter and somebody I used to work with - I can\\u2019t remember which restaurant and I\\u2019m not even sure of his name. I think there is the man who did my daughter\\u2019s tattoo. I feel like my stepmother is in there, as well. The point of everybody being there is to draw a mural. It\\u2019s not clear what the subject of the mural is supposed to look like. One person starts off drawing in black with paint and a paintbrush what looks to be a fish. But then somebody comments, \\u201cNo that\\u2019s not right. That\\u2019s not what it looks like,\\u201d and then adjusts it - makes the torso/belly area a little thinner and makes it even thinner as it goes back towards the tail. Then someone else says, \\u201cMmm, that\\u2019s closer, but it still doesn\\u2019t look right.\\u201d Then someone else takes the paintbrush and begins to draw legs on it. Now it\\u2019s starting to look more like an insect with somewhat of a fish face. There\\u2019s a consensus that yes, that\\u2019s much closer to what it resembled. Then my daughter gets in there and removes part of it and adds what I think is much more accurate in terms of the legs and ribcage. Then I fall asleep for a little while, maybe just five minutes. I don\\u2019t think anyone noticed I was sleeping. When I woke up, it\\u2019s stunning. I\\u2019m thinking that it\\u2019s exactly what it looks like and it\\u2019s even got more details. I see the tattoo artist with the paintbrush in his hand and think yes, he would have been the one to put the detail on it. Then the other guy leaves the room and I do, too. We go down the hall and into the kitchen. He stays in the kitchen and I go out front of the kitchen. Now it looks like the kitchen has a passthrough window and the seating area is a big wide square auditorium. There are long rectangular tables set up that hold food, like a wedding buffet. The tables are covered with a white cloth. There are also round tables covered with white cloths and they have multiple chairs at them. There\\u2019s a stage like a school auditorium, but there\\u2019s no one on it and people aren\\u2019t facing the stage, either. The food is all set out on this one L-shaped table. I look at it and think that the food looks disgusting. It looks sloppy. Every single one has dried ramen noodles on the top as some kind of garnish. The items in the bowls are covered with breading. Each one looks slightly the same, only a little different. There are also cheese balls rolled in cracker crumbs and deep fried. I just think, \\u201cUgh, there\\u2019s nothing fresh anywhere.\\u201d My son is sitting at the table and I know he needs to eat. So I take two plates - one for him and one for me - and I head for the platter of plain roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. I think we can eat that. Just as I get there, a man who looks like the man who bought my sailboat. In my dream he has three little kids. He takes the big serving fork and squishes all the chicken up with the mashed potatoes and gravy and it\\u2019s making some kind of thick soup. I\\u2019m aghast because there were dried wheat noodles on the top and now they\\u2019re all mixed in. I say to him, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that on a buffet! Now nobody else can eat that.\\u201d He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWell, my kids like it that way.\\u201d I tell him that now there\\u2019s nothing for us to eat. I\\u2019m angry. I can feel the anger in my body - I can feel my heart racing and my body tightening up. So I try to sift through it with my spoon to determine if there are any pieces of potato or chicken that the gravy and wheat didn\\u2019t stick to. But after putting two tiny spoonfuls on my plate, I know it\\u2019s hopeless and I just set the plates down. My son goes back to the table and he\\u2019s just sitting there. I approach the kitchen and am thinking, \\u201cI wonder if that Rob guy has anything back there that he could give us that is not quite ready to be served on the table and hasn\\u2019t been coated with all that yucky stuff yet.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and notice that at the base of the passthrough window has holes with stagnant water in them. The water is black with algae. I can smell the mildew earth smell rising up from it. I wonder if the water was removed from it, if it would dry up and be more healthy. There\\u2019s a plastic pump with a long hose and a hand pump at the other end. It\\u2019s like the pump you\\u2019d use to pump out the bilge in a sailboat. So I stick the end in the water and I start pumping. The water does go out of the hole, but as soon as it goes out, it fills up again. I repeat this process about three times. It keeps filling up, but it only fills up a little bit, just enough to cover the black earth that is the component part of the hole. So I set the pump down and I stop. I\\u2019m hesitant to ask for food from the kitchen. I go back to the table and tell my son, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go.\\u201d We walk down a different hallway than we entered the room from. There are multiple bedrooms like there would be in a hotel for people to sleep in.\"],[\"\\u201cThe New Baby\\u201d I\\u2019m walking through a very busy urban area with a friend. It\\u2019s a downtown, heavily trafficked, very densely populated city. I know this because of the number of people around, the lack of space on the sidewalk, the streetcars and regular cars on the street that are passing by on the roadway, and the height of the buildings surrounding the street. I\\u2019m involved in a conversation with my friend. We\\u2019ve been walking for some blocks. We approach someone else riding a different looking kind of bicycle. It has two wheels at the back and one wheel at the front, so it\\u2019s a tricycle but it\\u2019s made for adults and you sit really low on the seat. My friend sees the person riding the bicycle and greets them. The cyclist slows down. My friend approaches the bicyclist and I realize they know each other. They have a conversation that I can\\u2019t hear. My friend\\u2019s back is to me and I can\\u2019t see who the cyclist is. It carries the energy of privacy anyway, so I don\\u2019t even try to approach. My friend walks back towards me and the cyclist continues for a few minutes ahead of us, and then she slows down again. Again, my friend approaches the cyclist and they have a private conversation. My friend comes back to me and says, \\u201cMy friend doesn\\u2019t talk to that many people. So don\\u2019t take it personally. It\\u2019s just how she is.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine.\\u201d We are walking while she says this. Then the cyclist slows down enough that she\\u2019s kind of keeping pace with us. She\\u2019s cycling beside my friend who is in the middle between us. My friend hangs back a little bit. It\\u2019s just the cyclist and I. Then I see her face. I realize the cyclist is female. She\\u2019s very withdrawn - i can sense this - so I don\\u2019t try to talk with her. My friend rejoins us - the one who was walking on foot - and says, \\u201cMy friend would like to talk to you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh okay.\\u201d I don\\u2019t recall that she ever said anything to me. I just feel that I\\u2019ve been invited into her inner circle. We all arrive at a place where the bicycle is parked. It looks like a storefront, but I can't see what\\u2019s inside because the windows are blackened. We all walk in. There is a very large bed that takes up most of the room once we get in there. There is a little girl playing on it. Beside that, in the two foot space between the bed and wall, there is another child playing. They seem to be very close in age. I\\u2019m gauging them to be no more than one year apart and I\\u2019m thinking about this. Then I realize that my friend\\u2019s friend, the cyclist, is pregnant. The little girl that was on the bed approaches me and she\\u2019s bouncing up and down on the bed and she\\u2019s so full of joy, innocence and exuberance. She invites me to jump on the bed with her. I don\\u2019t actually do that, but I take her by the hands and my upper body is jumping up and down - I\\u2019m not on the bed, my feet are on the ground. The child that was playing on the floor tries to join us but she can't get up on the bed, so I pick her up. I\\u2019ve been interacting with the children for a few minutes when the cyclist makes some kind of comment, but I never hear her voice. I feel like she\\u2019s commented about the fact that I\\u2019m getting along with the children. Then, everyone starts playing a game - it\\u2019s a find the things that are these colors kind of game. There\\u2019s a find something that\\u2019s green game and the kids scamper off. They don\\u2019t go very far because the room is very small and crowded with all kinds of stuff and a lot of different hair ornaments. I realize that the one child that was playing on the floor has a side ponytail made of short hair that sticks out of the side of her head like a shaving brush and the other one on the bed has a complex series of colored barrettes in her hair that keeps it off her face. So there\\u2019s a lot of different hair accessories. Then it\\u2019s a find something that\\u2019s purple game. I wait til the kids find their purple things, then I take a thick scrunchie with a purple ponytail attached to it and I select that and something else with tiny purple flowers on it. Then the cyclist woman says something but not out loud. I just realize that as I\\u2019m holding this scrunchie with a purple ponytail attached to it that it\\u2019s hers and she has some other different dyed hair colors in her own hair - she\\u2019s dyed it various colors and it\\u2019s quite creative. At this point I realize that this cyclist who is pregnant and my friend are partners. They have kept this on the downlow and not told anyone. This is their family. They\\u2019re looking for someone who will help out after the next baby is born. My friend asks if I would like to do this. I say, \\u201cYes, I would love to.\\u201d This is their way of slowly introducing me into their family without actually telling me that they were looking for someone. At this point, the doorbell rings or someone is knocking on the door. Now there is a hallway in the house and I go down the hallway to answer the door. There are some people outside with furniture. They have to bring it into the house, but it\\u2019s too big and doesn\\u2019t fit. I walk outside and look at it and see if there is any way of taking it apart. There is, but it\\u2019s really complicated. You have to take pieces of the base off. Now they look like tiles and I\\u2019m knocking them out with a hammer. There\\u2019s a man who is helping. I say to him, \\u201cWell this is good. But how do we get the tiles back in once we move it in the house?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh here look.\\u201d I see that there\\u2019s a tiny plastic line that encircles the whole base of this structure. If you hang the tile from it, wait a couple seconds, then give it a tap with a hammer, it replaces it. I try a few on my own with him there and it works, so this is good. The people that brought the furniture are now bringing it into the house, disassembled. I\\u2019m starting to pick up the pieces of tile and carry them back into the kitchen. The little girls are still jumping up and down and skipping around. They\\u2019re just happy. I go into the kitchen to start to prepare a meal. A man comes up behind me and goes underneath my skirt and stands up so I\\u2019m on his shoulders. I feel very light. I\\u2019m still preparing the food with my hands. It\\u2019s an interesting experience of being taller and lighter. I feel childlike. I\\u2019m enjoying this.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Operation\\u201d In this dream I\\u2019m at my sister and brother-in-law\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m sitting on a stool in their kitchen with my elbows on the kitchen island. My nephew who is training to be in Medical school - in fact he\\u2019s almost finished - has got a colander out of the cupboard and put three or four potatoes in it. He leaves it on the island and then leaves the kitchen. I think to myself: \\u201cHmm, I guess I\\u2019m supposed to be making the mashed potatoes.\\u201d Instead of cooking them and mashing them with a potato masher, I poke them repeatedly with some sort of instrument that I have in my hand - it\\u2019s some kind of kitchen tool. I do this until they are little tiny pieces of potato in the colander. Two other members of my family (it\\u2019s fuzzy who they are) come in. They are criticizing the way I\\u2019ve done this and saying it won\\u2019t work. My nephew returns to the kitchen and says, \\u201cOh yes, this will work. This is how I learned to do it at school. I\\u2019ve done this before. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Because he said that, the people who were criticizing me stop criticizing. Then the potatoes are cooked and they\\u2019ve turned out just fine.\"],[\"\\u201cLists and Packing\\u201d This was a bunch of different scenarios where I\\u2019m supposed to be leaving and going away. I\\u2019m trying to pack and things keep happening. Then I'm not where I\\u2019m supposed to be. At one point I\\u2019m on a giant bus instead of a boat\\u2026 In one scenario, I\\u2019m down by a river and I\\u2019m watching some cargo be loaded into various boats. It\\u2019s actually really pretty. I\\u2019m standing in a forested area and the river isn\\u2019t very big. A woman gets on a smaller boat with two children. She stores the gear. It seems like somebody else is in front, but I don\\u2019t see him. She makes reference to him. People are saying: \\u201cAre you sure you should be going that way?\\u201d She\\u2019s a little bit rebellious and says something like: \\u201cI\\u2019m not a novice.\\u201d Then I can see that she has some kind of equipment on the stern. She folds it out. It\\u2019s actually quite fascinating because it folds up so neatly that you don\\u2019t really notice it on the stern. It\\u2019s got spring loaded parts to it. She folds it out and it snaps in place. Then there\\u2019s another fold in it and she folds that out and it snaps in place. She stands on the one in the back. Then her two kids run out and she places them on the one in the middle. It\\u2019s like ropes that go across and they\\u2019re hanging onto it with their feet braced on one part and their hands clinging to the other. She stands on the one in the back and the man she\\u2019s with - her partner or whatever - is still in the front. She says, \\u201cThis is how I navigate the rapids.\\u201d Then I stand there and watch as the boat (it\\u2019s not driven, there\\u2019s no engine) is taken by the current. It seems to go a bit faster and everybody knows that there are rapids up ahead but we don\\u2019t see her go through them. In another scenario I\\u2019m loading things from a facility that also has things you can purchase. Apparently I\\u2019ve stored the gear I have to load in this facility. I have to load the things onto a giant motorhome. In order to take my stuff into the motorhome, I have to go up six little tiny creaky stairs and open up a trapdoor - it\\u2019s a small opening and it\\u2019s taking me a long time to do this. I noticed two giant spiders just prior to the trapdoor. One spider is flexing its legs and has a body that is two inches big and round and fat. It\\u2019s also flexing its wings like a dragonfly, only sharper and more angular. I think it\\u2019s interesting and I\\u2019ve never seen a spider like that. Then just beside it is this big fat web like a caterpillars tent. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m not taking my gear through there.\\u201d So I go through a door and exit out the front of the building. So it\\u2019s taking me longer to do this. When I finish, everyone else has their gear in the motorhome and have selected their beds. I\\u2019m counting people and counting beds and thinking we should have more beds than this, there are four of us going. Someone says, \\u201cWell, I want to keep some of the beds folded up so we have somewhere to sit and we can look at maps and stuff.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a good idea.\\u201d Then I look around again and asking: \\u201cWho are all these made beds for? There isn\\u2019t one for me.\\u201d I find out that the people who are in couples have taken one bed each instead of a double bed. I mention this and say, \\u201cOne of these beds needs to be for me because I\\u2019m going on this trip and you guys have made up all the beds.\\u201d Then Caroln, my ex-best friend says, \\u201cWell you\\u2019re sleeping with me.\\u201d I don\\u2019t really want to do that. Suddenly her parents are there and they\\u2019re in another bed. I say, \\u201cWhich bed is yours?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to correlate people with beds to see who belongs with all of these. Her parents are in a double bed, so that should be fine. Then there are three other beds made up, but no other people. Then I decide to sleep in a single bed in the back. Lisa tells me I can\\u2019t sleep there because of the sidewalk, whatever that means. Then there\\u2019s this other person who was supposed to be on the trip and she has one of the beds and is using another bed for her gear. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cFloor Creatures\\u201d I\\u2019m walking down the hallway towards the office at Central Senior School. I look down at the old wooden floorboards and see thousands and thousands, millions of little tiny orange flat beings on the floor. They\\u2019re getting squished and the floor is slimy. I try to walk on my tiptoes and avoid them. I notice that if I stand still they go around me. Their movement is synchronistic like a school of fish and they are all heading the opposite direction I am. I have to get to the office, though. Even though I move really slowly, I still squish a few under my toes. I\\u2019m almost at the office when I notice that a little girl has been knocked down by the flow of traffic of other students moving. She looks like she\\u2019s only in kindergarten. I go over and pick her up. I hold her up out of the flow of traffic. Now I\\u2019m at the office and I\\u2019m standing there waiting for someone to come help. While I\\u2019m waiting with her, i notice that the floor creatures are also in the office, but because no one is stepping on them, they\\u2019re starting to get bigger. Then they get bigger and bigger and they\\u2019re almost about my hip height when they start gnashing their teeth. I\\u2019m starting to feel scared. There are a whole bunch of them and they flow out of the office and move around us as though we\\u2019re a stick in the middle of a riverbed and they just flow around us. I turn my back to them as they head this way and they don\\u2019t touch us as they go into the hallway.\"],[\"\\u201cDownward Dog on a Shelf\\u201d I\\u2019m in a basement or a living room that has no windows. There are a lot of people. I see my brother and my stepmother. There\\u2019s something I have to do. I climb up onto a shelf that\\u2019s about eighteen inches wide and maybe four feet long. It\\u2019s tricky to get up there. There are other items on the shelf like it\\u2019s decorated for Christmas. There are pine bows and some Christmas cards. The arrangement goes up the wall and there are a lot of different cards that people have sent to my stepmother. While I\\u2019m up there, I crawl onto my hands and knees, then I lift my knees up and I\\u2019m in a downward dog. I realize I can\\u2019t back down and I\\u2019m stuck up there. I\\u2019m there for a really long time. My legs and arms start to shake. I say, \\u201cI need a little help here, please.\\u201d It\\u2019s still a few minutes before my stepmother comes over to help. She says, \\u201cOkay, what can I do to get you down?\\u201d I ask her if she can move the items off the shelf. She carefully takes them down. There\\u2019s a glass dome - the kind that would go over a lamp - and all these other things I\\u2019m afraid of breaking. She takes them down one by one, thenI can get back down onto my knees, move my hands towards them, then back to the end of the shelf where I can dangle my legs over the edge, hang on with my hands, and kind of jump down the rest of the way. When I get down, I realize that the ornamentation has gone all the way down through the wall. She\\u2019s trying to give people some things to take home, so she has more things to put up there. I\\u2019m being asked if I can take some of the things home, but I don\\u2019t really want them. But I agree anyway. Then, people say it\\u2019s time to sit at the table. Everybody, there\\u2019s about eighteen to twenty people, come to the table that is also so decorated I can hardly move. There is a full place setting with two forks, a knife, a spoon, side plates and multiple glasses. There are all these decorations around them, too. I\\u2019m supposed to be presenting a ring to her in commemoration of some kind of anniversary. I find this out just right now and I\\u2019m being told to sit at the head of the table instead of the side. I\\u2019m sitting there and while we\\u2019re waiting for a few other people to get to the table, somebody reads a poem. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019m going to be required to present something via poetry, also.\\u201d I don\\u2019t have a poem ready and didn\\u2019t even know I was supposed to do this. I leave the table and go back into the living room and am looking at bookshelves. They are filed alphabetically. I think, \\u201cWell, her name starts with M, so If I look under M, maybe I\\u2019ll find something.\\u201d So I pull out this tiny book of Psalms. I look under M and it skips it - it goes from N to P, so I can't find M and O. I put that book back on the shelf and pull out another book that looks like it might be Psalms and poems. I pull it off and it says it\\u2019s M on the outside, but everytime I look at it, there are no M\\u2019s. I close the book and look at the spine and it does say M, so I\\u2019m looking through it again and feeling like I\\u2019m running out of time and people are going to be sitting down and I don\\u2019t have anything prepared! So now I\\u2019m just taking a random book and reading through the poetry. I think it doesn\\u2019t suit her, so I put it back. I think maybe I just didn\\u2019t read it properly because I was in such a rush and maybe it would have suited her. I pull another book off the shelf and do the same thing. Then I see that everyone is at the table, including her. Now I just have to wing it. I put the book back and go back to the table. I don\\u2019t know what to say. I\\u2019m feeling really stressed. When I sit down, there is all this sticky stuff on my forearms from the table. I start to brush it off. My brother says, \\u201cOh, I took a long time putting that there and I liked it that way.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh sorry, I didn\\u2019t realize that was part of the decor. I thought it was just crumbs.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m trying to put it back and smear it around so it looks like it did before I was there. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cFootball Team\\u201d I'm walking through a pine forest. It\\u2019s fairly dense. I\\u2019m moving my arms up over my head in places so I can get my body through. It starts to get a little more sparse, then comes out into a clearing. There\\u2019s snow everywhere. I see up ahead of me a frost fencing and something that looks like it could be a building, although it\\u2019s mostly masked in snow. I walk through the snow towards the frost fencing. A man is standing there and he\\u2019s giving directions of some sort. He indicates that I am supposed to go straight ahead. As I\\u2019m walking through, other people start to gather. It\\u2019s getting a little more crowded. Then I remember I\\u2019m standing in a circle with people. I have something in my hand but i can\\u2019t see what it is. Other people are standing around and I know one of them - Blake. He gives me a bear hug and says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really good to see you.\\u201d As he lifts me up, my feet are off the ground. I can feel my body stretching - it feels like a full body stretch. When he sets me down, I wish he would do it again because the stretching felt really good. We\\u2019re being told to continue on our way towards the building. I notice the guys are wearing football uniforms - jerseys and pants. I wonder if I\\u2019m there for a game.\"],[\"\\u201cOpen Air Concert\\u201d I\\u2019m standing in a crowd in a large fairground area. There is hard packed earth and grass underneath my feet. It\\u2019s dark - it\\u2019s night time. The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn\\u2019t say anything but I know it\\u2019s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There\\u2019s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he\\u2019s somewhat hard although I don\\u2019t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There\\u2019s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren\\u2019t sitting down though, they\\u2019re just standing up. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don\\u2019t want to sit with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I\\u2019m looking for Trent because he\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen and know. I don\\u2019t find him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Shopping Mall\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large urban city. It\\u2019s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can\\u2019t identify where I am because of it. I\\u2019m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I\\u2019ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It\\u2019s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I\\u2019m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says \\u201cyou are here\\u201d and lists the index of all the stores, but I don\\u2019t see one. Because I\\u2019m still looking, I\\u2019m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren\\u2019t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they\\u2019re offering. They\\u2019re all specialty shops. Each store that\\u2019s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they\\u2019re not made of raincoat material or anything; they\\u2019re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they\\u2019ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there\\u2019s very little inventory offered in each. I think, \\u201cWow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.\\u201d Then I figure that whatever it is that they\\u2019re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what\\u2019s in the windows and note in a general way, \\u201cOh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I\\u2019m not even going to look at it.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cAdventures\\u201d I take a taxi to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I arrive and he\\u2019s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I\\u2019m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I\\u2019m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He\\u2019s also wearing something similar. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t really look like pajamas, so it\\u2019s okay to go out in them.\\u201d So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He\\u2019s in the front seat, passenger side. I\\u2019m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I\\u2019ve ever been to the town stadium. I\\u2019m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, \\u201cDo you mean the Place or the Colosseum?\\u201d At the same time as he\\u2019s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He\\u2019s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I\\u2019m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we\\u2019re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It\\u2019s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it\\u2019s glassed in and there\\u2019s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it\\u2019s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there\\u2019s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I\\u2019ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He\\u2019s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I\\u2019m trying to think where I\\u2019ve seen him. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He\\u2019s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they\\u2019re hundreds of years old. They look like they\\u2019re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it\\u2019s old because the lawns aren\\u2019t maincured, but set because they\\u2019ve been cared for so long they don\\u2019t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it\\u2019s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800\\u2019s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you\\u2019re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It\\u2019s just a screen door and is not latched. I can\\u2019t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman\\u2019s voice say, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I answer back, \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It\\u2019s a kitchen. It\\u2019s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it\\u2019s made just for cooking. There\\u2019s a doorway and we go into the next room. There\\u2019s a proper sized eating table in it. There\\u2019s another oven on the wall and I don\\u2019t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it\\u2019s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn\\u2019t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you\\u2019re on the waterfront. We\\u2019re about to go down the steps when I say, \\u201cJust a minute. Let\\u2019s walk back through here again. I noticed something.\\u201d So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, \\u201cLook, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There\\u2019s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn\\u2019t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.\\u201d Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We\\u2019re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I\\u2019m walking. He doesn\\u2019t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It\\u2019s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I\\u2019m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He\\u2019s a little more scared than I. I\\u2019m surprised that he\\u2019s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it\\u2019s like a pig fetus. It\\u2019s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He\\u2019s getting a little scared. It\\u2019s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I\\u2019m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can\\u2019t see it if you\\u2019re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There\\u2019s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there\\u2019s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They\\u2019re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there\\u2019s this other kind of thing that I see. It\\u2019s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to swim in that water.\\u201d Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She\\u2019s clothed and under the water. It looks like she\\u2019s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, \\u201cOh no! We have to save her!\\u201d So, I slip into the water and grab her. She\\u2019s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady\\u2019s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There\\u2019s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she\\u2019s only been hanging onto the pole and she\\u2019s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she\\u2019s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She\\u2019s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, \\u201cLook, she\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I\\u2019m giving her small sips and supporting her head.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Hanson Family Home\\u201d I am at a picnic table outside near the side of a road. There are two picnic tables. Although we can\\u2019t see the cars driving by from this area, I know we\\u2019re right beside a highway. There\\u2019s a gravel shoulder at the edge of a big road on one side of us. There\\u2019s a rough grassy area that\\u2019s speckled with dirt and gravel; there\\u2019s not very much growing there, just a little bit of grass. These two picnic tables are angled in an L-shape. There's a really rough structure, like what you\\u2019d find at a really old gas station store, but there are no gas pumps. So I\\u2019m sitting there and we\\u2019ve got some kind of meal. We\\u2019re evaluating whether or not this thing you sit in can be seen or noticed. One looks like a bathtub and the sides are copper, but it\\u2019s copper coating over enamel and the copper is being used to disguise it; the edges are probably about fourteen inches. There\\u2019s another one where the edges do not come up so high and they are only about six inches tall, but there\\u2019s a lip around the outside. It\\u2019s also been copper coated. We\\u2019re sitting in them on top of the picnic table bench. The other people at the table (not in the tubs) are saying whether or not this is noticeable. We think the shorter one will be less noticable. As it turns out, when we get a good look at them and people are sitting in them, the one that goes up fourteen inches kind of hugs your rib cage and sits under your armpits and because of the copper color, blends in with what people are wearing. You can\\u2019t really notice anyone is sitting in it as they\\u2019re eating. Whereas the other one has that big lip that sticks out and it\\u2019s a vast color difference between the tub and the people\\u2019s bodies and the shape of it is unnatural. So, we\\u2019re reporting back that the shorter one is not a good disguise. Then the scene changes and we\\u2019re in the Hanson\\u2019s house, only there is hardly any furniture in it and in some rooms, there\\u2019s none. The parents are there. The mom especially is more visible than the dad but I know he\\u2019s there somewhere. We walk in the door and the mom is sitting on a ladder facing away from it. She\\u2019s reading something. We go through that room which is empty of furniture. We go into a sitting room with a couch along one wall and where the tv would have been, there is nothing. No one is sitting there. Then we walk into what would have been the dining room. Again, there\\u2019s nothing in it. We go into the kitchen, which is now just an island attached to the wall with cupboards overtop. We walk in between the island and the wall to where the kitchen sink and counter occupy the whole end of the wall. I\\u2019m with Carrie, the youngest member of the family. Her older sister was my best friend in high school and in real life she\\u2019s gone - she died of cancer - but in my dream she\\u2019s still there as a ghost. Carrie and I are trying to wash a mountain of dishes that their four brothers and friends created. It\\u2019s horrible! I pick up one bag off the floor; it\\u2019s a shopping bag that was full of egg salad and some of the egg salad spills out onto the floor. I\\u2019m trying to scoop it up back into the abg. There\\u2019s all this gooped on food and you can\\u2019t even wash the dishes until you sort out dirty dishes from garbage, so we\\u2019re doing that. As we\\u2019re doing that, we\\u2019re hearing a conversation coming from the room with the couch. We\\u2019re both listening and trying to figure out what the two guys are saying. One is one of her middle brothers. He sounds different though. The other is a stranger and we don\\u2019t know who he is. The stranger sounds like he\\u2019s trying to sell something to her brother. We just don\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s trying to sell and it doesn\\u2019t make any sense. Her brother is kind of interested but not responding entirely favorably to the sales pitch. Then there\\u2019s silence - they both fall silent. I said to her: \\u201cDon\\u2019t your parents live in a different house now? Did they keep this house you grew up in? Are just you kids living in it? Are you all splitting the mortgage or rent?\\u201d Then, we turn around and the stranger is coming in through what would have been the eating kitchen. He stands there and addresses us; he\\u2019s trying to give us the same pitch. I\\u2019m highly suspicious of him. He looks and sounds slimy like a salesman trying to sell something that isn\\u2019t authentic. He looks wormy - his body shape is kind of wormy; he\\u2019s really pale and slender and he\\u2019s got tight cropped mousy brown hair and a nondescript face. I automatically don\\u2019t like him. Carrie and I look at each other with a slitty eyed look, like, \\u201cRight this guy\\u2019s gotta go!\\u201d She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll handle this.\\u201d She turns around and says, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d I continue cleaning up the dishes and am making some headway now - I scrape the garbage into one bag and am washing. When I\\u2019m finished, I go into the room where they are. The guy that I thought was her brother was actually a student from my advanced yoga teacher training, only he\\u2019s gained 200 pounds. He\\u2019s wearing an old man\\u2019s housecoat that you put on over your head. You can sort of see the rolls of fat of his body through the mesh of the robe and it has the big cotton pockets on the front. He and Carrie have obviously had some kind of conversation and the stranger is gone. We go back through the room where her mom was sitting on the ladder, but her mom is gone. Now we\\u2019re climbing up the stairs to go to the upper floor with just three bedrooms. Two of the boys share one, the other two share another and Carrie and her sister share the third. But Ellie\\u2019s bed is empty and Carrie is in the room by herself. She answers the question I asked her earlier and says, \\u201cNo, we don\\u2019t have an extra house. This is still our family home.\\u201d I\\u2019m surprised and feel confused because in the pictures, there is furniture in the house and this one doesn\\u2019t look like either home. I look over at Ellie\\u2019s empty bed and it is still the way she left it the last time she slept there. It has the green plaid bedspread and some of the ways she would have creatively decorated their tiny room. There\\u2019s something of mine in the room, too, because I stayed overnight there. I decide to pack my things up and it\\u2019s time to go.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arrangement\\u201d The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor\\u2019s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It\\u2019s some kind of reception, but I\\u2019m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don\\u2019t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he\\u2019s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he\\u2019s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I\\u2019ve earned it. I see in my mind\\u2019s eyes the word, \\u201cPlacement\\u201d on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I\\u2019m talking to them and realize I\\u2019m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It\\u2019s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There\\u2019s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It\\u2019s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It\\u2019s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he\\u2019s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I\\u2019m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I\\u2019m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I\\u2019m moving from one group to another making sure they\\u2019re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I\\u2019m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I\\u2019m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I\\u2019m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It\\u2019s hard for me to do this. I\\u2019m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It\\u2019s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There\\u2019s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I\\u2019m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don\\u2019t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll just sit with you.\\u201d This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There\\u2019s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It\\u2019s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it\\u2019s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I\\u2019m just now understanding this. So I\\u2019m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven\\u2019t had any time to get to know each other. I don\\u2019t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They\\u2019re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what\\u2019s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don\\u2019t. But my arranged husband does. There\\u2019s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we\\u2019re all in my arranged husband\\u2019s car and driving up towards his house. It\\u2019s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I\\u2019m responsible for making food. I\\u2019ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They\\u2019re working on a collaborative project. I\\u2019m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, \\u201cWell, is there anything else I can eat? I\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHere.\\u201d I say here, \\u201cYou can make the toast.\\u201d I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I\\u2019m feeling more at home. I\\u2019m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I\\u2019m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There\\u2019s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I\\u2019ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon. She says, \\u201cNo, all we have is on the racks.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve chosen this chapter book I thought he would like and see it. I tell him that\\u2019s not the book I wanted to get him and describe the stories in the book that I wanted to give him. This builds a little bit more of a bridge between us.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Working Vacation\\u201d I\\u2019m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I\\u2019m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I\\u2019m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn\\u2019t look like that now. There\\u2019s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It\\u2019s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it\\u2019s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They\\u2019re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that\\u2019s really sturdy. I don\\u2019t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it\\u2019s that big. It\\u2019s on its side and they\\u2019re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don\\u2019t really know what they\\u2019re building but they\\u2019re quite busy with it. They\\u2019re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they\\u2019re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they\\u2019re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It\\u2019s a mixed group of boys and girls and it\\u2019s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn\\u2019t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I\\u2019m not really sure what I\\u2019m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it\\u2019s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they\\u2019re doing and it doesn't look like they\\u2019re really doing anything except running around, I\\u2019m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don\\u2019t enter. There\\u2019s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don\\u2019t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn\\u2019t matter in the dream, so I\\u2019ll use the pronoun \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that\\u2019s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they\\u2019ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they\\u2019re exactly the same length and width. I think that\\u2019s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they\\u2019re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they\\u2019re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you want the other shoe?\\u201d The child doesn\\u2019t respond to me. I\\u2019m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I\\u2019m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn\\u2019t. I just wait around and all I\\u2019m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I\\u2019m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I\\u2019m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it\\u2019s a little darker than it is outside. There\\u2019s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It\\u2019s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We\\u2019re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I\\u2019m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She\\u2019s around 8. I notice that she doesn\\u2019t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We\\u2019ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we\\u2019re in a meadow now. We\\u2019re still walking and the sun sets and we\\u2019re in twilight. I wonder if we\\u2019re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don\\u2019t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can\\u2019t sleep. I\\u2019m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they\\u2019re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter\\u2019s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter\\u2019s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what\\u2019s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I\\u2019m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I\\u2019m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that\\u2019s strange. I\\u2019m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, \\u201cI think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.\\u201d She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don\\u2019t have a bathing suit so I\\u2019m just wearing something that won\\u2019t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we\\u2019d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn\\u2019t very big. Then I\\u2019m not sure how we\\u2019re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they\\u2019re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Red Coat\\u201d I\\u2019m in the Central Hotel for a gathering. There are a lot of people. It\\u2019s packed. It feels dark and stuffy. I\\u2019m wearing a red jacket over a dress. Someone who works there takes my jacket and hangs it up for me. I go to sit down at a table. I\\u2019m supposed to meet people there. As I sit down, I realize that everyone is meeting there prior to moving next door for a wedding. I take my seat and am scanning the room for people I know. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I just sit in the seat. I\\u2019m waiting until we are going to be notified that we\\u2019re moving. Then it seems rather sudden that someone from the hotel circulates through the guests telling them it\\u2019s time to move. They\\u2019re saying things that cause us to be hasty and move quickly and not to linger. I get up and move with the flow of the crowd. We exit out the front door and immediately take a left and go into the door beside it, then up a long set of stairs and into a big room. The room we just left was crowded and stuffy but had kind of a homey atmosphere - the decor was of wood with wood posts that held the ceiling up and it had that well oiled hand hewn feel to it. This upstairs room is just one big rectangle that\\u2019s maybe hastily put together. No one sits and stays for a long time. It remains empty. There\\u2019s no warmth when you walk in. There's a long table. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m supposed to sit here. Again, I\\u2019m scanning the room for people I know. I see two people who used to live in my neighborhood and I thought were my friends. They know I\\u2019m there but keep to themselves and make no effort to come talk to me. I seem to know the people I\\u2019m sitting with but I can\\u2019t identify them in the dream. I realize we\\u2019re here for a reception. The servers bring food out. Everybody has the same plate of food. We eat without gusto. The servers take the food away and place dessert on the table. I pick at it. They sit down jugs of beer, but I don\\u2019t normally drink beer. I take a little bit in a cup and it tastes refreshing and very cold. I drink about half my cup. People are getting up out of their seats and moving into smaller groupings. There\\u2019s lively talk coming from these groupings. I feel isolated and unwelcome. I\\u2019m not sure what the reception is for. I get up and circulate a little. There\\u2019s a little dancing. I want to dance but there\\u2019s no one to dance with. I like the music and am feeling the dance in my body but there\\u2019s no one to share it with. I see someone who used to be a neighbor and go down to her. She says hello and talks with me for a few minutes. We sit down in chairs. I go to show her something on Facebook, but there\\u2019s no internet signal and my phone won\\u2019t load it. She gets bored and wanders away while I\\u2019m waiting. I just close my phone up and put it back in my purse. I go into the original room where I saw my old neighbors and they\\u2019re still involved in a conversation. They see me but don\\u2019t wave or beckon me over. I feel like I just want to go home now. Then I realize my red jacket is missing. I ask one of the staff if it\\u2019s possible to go downstairs and get it from the coat rack. They tell me that downstairs is now closed. It\\u2019s really cold out and I need my jacket. Now I'm unsure what to do. I stand by the doorway and another staff person comes up and says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve found three red jackets downstairs. Is one of these yours?\\u201d I think the first one is. It\\u2019s a felt jacket and it\\u2019s long. I put it on as though I recognize it. It\\u2019s comfortable and feels like it fits me. Then I see the other red jacket and think, \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s my grandfather\\u2019s coat.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m mistaken. The one I\\u2019m wearing is not mine. The noisy one is mine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell just keep the other one.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I can't do that, it\\u2019s not mine. It belongs to somebody.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, no one has claimed it. It\\u2019s been here for a long time.\\u201d I take it off and put on my grandfather\\u2019s coat. I\\u2019m holding it because he\\u2019s not giving me anywhere to put it. There are no hangers and he\\u2019s walking away. I feel uncomfortable that I have this coat that\\u2019s not mine. Then I go out the door because now they\\u2019re closing. I have this coat that doesn\\u2019t belong to me over my arm. I\\u2019m not sure how far to go with it, so I stand across the street because i can\\u2019t stay in the building.\"],[\"\\u201cFor a Little While\\u201d I\\u2019m in a village. It\\u2019s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don\\u2019t live in houses. It\\u2019s outside living. People\\u2019s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I\\u2019m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it\\u2019s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I\\u2019m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I\\u2019m waiting for her dad. I know he\\u2019s there but he\\u2019s invisible. He has a presence but I haven\\u2019t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we\\u2019re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I\\u2019m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It\\u2019s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there\\u2019s food you can eat with your fingers that\\u2019s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we\\u2019ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there\\u2019s privacy from everyone else\\u2019s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He\\u2019s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He\\u2019s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he\\u2019s still there in spirit but in the flesh he\\u2019s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we\\u2019re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She\\u2019s looking around. I think to myself, \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for the parents she doesn\\u2019t have.\\u201d I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I\\u2019m happy to look after her. She\\u2019s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter\\u2019s father. I miss that he can\\u2019t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.\"],[\"\\u201cGrief and Ash\\u201d I\\u2019m having a conversation with a woman that continues despite the fact that I need to use the washroom. It continues despite the fact that I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and pushing something out of my body. I\\u2019m pushing shit out of my body. I don't have to strain too hard. My body does evacuate it pretty effortlessly. I can hear other people in the house but it\\u2019s more like white noise rather than distinct conversation. Then the person I\\u2019m talking to continues talking about mundane topics as though I\\u2019m not sitting on the toilet and I\\u2019m not evacuating shit from my body. I can feel my body is finished. Then I take the toilet paper from the roll on the wall, nothing unusual. As I try and wipe the remnants of it from myself, it feels like there\\u2019s gritty stuff like seeds. I wipe again. Now instead of there being less on the paper, there\\u2019s more. I repeat this process about six times. There\\u2019s more each time. I feel like it\\u2019s spreading it around the cheeks of my bum. And so, I think that this process is spreading it around me more. I don\\u2019t want to continue it. I need to go somewhere else where I can get clean. I tell the woman, \\u201cI can\\u2019t talk to you right now. I need to stop this.\\u201d She does leave. I take off all my clothes and get into the shower. I scrub myself from head to toe. I realize that the shower, the water, the soap is making me clean. I stop, rinse myself off and get out. I towel myself off. I feel clean now. But I\\u2019m disgusted at my clothes. I think they carry something. I put them in the washing machine in the bathroom, add some soap, turn the water on and start them. Then the dream continues on. I just can\\u2019t pull any more out of it.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scavenger Hunt\\u201d I\\u2019m in this outdoor space. It\\u2019s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It\\u2019s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they\\u2019re conifers. I don\\u2019t recall any deciduous trees at all. I\\u2019m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there\\u2019s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that\\u2019s hidden for the purpose that it\\u2019s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can\\u2019t see the marks unless you\\u2019re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don\\u2019t have any equipment. We\\u2019re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there\\u2019s some item that\\u2019s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There\\u2019s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What\\u2019s the natural food you do with fish food if there\\u2019s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I\\u2019m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it\\u2019s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it. Then it submerges itself. Right after that, an even bigger fish starts swimming up to the surface. It\\u2019s about twelve feet long! We all start running out. It\\u2019s the mother. There was only one piece of food and we\\u2019re thinking that we might be the other food. Each one of these spots has hazards and the thing you\\u2019re supposed to solve. Some people are able to remember three red dots and they just keep moving back. Other people can only remember one at a time so they go back down to the bottom of the hill and look through the night vision glass again. One of these times when I go back down there Omar is there. We group together to do our scavenger hunt. We have to go quite far. It\\u2019s a lot farther out than some of the ones that are closeby. There is a long climb up a tree then you have to move from the tree onto a rock cliff face. We swing onto the rock. There\\u2019s a forest ranger lookout tower and we climb up it. He finds all this survival equipment - tiny packages of dehydrated food wrapped in plastic and shirts with long sleeves individually wrapped in plastic. They\\u2019re the kind of shirt that protects you from the sun. There are other things also wrapped in plastic. Because he got there first, he has this big box. Luckily I was there, too, because it\\u2019s really impossible to hold a box and climb back down to the night vision pane of glass. So he hands me the box, then climbs down, then I hand him the box and climb down. This is how we get down. Once we get down, he is tasked with needing to divide the contents of the box equally between all the participants of this scavenger hunt. While he\\u2019s doing this, I go and find more of the marks. When I come back, he\\u2019s finished the task. Apparently, it\\u2019s my job to disperse the packages he\\u2019s divided and give one to each person. For some reason, he\\u2019s written really, really tiny and the ink of the pen he was using is really blotchy and runs out sometimes. It\\u2019s really hard to read the names. I\\u2019m trying to guess some of them. I do. I have another pen and am writing on the top trying to fill in the blanks. It starts to get dark. There\\u2019s one more task to finish. I go up the hill to a grassy area. There\\u2019s a lawnmower. Those two things go together. What do you do with a lawnmower? You cut grass. Only it\\u2019s really tricky because the grass is growing on the side of a slope and it\\u2019s pretty much a vertical rise. That\\u2019s the only long grass. I\\u2019m trying to push the lawnmower up and then guide it back down so it doesn\\u2019t flip over and cut my feet with the blade. I do this. It\\u2019s dark. This man comes over and comments that I\\u2019ve done a good job. The other tricky part about doing this is that there are some plants - angel\\u2019s trumpet - growing on that slope. You wouldn\\u2019t cut that with your lawnmower. So I have to be careful to get the grass without damaging the angel's trumpet. I finish this and then leave the lawnmower. At this point, there\\u2019s some kind of alarm raised. Everybody is running. There is some chaos. I see someone I know. I run over to her and ask if she knows what\\u2019s going on. She\\u2019s not sure and says I should stay here. This is one of the flat spots, a plateau. Others are gathering here, too. I see Omar and realize I didn\\u2019t finish dispersing all the survival kits. I can feel the fear in people as we\\u2019re standing and waiting to see if we have eased the threat by finding the marks and solving the puzzles, doing what we need to do? This question is just hanging in there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Symphony\\u201d I\\u2019m at my friends Maggie and Joey\\u2019s house, only it\\u2019s not their house, it\\u2019s the old Farm House. Maggie and Joey live there. I\\u2019ve gone up to visit them. Maggie has all kinds of little interesting things for us to do. We\\u2019re making jelly at one point. Then we go into a different room and are doing a craft. We\\u2019re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he\\u2019s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That\\u2019s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on with him because he\\u2019s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, \\u201cCome and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he\\u2019s wearing a tux.\\u201d I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some \\u201cdoing of the hair.\\u201d I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She\\u2019s got several things that she\\u2019s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don\\u2019t think anything of this. I think she\\u2019s just seeing how this will look or how these two items will look if you put them together. Then she says to me, \\u201cI can\\u2019t go. I\\u2019m really sick. I don\\u2019t feel up to this. But it\\u2019s something Joey really wants to do.\\u201d I ask her, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re sick?\\u201d She tells me she\\u2019s been sick for a really long time and she thinks that her time is limited. I feel this grief moving up through my feet, through my legs and into my heart. It kind of suspends all my decision making qualities. I\\u2019m just standing there trying to take this all in. i look at her really closely, looking for traces of truth, not of her words, but that her body is actually that sick. I\\u2019m looking at her skin and the sclera of her eyes. I\\u2019m trying to see what I have not noticed before and wasn\\u2019t aware of. Then I tell her I don\\u2019t want to go to the symphony and she should do this because it\\u2019s something special and they\\u2019ve been planning it for a long time. Then suddenly her hair is drawn back into a formal style with a bun at the back of her head. She\\u2019s wearing earrings that dangle down from her ears. She\\u2019s dressed in a strapless gown. She looks beautiful. We go back down the stairs. This time she disappears into the kitchen. I\\u2019m in the living room and Joey is standing there. I say, \\u201cI hope you guys have a really good time. This will be wonderful. You two look fabulous.\\u201d He comes over and gives me a hug. His face is overtop my left shoulder. I can feel that he\\u2019s crying. He says, \\u201cI hope you're still here when we get back.\\u201d Now I just feel kind of numb. I feel heavy. I no longer know what to do while they\\u2019re gone and I don\\u2019t want to stay in the house but I do. I look outside down the long farmhouse style driveway. All the earth looks frozen. The trees are bare. There\\u2019s no growth left in the ground. It\\u2019s nighttime. Even in the activity that was in the house of jamming things in jars and making preserves is tucked away. The house feels empty. I think, \\u201cMaybe I should just have a bath and go to bed.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cOld School\\u201d I\\u2019m both in the place when it existed in its own time and again later as some kind of impermanent guest. In the dream, when it starts, I\\u2019m living there. Then it\\u2019s almost like the time I spent actually living there is a memory I\\u2019m unaware of as I re-enter it. The setting is a cleared area in a forest. The structures are really rustic; they\\u2019ve been hand-hewn and erected without machines. Everything has been done by hand. In fact, the floor inside one of the structures, the one I\\u2019m in, is made of gravel and wood chips and it\\u2019s quite chunky. I\\u2019m inside one of these structures in the village and looking out the window. I look at the other structures from the window and think, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s interesting. When they resurrected this, they put them in a different spot than they originally were.\\u201d I notice that the windows aren\\u2019t made of glass, but something a little opaque. I\\u2019m not quite sure what the material is. I\\u2019m inside one of these and it\\u2019s definitely the biggest of the structures and has two floors. I don\\u2019t go to the upper floor. I\\u2019m sitting on something and it\\u2019s not really a couch - it\\u2019s something stuffed with straw or horse hair. I\\u2019ve got a binder with me. I take it out and it\\u2019s study notes. I realize that I should have looked at these earlier because I actually have a lesson plan that\\u2019s due today. I'm not worried though. I think. \\u201cAh, that\\u2019s fine. I just have to sit here and sit still and do it.\\u201d So I start to read through the instructions and I hear some people talking in one of the other rooms. I stand up and walk over the rough floor and sure enough there are two other people. I\\u2019m wearing headphones at this point. One of the men is telling a story to the other man sitting there about how he got one of his jobs and a job he was quite happy with. He had been called in to fill in for someone else. He had some kind of project and no one had ever seen this kind of projector before. It put all of the work he needed to teach up on a whiteboard and it was really easy, it was compact, it was able to stream a whole bunch of different things into one machine. The way he told the story, people were marveling at it, asking him where he got it, etc. He had picked it up from somewhere exotic. They had called him in to do this kind of work in this school on a regular basis and they hadn\\u2019t hired anyone for years and years and years apparently, according to him. What he didn't realize is that my headphones were picking up the entire conversation he was having with his friend. His friend realized this and said, \\u201cI see we have someone else on the line.\\u201d He said, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s just Lynn.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re right, my headphones are picking it up, but I\\u2019m not Lynn.\\u201d Then I try to reach around to my ears and see if I can find some buttons that would turn off their conversation, although it had been interesting. I actually want quiet so I can do my own work. I leave the area where they had been making contact with each other. I realize as I was leaving that they weren\\u2019t even there and the whole thing was a hologram. I go back to my binder and sit on the stuffed cushion. I hear someone coming down the stairs from the upper floor. It\\u2019s a woman. I tell her that I\\u2019m going to do these lesson plans here. She just acknowledges that and drifts off. I don\\u2019t see her again. As I\\u2019m looking through the lesson plan, someone from my headphones asks me what I want to teach when I finish my program. I don\\u2019t know who it is - it\\u2019s like a disembodied voice. I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve worked with kids before and I really don\\u2019t think I want to put that much physical energy into my day, plus they get sick a lot. I really want to be in an environment where there\\u2019s not so much illness. Middle school, eh, that\\u2019s a lot of work, too, but in a different way. Maybe?\\u201d I realize that as I\\u2019m telling this, I want to teach high school because the environment is generally cleaner in terms of illness. You don\\u2019t need as much equipment because the kids don\\u2019t need to be entertained. I\\u2019m thinking that if I had the same technology that I overheard the man talking about in the other room, then the high school kids would be engaged and it\\u2019s really quite compact and doesn\\u2019t take up much space. I put this to voice and say, \\u201cYou know, I think I want to teach high school kids.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cRed Sand\\u201d I\\u2019m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I\\u2019m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it\\u2019s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it\\u2019s actually ending. She\\u2019s co-teaching with another person I\\u2019ve never seen. I think it\\u2019s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I\\u2019ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It\\u2019s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they\\u2019ve obviously already had their asana class and they\\u2019re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it\\u2019s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we\\u2019re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she\\u2019s white, if the whole class was like this or if it\\u2019s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it\\u2019s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I\\u2019m surprised to see her. She says, \\u201cNo, the whole class was like this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d So I ask her, \\u201cIs this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d There are six people. I think, \\u201cWow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.\\u201d Then I say to her, \\u201cI have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.\\u201d I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I\\u2019m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don\\u2019t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that\\u2019s leaving. As I\\u2019m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don\\u2019t even know what they are. But I\\u2019m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith\\u2019s flute looks like an obo, but it\\u2019s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it\\u2019s such beautiful music. You can tell they\\u2019ve played together for a really long time because they\\u2019re really tight together. They\\u2019re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there\\u2019s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I\\u2019ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, \\u201cGood, we\\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\\u201d The music has something to do with what they\\u2019ve been practicing in the class. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, \\u201cI hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.\\u201d We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we\\u2019re at the outskirts of town. He says, \\u201cLook what they\\u2019re going to put on this land.\\u201d He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he\\u2019s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he\\u2019s doing this, I\\u2019m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, \\u201cOh, I think there\\u2019s red clay under this.\\u201d I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, \\u201cLook. There\\u2019s red sand underneath here.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just spray painted. I say, \\u201cI don't think so, it looks real. It\\u2019s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.\\u201d He\\u2019s quiet and doesn\\u2019t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he\\u2019s adding onto it so it\\u2019s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.\"],[\"\\u201cQuest for a Job\\u201d I\\u2019m at the restaurant where I worked during university. I\\u2019m sitting at a booth across from the pizza oven with a friend. We\\u2019re not there for me to look for a job and I\\u2019m not working there. We\\u2019re just there because he\\u2019s hungry. He\\u2019s eating a salad. Overtop of the booth, I see one of the people I used to work with. He\\u2019s in uniform. I peak up over the booth. We make eye contact and say, \\u201cHey. Wow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long.\\u201d I ask him, \\u201cAre you working here again?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I say, \\u201cSo they\\u2019re hiring again?\\u201d There\\u2019s been some kind of hiring freeze. He says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I wonder if they\\u2019ll rehire me because I really need a job. I look to see who the manager is. I\\u2019m looking around the floor from my seat and see that it\\u2019s George. He had stopped working there just shortly before I did. So I\\u2019m also surprised. Eventually he comes back to the pizza oven. We make eye contact and I wave to him and say, \\u201cHey, when did you start working here again?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNot that long ago.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWould you take an application from me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cHere, I\\u2019m too busy to talk. Just follow me around for a little while.\\u201d So I do. We go back into the prep area and into the walk-in fridge. I\\u2019m trying to find out who the owner is and if it\\u2019s the same ones who bought it when we all left our jobs. He says, \\u201cIt is the same ones, but\\u2026\\u201d and he doesn\\u2019t finish the rest of the sentence. I see a couple of other people I have not seen since high school and one who never worked at the restaurant, but he\\u2019s sitting there dressed in prep clothes. So, I\\u2019m waiting for George to finish the sentence and he goes into the dish pit. I follow him. I grab a few dishes because it\\u2019s really busy and I\\u2019m starting to help out. We go back into the area where we pick up the food plates. We go over to the bar. While he\\u2019s doing something there I put some dirty glasses into the dishwasher. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019m not even dressed for this but I\\u2019m doing all this stuff. This feels wrong.\\u201d I walk up to the hostess stand and there's a line-up. I\\u2019m like, alright, this is a bad idea. I\\u2019m not dressed for this. I\\u2019m not even wearing proper shoes. This isn\\u2019t safe. I walk back towards the table where my friend is still sitting and waiting for me. I explain that they\\u2019re hiring, but I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to put an application in. I say, \\u201cMaybe we should just go home. I\\u2019ll drop you off and then I\\u2019ll pick up a resum\\u00e9 from my house and come back.\\u201d Except it\\u2019s really late and I\\u2019m afraid that by the time I do that, the restaurant will be closed. So now I\\u2019m trying to ask George when the next time he\\u2019ll be here so I can bring a resum\\u00e9 back. He says, \\u201cJust wait.\\u201d I say, \\u201cokay,\\u201d and I just sit there at the table and wait. Eventually things slow down and he comes back over and says, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019m not working again until Thursday.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cHmm, he only has two shifts a week.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t really want to wait that long if they\\u2019re hiring because everybody wants a job. I would like to put my application in sooner rather than later.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell there is another way of doing this. Follow me.\\u201d So we go out the side door through the closed patio and down towards the end of the mall. In reality there\\u2019s only one store between them and the end of the mall. But, in my dream, it turns into a dream I had previously where I was with the owner and somebody\\u2019s car was broken down (the dream is called the Diode) and we go down to the end of the mall. There\\u2019s this complex series of diodes store that we enter. I\\u2019m thinking in this dream, \\u201cWow, this is the same store that I had in my dream!\\u201d I start to tell this to George: \\u201cYou know what\\u2019s really weird? I had a dream that this store existed a few months ago even though it didn\\u2019t, and now it does!\\u201d He just looks at me and says, \\u201cHmm, it\\u2019s always been here.\\u201d We enter the doorway of the electronics store. It\\u2019s the same kind of squirrel\\u2019s nest of all kinds of tightly packed boxes of switches and diodes. We go upstairs. There are two big doors made of wood at the top of the stairs and a small vestibule in front of it. I realize I don\\u2019t have my mask. I turn around and say this to George, but as I reach into my pocket, I feel it - it\\u2019s in there. I pull it out and say, \\u201cNevermind, I do have it.\\u201d I continue going through the doors. Then I open one door and it\\u2019s a poolhall and I can smell cigarette smoke. I close the door quickly and turn around to George and say, \\u201cAre you sure? What are we doing here? It\\u2019s a poolhall and stinks of cigarettes.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo this is the right place. You can wait here if you want.\\u201d He goes in and goes all the way to the end of the room, gets something and comes out. He says, \\u201cOkay, here, this is it. You can fill this out instead of the application.\\u201d it\\u2019s folded in half lengthwise. But it\\u2019s this twenty-five page dossier that wants all kinds of information - banking records, genealogy of your family, and it\\u2019s crazy the amount of personal information they want. I look at him and say, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the only other way of applying.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t you just take my resum\\u00e9?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIf you can go home and get it before close time, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d So we walk back through the stripmall into the side of the building. I see another person who worked there when I did has already put in another application. I\\u2019m starting to feel anxious that I\\u2019m not going to make this window of opportunity. By the time I fill out this twenty-five page book, it\\u2019s all going to be gone. I thank him and leave. I drop my friend off and drive home. It\\u2019s pitch dark. I go upstairs, find a resum\\u00e9, put it in a plastic sleeve and turn around to go back. But it\\u2019s already the next day. When I arrive, the restaurant is busy. I\\u2019m dressed better this time. I\\u2019m wearing the black jeans and the proper black shoes, but not the apron and shirt. I see there\\u2019s another manager on duty who I don\\u2019t know. I try to catch her eye but she\\u2019s busy, so I sit down at the bar and wait patiently. Eventually she comes back. I hand her my resum\\u00e9 and ask if it\\u2019s okay. She says, \\u201cHmm, let me see it.\\u201d She looks at it and says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not quite the right person we were looking for.\\u201d I let her know I used to work here with all of the other people that have been recently rehired. She says, \\u201cThank you, but no anyway.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why but I start to feel really old, really depleted, really horrible. I wonder if I\\u2019m ever going to be able to get a job that\\u2019s enough to support my family.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Courtroom\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure when this dream starts if I\\u2019m just observing and then become one of the people or if I was one of the people all along. I\\u2019m in a courthouse. I can see it from the outside - the big wide stairs, the huge pillars, the giant doors, the big spacious hallways that are made of marble, the floor is really slippery and looks wet but it is not. This is the part where I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m just observing or if I\\u2019m one of the people. In the hallway there are just a couple of people. I\\u2019m walking through it trying to find some justice. I can feel this tight ball of outrage mixed with grief in the middle of my chest. I wonder which courtroom I\\u2019m supposed to be in. as I\\u2019m looking at each door, I\\u2019m looking for some sign that this will be where my case will be heard. There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there\\u2019s four, then eight, then sixteen; they\\u2019re multiplying exponentially. Then they\\u2019re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it\\u2019s all just men. Then there are so many that there\\u2019s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They\\u2019re only inches away from me and now there\\u2019s even more. I\\u2019m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, \\u201cThese aren't regular men. Look, this man\\u2019s gay.\\u201d As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there\\u2019s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They\\u2019re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there\\u2019s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that\\u2019s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they\\u2019re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that\\u2019s the end of it. But then they regain their footing and they start to make some space again as they\\u2019re running down the next hallway. Then I\\u2019m in the crowd, I\\u2019m not just watching. I\\u2019m looking for a place where we can blend in so the people who are chasing us won\\u2019t recognize us. Or is there a door that isn\\u2019t just a courtroom but actually leads to someplace we can hide. So this goes on. The hallways are endless. There\\u2019s nowhere to blend in because someone keeps recognizing us. Then at one point, there\\u2019s enough distance between us and the people chasing us. I open one of the doors. You can hardly see that it\\u2019s a door because it\\u2019s a white door within a white wall. I open it up and run in. it\\u2019s got a push-in button lock. I can feel somebody on the other side of the door. The door handle is in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to push the button, but the person is turning the door so that the button keeps popping out. It keeps happening over and over and over again. Then I think this is it and I\\u2019m done for. Then I hear this voice on the other side saying, \\u201cPlease let me in!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAlright it\\u2019s not someone trying to chase, but someone trying to hide.\\u201d I open the door up and this big round man comes in. I think we\\u2019re not going to fit in here because he\\u2019s so big. But we do. Now he's in front of me. I think to myself that if someone opens the door, they\\u2019re not even going to see me because he\\u2019s so big he\\u2019s filling up the space. Then I can feel that his body feels soft and doughy, it\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s absorbing me. I think, \\u201cWell, at least it\\u2019s not uncomfortable.\\u201d Then I hear the crowd and the noises of the feet pounding and the yelling. They\\u2019re getting closer and closer and closer. Then they\\u2019re right outside the door. I feel them going a little away and then they\\u2019re gone in the distance. Then it\\u2019s quiet. I start to let out my breath. My heart\\u2019s pounding so hard that I can\\u2019t breathe. It starts to subside a bit. I get an inhale again. After some minutes, I\\u2019m starting to breathe again. Both of us are scared to open the door. It\\u2019s pitch dark in here because there is no justice here. It\\u2019s quiet for long enough that the building sounds empty. I think the fight has just gone on outside. It didn\\u2019t disappear, it\\u2019s somewhere. We open the door, go into the dark hallways. There\\u2019s no one in the building. It sounds like no one is in here. We walk down the hallways until we see the door back to the street. The street is dark. This other person just disappears. I\\u2019m walking and wondering where to go. Then I see one shop that looks open. It looks like a curio shop. I open the door. It has one of those cowbells on the top and makes the cowbell noise. An elderly woman comes out. She tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m over here if you need me.\\u201d She disappears into the piles and piles of stuff. I go off into the room to the right. I don\\u2019t have any money. At first it just looks like junk, broken, dusty, dirty things. I don\\u2019t even really want to sort through them. Then as I look at things more closely I think it\\u2019s not just piles of junk, but actually antique furniture. You can see where she started to decorate the furniture to make it look like a store with lamps and tablecloths and little ornaments around those. But as no one was buying anything, she\\u2019s collecting and hoarding them. Eventually you couldn\\u2019t tell where the arrangement was and where it was just things upon things upon things. But I become interested in the layers because it\\u2019s the furniture I\\u2019m trying to decipher. In one corner of one room, I\\u2019ve sorted my way into it. I\\u2019m interested in this desk because it looks like there is a secret compartment in it somewhere. So I\\u2019m moving things around, taking all this stuff off it...broken picture frames and I wonder who these people are and setting them somewhere else. I\\u2019m moving the lamps. There are too many broken things that I can\\u2019t tell what\\u2019s what. But once I move a lot of the broken stuff, I can start to see actual things. I move the lamp. There\\u2019s a kitchen utensil and it\\u2019s old enough that I don\\u2019t recognize it. I\\u2019m wondering what it was used for. Then I\\u2019ve cleared enough of the space on top of the desk that I can open it. It\\u2019s one of those roll tops that rolls back into itself. Now there\\u2019s stuff inside and it\\u2019s just crammed with stuff! So I have to move all these other things. Suddenly there\\u2019s a man beside me. I recognize him as this guy who I talked to for a little while then realized he wasn\\u2019t a very nice person so I stopped talking to him. Every word he said was so insincere. He says to me, \\u201cLook, there are two little pieces of wood at the back of this. If you lift them up, it exposes a secret compartment.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, how did you know this? There was so much stuff in front of this.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been in here for a really, really long time.\\u201d Then he goes back to sitting on the floor. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s a prisoner there and he\\u2019s trapped somehow. I\\u2019m looking to see what was in this compartment. It\\u2019s cartons, like the kind of boxes that look like shoe boxes but are made of pretty material...or maybe it\\u2019s wallpaper over cardboard. But you see older ladies with them. They wrap things in material and tissue paper so dust moths don\\u2019t eat them. There are a whole bunch of these stacked in here. I wonder if this actually belongs to the old lady who has this store. I find her. I go into the other room and find her and say, \\u201cOne of the desks in the other room has a secret compartment.\\u201d She looks at me with some surprise and affection and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019ve found it!\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell let me know if you need any help, I\\u2019ll be over here.\\u201d I think she doesn\\u2019t mind that I\\u2019m looking through all this stuff and sorting it. I go back into the first room and am thinking that it\\u2019s okay to look through all these things! I\\u2019m sorting them into different piles. I leave the desk open the way I found it. I go across the room. The man is still there and he has his eyes closed like he\\u2019s trapped. It looks like he can\\u2019t move away from that spot. In this one corner of the room, I\\u2019m sorting through things and I find this beautiful string of lights. There are only five lights on it. It looks like hand-blown glass. The blue is a beautiful color. In fact, you can see the different elements in the blue that would have been exposed when the glassblower was blowing it to make the bulb. You can see bits of orange and terracotta and different shades of this deep carnival royal blue. I\\u2019m admiring them and thinking, \\u201cWow, here\\u2019s this beautiful thing hidden amidst all of this junk.\\u201d I set them carefully aside. Now I find a picture with a round oval frame. It looks like me when I was a little girl. I set that beside the string of blue lights. I wonder what else is in here that maybe once belonged to me when I was young. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cEscape\\u201d I\\u2019m in a grey cement building. It looks like the Hoover Dam - it\\u2019s that tall and made of cement like that. It\\u2019s dark. There\\u2019s water on the floor, about an inch of it, and it feels damp and cold. I\\u2019m inside with three people. We\\u2019re taking turns sleeping in shifts. We can only sleep for a maximum of eight minutes. We\\u2019re practicing a rotation that we can take this copper wire thing and roll it up into a key. It\\u2019s kind of shaped like a paperclip. We have to take it out of its shape and roll it into two other things within a certain amount of time. One of the shapes, you take one end and it ends up looking something like a flower. And the other, I\\u2019ve already forgotten what it looks like. We\\u2019re really, really tired. Everybody wants to sleep more than we are, but we can\\u2019t because we\\u2019re training ourselves to escape this place. We\\u2019ve got this old lumpy mattress on the floor so it keeps you off the water. There\\u2019s one set of sheets. The person who\\u2019s sleeping gets to stretch out and the rest of us are just sitting on something like one of those trundle buggies or wheely carts where you put things in them for shopping and they have a handle. Homeless people use them or the elderly. So we\\u2019re sitting on that to keep us up out of the water. So you not only have to be able to snap out of your sleep quickly, you also have to be dropped into your sleep quickly. If we can do all of this within eight minutes - fall asleep, wake up, fold the wire into the two different shapes - then we\\u2019re sure we can manage our escape. Everybody has to go through the rotation and there are four of us all together. So we do this. It repeats in the dream four times. One person has a really hard time waking up and it\\u2019s making all of us anxious. We\\u2019re shaking her and saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta get up! You\\u2019ve gotta get up!\\u201d She finally wakes up. We make her go through that a couple more times so she is waking up at the proper time. When she does, we take the sheets of the bed, but we have to leave the top cover on so it looks like people are still sleeping there because there\\u2019s somebody that comes around and checks and if they realize we\\u2019re gone before we\\u2019re all the way out of the building then we might get caught. So we have to practice taking the sheet off without disturbing the top cover. I\\u2019m actually quite good at this. We do it and I\\u2019m instructing the others, telling them how to do it. We do it, fold it up and put everything in this trundle buggie and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cGoats and Ethics\\u201d I\\u2019ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I\\u2019m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I\\u2019m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, \\u201cHmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really find any. Then I decide I\\u2019m not worried about it because I\\u2019ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I\\u2019m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I\\u2019ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don\\u2019t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I\\u2019m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He\\u2019s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, \\u201cYou have to see this, come with me.\\u201d We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn\\u2019t a yard; it\\u2019s a pool of water. But it doesn\\u2019t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, \\u201cThis is just amazing. You have to see this.\\u201d We bend down and look into the lake. She says, \\u201cLook what I found.\\u201d I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it\\u2019s not made of cement; it\\u2019s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, \\u201cLook! It\\u2019s a goat path.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don\\u2019t understand how it\\u2019s for goats.\\u201d So we\\u2019re kneeling at the side and she says, \\u201cLook.\\u201d I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re post holes.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.\\u201d She presses something and they start to go up - they\\u2019re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, \\u201cAt one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.\\u201d I think, \\u201cI wonder what the value is in that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell they would have used it when they were threatened.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, then, still I don\\u2019t understand what the goats did.\\u201d Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it\\u2019s not wood that things are made of and the reason they\\u2019ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, \\u201cWow, this is incredible.\\u201d Now other students are coming out and it\\u2019s 4:30. I realize it\\u2019s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can\\u2019t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can\\u2019t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.\"],[\"\\u201cSmoking\\u201d I\\u2019m on foot and it\\u2019s nighttime. I\\u2019m walking through a long flat path. There are a couple of other people with me - my ex friend Lisa and Keith - and a couple of other people. It\\u2019s pitch black out, the night sky has no moon and no stars. It\\u2019s not unpleasant - it\\u2019s not rainy or snowy - it\\u2019s just dark. We walk for quite some time. We are supposedly going to Keith\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s a cottage or something. We get there and his mom is home. We are supposed to just be stopping to say hi to her, change our clothes, and then put the boat in the water. I\\u2019ve already walked around the backyard to see where the boat is. I\\u2019m looking at the water. Everybody seems to be taking a long time, so I go back into the house. They\\u2019re involved in quite a conversation with his mom. I\\u2019m waiting for them to finish talking and I sit down. Then Omar walks into the room and he sits down. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re all talking but they\\u2019re not talking about anything, they\\u2019re just waiting. Eventually I sit down, too. I wonder why they\\u2019re sitting and waiting. I wonder what they're waiting for. I decide I might as well have a nap. There\\u2019s a pullout couch and it\\u2019s already been pulled out. I lie down on it. His mom comes over and sits beside me but she doesn\\u2019t say anything. She\\u2019s still in this kind of limbo. I\\u2019m not actually tired, I\\u2019m just lying down. Then the other guys get up as though they\\u2019re going to put their outdoor clothing on. I think we\\u2019re going, so I sit up on the corner on the pullout couch. But they\\u2019re not going; they\\u2019re passing around a joint. Then they go into this limbo again afterwards. I\\u2019m not sleepy, I\\u2019m just lying down because there\\u2019s nothing else to do. It\\u2019s pitch black. We\\u2019ve walked all the way there and I\\u2019m not going to walk home. I can\\u2019t go out in the boat by myself. Nobody is talking. I lie back down on the bed again. Then Keith comes over and he gives the joint to his mom. I wonder what\\u2019s in it and maybe it\\u2019s not a joint, but just looks like one. She puts it to her lips then takes it away and gives it to me. I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder what this is.\\u201d I put it to my lips. The smoke feels weird. I don\\u2019t like it. I take it away from my own lips and give it back to Keith. Then I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re all in limbo. They\\u2019re high.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cLittle Animals with Trunks on the Movie Set\\u201d This dream starts at the restaurant where I worked while at university. It\\u2019s a continuation of another dream where I heard they were hiring and I brought my application in. It starts by me meeting there with a bunch of other people I used to hang around with when I worked there. We are meeting there and it\\u2019s a Sunday night. We\\u2019re going to see a concert and the reason we\\u2019re meeting there is because the manager or one of the bartenders (I\\u2019m not sure who) has picked up a bulk purchase of tickets and we have access to them as employees at this bulk rate. I\\u2019ve been included in this. I\\u2019m feeling hopeful that I have a job there because I\\u2019ve been included. So, it\\u2019s shift change and I'm sitting at the bar with everyone else. Some of the staff are eating, which is typical - they\\u2019re getting their meal at the end of their shift. Some staff come in earlier and eat their staff meal before their shift starts. So there are a lot of people around and it\\u2019s a festive atmosphere. The people that have finished their shift are buoyant because they\\u2019re counting their tips. The people that are starting their shift are buoyant because there\\u2019s an anticipation of the money they\\u2019re going to make. There\\u2019s always good music playing there. I see people I went to highschool with. Their uniforms are all fresh and I can tell they\\u2019ve just been hired that day. I have a conversation with two of them. The tickets go around and I take mine. We\\u2019re figuring out who\\u2019s going to carpool with who and in what car. We\\u2019re waiting for the schedule to go up because it\\u2019s Sunday night. George, the manager, disappears into the back and somebody comments that he\\u2019s taking a long time to work on it. The crowd is thinning because people have finished their meal or left with their ticket and carpool or are on the floor starting to take care of their section. I\\u2019m still waiting to see if I\\u2019m on it because I\\u2019ve been included in this. George hasn\\u2019t come out from the back yet. I ask the owner who personally gave me a package with my ticket in it. Now I remember that they also had a small birthday celebration for me. Several people have given me a birthday gift and I didn\\u2019t expect this. I ask the owner if he knows if I\\u2019m on the schedule. He says he doesn\\u2019t know. He takes my hand and then leaves. One of the other managers is standing there, so I ask him. He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He has a sad look on his face. I feel really dejected and don\\u2019t even want to go to the concert now. I\\u2019m wondering why not only everybody who used to work with me has been re-hired, but these other people that went to highschool with and who never even worked there before have been hired. I leave. I get on the bus to go home. The bus is leaving and it does go down P. Road, but it stops and I disembark. It\\u2019s not just a bus stop, it\\u2019s an intersection of all different kinds of transportation. There\\u2019s a big ship at the dock. There are skateboards. There\\u2019s a snowmobile. There are other things I don\\u2019t remember. At first I choose a skateboard and it\\u2019s interesting because it is snowing. I\\u2019m surprised that as I go up a hill with snow that I can maneuver on this - it\\u2019s a combination of pressing my right foot down, then the left foot lifts up a little, and then you use your body weight and your center of gravity to heave it forward - it\\u2019s similar to skiing. I get up this very small hill then get some momentum and it\\u2019s going along in the snow. When I look down I can see the snowmobile tracks in the snow and they\\u2019ve hardened a bit in the cold, and it\\u2019s actually helping my skateboard to move along. I do this for a little while then get off the skateboard. Now I\\u2019m on some other kind of vehicle. It\\u2019s flying over the snow and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It has a steering mechanism. I am zooming along. It\\u2019s wide and there are a couple other people on it. I look over to the side and there are trees flying by. I can see an animal through the trees. I can\\u2019t figure out what kind of animal it is. At first I think it\\u2019s a warthog. Then I think it\\u2019s too big to be a warthog. Then I get a better glimpse of it. You know when things are speeding by and at first you can\\u2019t see something but then it\\u2019s almost like the thing that are speeding by are so fast that it looks like a motion picture and you can see what the other object is? It looks like a hippopotamus except it has wings and a trunk. Then I see all these other strange pictures. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow! This is the set from a Harry Potter movie!\\u201d I get excited about this. We get off at the next stop. Now my son is there and he gets off with me. I say, \\u201cDid you see that?!\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe animal through the trees!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, what did you see?!\\u201d I describe the process of first thinking it was a warthog then realizing what it was. He says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go take a look at the set!\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYou know what? If that\\u2019s the movie set, then we could actually rewatch that movie and look carefully at that scene through the trees and maybe see us flying by.\\u201d He gets really excited about this, too, and we decide to do that when we get home. Then we walk back the way we came on the vehicle. It\\u2019s taking us a little while to walk because we need to go back to that intersection of vehicles in order to get on one that will take us home. We\\u2019re almost there. We\\u2019re walking down the little hill that I skateboarded up with the snow. Then we decide to go off to the left and see if we can see anything else from the movie set. We get closer to it and there are extras and the caterers and those kinds of people milling about and doing their thing. There\\u2019s a commotion. We follow along with the crowd so we can see what the commotion is about. It\\u2019s a horse and it\\u2019s kicking another horse. I\\u2019m horrified. It\\u2019s just awful. I can hear the people on the set gasping and saying, \\u201cTake that thing out of the horse costume!\\u201d What\\u2019s happening is one of these trunked creatures is dressed up as a horse and the other horse thinks that the first horse\\u2019s spirit is bad so it\\u2019s kicking it because it doesn\\u2019t understand it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s another creature in it. They get the first horse calmed down and they remove the horse skin from the other one and put it into this pen. But the pen is a pit. There are a whole bunch of them in it and it\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s so inhumane. They\\u2019re all writhing around and all you can see are these little trunks. It\\u2019s so awful I wake up because I can\\u2019t stand looking at this or seeing this.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and it seems like some kind of celebration. It almost feels like a Christmas Open House or an informal reception of some sort. I\\u2019m wandering through the house looking for somebody I know. I don't see anybody when I go through the first three rooms. When I get to the backroom, I see my friend Kenny. He\\u2019s sitting with one of his sisters and both of his parents. I\\u2019m comfortable with them so I stay there. I don\\u2019t mingle. I just have conversations in turn with each of them until the event starts to wind down and the crowd starts to thin. Kenny leaves. I\\u2019m still taking to his sister; we\\u2019re having a bonding conversation about being the mother of boys. It\\u2019s time for her to go home and it\\u2019s just the parents left. They ask me if I would like a ride and I accept. I get into the car. I don\\u2019t know what happens to the mom, maybe we dropped her off earlier. I\\u2019m in the car now with the dad. He says to me, \\u201cIs it okay if we stop somewhere because I need to pick something up?\\u201d He tells me where it is and I say, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s only five minutes from my house.\\u201d We pull up and it\\u2019s a really tall apartment building. There\\u2019s a circular approach to it and he pulls up the car to the front of the main door. Then he says, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize you can\\u2019t park here. If I stay in the car while it\\u2019s running, do you mind going up and getting the parcel?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d He describes to me the floor that it\\u2019s on and tells me that I have to go down to the end of the hallway and it\\u2019s the last door on the right. He says it should be open. I follow the instructions and end up where he tells me. The door is open. I go into the hallway and see a parcel there and it\\u2019s bright orange, the kind of orange you\\u2019d see on a construction site. I pick up the parcel and exit the door backwards. I leave my left arm in the doorway, so it doesn\\u2019t make a loud noise as it closes. I\\u2019m starting to feel strange about being in somebody\\u2019s apartment when I don't know them and picking something up when I don\\u2019t know what it is. I\\u2019m walking down the hallway feeling kind of edgy. I see two people coming towards me from the end of the hallway. I overhear snippets of their conversation and realize they live in the apartment I just exited. I take note of what they look like. It\\u2019s a man and a woman. The woman is wearing a long nice pretty dress. They are both brown skin. Her hair is dark and pulled back in a bun. As I start to go down the stairs I\\u2019m feeling really unsure about what I\\u2019ve just done. When I get to the car, I share this with the dad. Before he answers or addresses my concerns, I see on the front seat of the car a folded up front page of a newspaper. The picture on it is a picture of my face as I\\u2019m running away from a building and the headline is \\u201cThis Place Has Been Robbed!\\u201d Now I am really distressed. I\\u2019m asking him. He told me it was okay what\\u2019s going on here but while I\\u2019m talking, he starts driving quickly away. Out from the underground parking lot comes a great big bright yellow ocre Cadillac. It\\u2019s the kind of Cadillac really old people drive. It\\u2019s really long and wide and doesn\\u2019t fit in parking spots anymore. I can see through the front windshield, the same man and woman I met in the hallway. I can hear the sound of the engine of the car roaring to live. It\\u2019s driving really quickly. They\\u2019re tearing up the road behind us. The dad speeds up and says he thinks he can lose them. He drives through the downtown to the other side of the city where there is a suburban area. It\\u2019s a quieter place. You can feel the quiet. It\\u2019s dark, nighttime. We drive up a really steep hill and he tells me to get out here and I'll be safe. I don\\u2019t know where I am in regards to my own house. I know I don\\u2019t feel safe, yet he doesn\\u2019t even turn the car off and everything happens so quickly that I feel like I have to get out now and don\\u2019t have time to ask questions because the time we gained on the car chasing us might be lost. I feel threatened as if my life is at stake. On the way I told him I wanted to go to the police. I don\\u2019t remember if he replied. Everything was happening so quickly. I get out of the car. I don't have the package - it\\u2019s not mine and I didn\\u2019t want it. I go in between two buildings - it's a really narrow asphalt pathway. Once I get behind the buildings, I\\u2019m in a square courtyard with all these big houses backed onto it. I\\u2019m standing there in the dark. It\\u2019s a quiet cushy kind of feeling there. I think, \\u201cAlright, I gotta get my bearings. I don\\u2019t have anything with me. How can I get the police and explain what actually happened because I\\u2019m being wrongly accused of something I was tricked into doing. Where is a phone? It\\u2019s nighttime. I need somewhere to sleep but I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019ll be safe.\\u201d My eyes adjust to the dark and I see I\\u2019m at the top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill is the woman from the hallway and in the car. She looks at me and I can tell that she recognizes me. She looks like she\\u2019s getting ready to run up the hill. But I have momentum on my side, so I run down the hill faster and faster and faster. My idea is to tackle her, to take her out, and then keep running until no one can find me. But she guesses what I\\u2019m going to do and ducks under. I roll through the air and we both land on our feet. We\\u2019re squaring off at each other, circling around and around. This is where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Spare Room\\u201d This dream is situated in the house that I lied in with my daughter, only it\\u2019s empty and I\\u2019m the age I am now. I\\u2019m moving into it with two girlfriends that I currently work with at the yoga studio. It\\u2019s move-in day but we don\\u2019t have any furniture, so we\\u2019re doing a walk-through. We look through the main floor. It looks clean. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one for everyone. The bathroom looks like it\\u2019s in good shape. They stay up on the top floor. They\\u2019re looking around in the bedrooms for some specific measurements or something. I go down into the basement. Although the basement looks clean and dry, there\\u2019s something creepy in it; it\\u2019s an energy that I feel. I walk over to the sliding patio glass doors. I look behind the blinds. I see an old man there. He\\u2019s gardening. I ask him if he needs anything. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m good thanks.\\u201d He\\u2019s in the backyard on the other side of the glass and I\\u2019m on the inside. I look down to see what he\\u2019s doing. He has a toolbox and he\\u2019s fixing something. I ask him if he\\u2019s going to need to come into the house. He replies in a voice like, \\u201cOh no no, I would never go in there.\\u201d I think he knows something about this creepy energy in the basement. Then I go back upstairs to the main floor. The other two girls are starting to bring in boxes and furniture. I\\u2019m helping with that, bringing in my own stuff. We each set up our bedrooms then go downstairs. They\\u2019re having trouble arranging the furniture in the living room. A couple pieces are mine, a couple pieces belong to each one of them and we\\u2019re just trying to group them together. I look at what they have and say, \\u201cHmm, it\\u2019s funny that this won\\u2019t fit because when I used to live here, I had the same pieces of furniture and they all fit just fine.\\u201d So we keep rearranging and put the couch on another wall and arranging the other stuff around it. We try this on three different walls when I say, \\u201cWait a minute, I know why this isn\\u2019t fitting! That one wall that goes from the main hallway downstairs to the stairs that go up is shorter than it used to be! What\\u2019s going on with that?\\u201d So I open the door to the closet. Now there\\u2019s a closet on that same wall. For some reason we haven\\u2019t put anything in it, nor did we open it when we did our inspection. I open it up and it\\u2019s giant. Then I close it again and look on the outside of the wall and say, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s why nothing will fit there! Somebody has removed part of the wall in order to make this closet twice as large.\\u201d Then we open the closet door again and this time there is a single bed, a dresser, and a couple of low tables in there. There\\u2019s a light from the ceiling. I say, \\u201cI wonder if they had this set up as an Airbnb room?\\u201d One of the other girls says, \\u201cOr maybe they just needed an extra bedroom?\\u201d Then we close the closet door again. I notice that there is a clothing bar running down the length of the ceiling. I think I say out loud, \\u201cI wonder where we can put our coats?\\u201d Then between the three of us we decide that since we only each have one coat, we can find room for it in our own closets upstairs. Then I open the closet door one more time because I want to check the workmanship to see if this has been a hack job or if it will stay as another bedroom. I\\u2019m kind of entertaining the idea of an Airbnb room in mind. But this time when I open it up there\\u2019s a little tiny crib along with the single bed and dresser. I\\u2019m wondering what happened to this person or the baby. It kind of looks like they still live here. Then I\\u2019m starting to wonder if there\\u2019s a connection between that and the presence in the basement that I feel. I\\u2019m still thinking about this as I go back upstairs to unpack more things in the bedroom. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cRe-living the Move\\u201d I\\u2019m re-living what I\\u2019ve been doing this last week, which is helping my daughter move from a big house into a tiny apartment. I\\u2019m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m in the kitchen and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m up in the attic and there\\u2019s stuff there. There\\u2019s a whole other apartment\\u2019s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she\\u2019s ever had since she was a kid and it\\u2019s all just everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess and it\\u2019s not sorted. She hasn\\u2019t packed any of it into boxes and she\\u2019s asking me to help her, but she\\u2019s not ready. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I\\u2019m in the attic and my friend is there. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s helping, she\\u2019s just sitting there and she\\u2019s talking. Her mood is light and she\\u2019s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They\\u2019re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They\\u2019re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I\\u2019m reaching in and at first I\\u2019m pulling out things that are just garbage and I\\u2019m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn\\u2019t belong with the toys. My friend says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and she says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let\\u2019s do it!\\u201d She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn\\u2019t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don\\u2019t really want to do this because I won\\u2019t be present for what I\\u2019m packing. Then I realize that maybe that\\u2019s silly because I\\u2019m just packing and maybe I don\\u2019t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn\\u2019t really affect me. It actually tastes like water, so that\\u2019s kind of strange.\"],[\"\\u201cBraids\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large crowd of people. Somebody that I\\u2019m working for has instructed me to make sure that no one\\u2019s hair is in their eyes. I\\u2019ve got this kit that has different things that can be braided into people\\u2019s hair and fastened so the braids don\\u2019t come out. There are quite a few different pieces and lots of different colors, so that no matter what color anyone\\u2019s hair is or what color their skin is, the braids will look attractive and match their own personal style. When I first start doing this I\\u2019m using a chart because some people have been sick. I\\u2019m in a white sterile type of environment. I kind of move through there braiding the hair of those I kind. It\\u2019s one long white room packed with people shoulder to shoulder. It\\u2019s kind of hard to maneuver around and do what I\\u2019m supposed to do. As I complete this task, the room leads into another room that is dark with no lights on. So instead of being really bright and whiite, it\\u2019s dark but also more colorful. There\\u2019s a stage and people are performing some kind of music up on the stage. It\\u2019s an open mic night, so it could be anybody. There isn't a full band, just one person at a time performing. While this is going on, I\\u2019m on the lower level around whoever is watching and doing their hair. Then I complete the braids of the people I\\u2019m supposed to. The next person is a guy that\\u2019s just finishing performing. He\\u2019s sitting off to the side of the stage. More people are coming from the audience and sitting on the side so you can hardly see where the stage is. It\\u2019s also dark. I\\u2019m wondering what I\\u2019m going to do with his hair because he has a scarf around his head, his hair is inside of it and he\\u2019s wearing a hat on top of that. I tell him what I\\u2019m here to do and he says, \\u201cOkay. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to do with it though.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell what would you like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m pretty happy with it the way it is.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine. Do you want me to just put a couple of pieces around the temples?\\u201d He takes the hat off and removes the scarf. His hair is all in cornrows. One of them is binding all of them into one large ponytail. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019ve been instructed to do his hair, it\\u2019s perfectly fine the way it is. So I just try and wrap the scarf around his head the way it was and fasten it a little more sturdily. While I\\u2019m doing this, I see my ex-best friend. She\\u2019s taking the stage and jumping up and down and waving her arms around, but that\\u2019s all she\\u2019s doing. She\\u2019s not singing anything, she doesn\\u2019t have any talent, she\\u2019s just jumping up and down trying to get people to look at her. Then I see her family coming up to watch her, but the parents have had two more children. I think, \\u201cWow, the mom is over fifty. The youngest is probably going to be orphaned soon. I wonder how fair that is to have kids at that age?\\u201d When her family arrives, she stops jumping up and down and pretends to be limping as though she\\u2019s sick. Everyone is rushing over to her and saying, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\\u201d I feel like oh there she goes again doing her antics. I don\\u2019t go over and speak to them. I pick up the things I was using for the hair. I say goodbye and thank you to the guy who had basically undid his perfectly good hair and let me touch it and do something with it that wasn\\u2019t even useful and then he put it back together himself. I walk back through the crowd. Now I look down. I\\u2019m sure I was completely dressed when I started this, but now I\\u2019m wearing a tanktop that\\u2019s one of those old man\\u2019s undershirts. My own underwear is white and baggy like an old man\\u2019s. I feel exposed and naked. I\\u2019m not comfortable with this. I don\\u2019t even want anyone to see me. I\\u2019m trying to shoulder my way back through the crowd and stay in the dark. I go into the washroom which is part of another big room - it\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s bedroom. It\\u2019s a really messy bedroom with clothes all over the place. I\\u2019m hoping I can find something to put on.\"],[\"\\u201cDeja Vu\\u201d The dream starts where I\\u2019m having a dream that I\\u2019ve had before. I\\u2019m in a different country, I think the UK. I\\u2019m walking down a street. It\\u2019s raining lightly and it\\u2019s dark. There are street lamps that are gas powered - the old wrought iron kind about nine feet high. The streets are made of cobblestone and are a bit slick. I walk through the streets. There are some people around and they\\u2019re wearing overcoats and bonnets. The men are wearing hats with a brim in the front and back. The overcoats have a top layer that comes from the neck and goes over the shoulders to the waist. I walk for a while then I come to the place where I know I\\u2019m supposed to go. I open the front door and walk up the stairs to the second floor and knock on the door. My boyfriend from high school opens the door. Inside, he\\u2019s got art easels and papers and paints and everything strewn around. There are plates with unfinished food. His kids look like they\\u2019ve been there but they aren\\u2019t there right now. I clear a space for myself to sit down. He\\u2019s not really looking at me. He\\u2019s opened the door but he hasn\\u2019t stopped what he\\u2019s doing to ask me why I\\u2019m there or greet me. I know this is typical of him, this is how he works. So I just sit and look out the window until he\\u2019s finished with what he\\u2019s doing. It feels like it takes ten minutes. Then, I don\\u2019t even know what he says to me. There\\u2019s just a break in the focus. I ask him how he\\u2019s been. I know I\\u2019m there because there\\u2019s something wrong with him but he doesn\\u2019t know this yet. Rather than say anything, he gestures with his arm that he\\u2019s been doing all this. He leaves the room and goes to a corner with a pile of stuff. He comes back with something and he shows me sketches. They\\u2019re quite good. It seems like he\\u2019s been working on this project. He starts to get his coat on. I know we\\u2019re leaving out the door to go somewhere else. We go back out onto the street. We\\u2019re going in the opposite way that I came and we go in through another door. It\\u2019s crowded and I don\\u2019t know anyone here, but he does. I\\u2019m waiting for him to finish doing what he has to do here so that I can talk to him. While he\\u2019s talking to a group of people, I\\u2019m looking at some things on a table. There\\u2019s a deck of cards. I take the cards in my hand and shuffle them. Then I lay eight out on the table. I turn over the fourth one and it\\u2019s hand-drawn like a cartoon style. The card shows a group of people. I hold it up and see that one of them is my high school boyfriend. I look and it\\u2019s a card that shows him sitting in the booth where he\\u2019s sitting surrounded by the people that are there including the ones that have their backs to me and the ones that are silhouetted. I put that card back down on the table. Then I turn up another one. It\\u2019s his apartment when he was younger before his hair was grey. It\\u2019s drawn in cartoon style. The drawings are done in a black marker, so they\\u2019re black and white illustrations. This one shows him younger working on these projects. So now I don\\u2019t want to turn any more cards over until I've had a chance to talk to him. I keep the ones that are still in my hand in my hand. I\\u2019m just waiting for him to finish. I can hear the hum of voices but I\\u2019m not really listening or trying to pull any conversation out. I\\u2019m just waiting and kind of disengaged because I\\u2019m focused on something else. Time passes, maybe a half hour, and he\\u2019s finished. He comes over. I know we can leave now. I show him the first card I turned over where he is the age he is now. He looks at it and pauses. Then I say to him, \\u201cThese look like your drawings. Did you draw these cards? Did you illustrate them?\\u201d I know as soon as I say it that he did. He looks thoughtful. Then I gather up the cards and take them with us. We walk back to his apartment. I sit down again. He goes back to his easel, his drawing board, and begins to draw. I know I\\u2019ve seen this before and have been here many times. Then the dream flips a switch. I\\u2019m at some kind of get together or dance. I see his parents. His mom is all excited because he\\u2019s coming home. She asks me if I\\u2019ve seen him yet. I say, \\u201cNo I haven\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you should come by.\\u201d I think she gives me a date. She says, \\u201cCome by and have some snacks with us.\\u201d I tell her that I will. I do. His family is there. I spend some time talking with his sisters. It\\u2019s joyous. It feels like Christmas. I\\u2019m talking to one of his brothers. I know I should tell him something, but I don\\u2019t get the chance because there\\u2019s so much talking and too many people around. Then he\\u2019s gone and he\\u2019s gone back to the UK.\"],[\"\\u201cBoard Games and Cereal\\u201d I\\u2019m leaving my house with a board game. It\\u2019s resting against my hip and I\\u2019ve got my left hand around the box to keep it closed. I\\u2019m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It\\u2019s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn\\u2019t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven\\u2019t fallen out. It\\u2019s old and the box doesn\\u2019t hold it\\u2019s shape very well because it\\u2019s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I\\u2019m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There\\u2019s somebody else but I can\\u2019t remember who it is now. We don\\u2019t have any front steps and it\\u2019s like a ramp. It actually feels like I\\u2019ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a long line of stores. We\\u2019re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there\\u2019s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there\\u2019s somebody else I know. They\\u2019re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don\\u2019t have masks on either. I note this and say, \\u201cWell, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!\\u201d We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I\\u2019m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, \\u201cThe cash register is over there and you have to line up.\\u201d Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they\\u2019re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They\\u2019re giving me cash. It\\u2019s not debit. I\\u2019m questioning this. The store owner comes back having finished organizing what she wanted to organize. She says, \\u201cThank you so much, I can take it from here.\\u201d I pick up my board game again. I see Julie, who I used to work with at the restaurant. I realize I\\u2019m wearing a hat, glasses and a mask and she\\u2019s probably not going to recognize me. She\\u2019s talking to somebody else I know who calls me over into the conversation. I say, \\u201cDo you know who I am?\\u201d She\\u2019s looking like she might. I take my hat off first and then I just take one of the loops of the mask from my ear quickly. She says my name and I put the mask and hat back on. She gives me a big hug and says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen you in so long.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019ve aged. You look fantastic.\\u201d I wait. She tells me about her life. This goes on for a little bit. I wonder if she\\u2019s going to tell me about her three boys. She tells me she\\u2019s in a new relationship. We say goodbye and she leaves. I notice that a piece from the board game, a house, is moving. It\\u2019s escaped from the box and is flying around. I shout this: \\u201cOh no! The house piece is on the move!\\u201d My kids are trying to catch it. They crawl underneath a cart that shopkeepers put out on the sidewalk for the day - it has legs and a bin and is made of wire. They\\u2019re crawling under these and one of them catches the piece and puts it back in the box. I\\u2019m feeling like we\\u2019ve been gone from the house too long. We turn around and start to make our way back home. I see somebody else on the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a stand up display that a man is hiding behind. He\\u2019s peeking to the person standing on the sidewalk. The person on the sidewalk is describing to us a little fearfully that somebody is spying on them. I don\\u2019t understand why they\\u2019re scared because it\\u2019s just somebody looking at them through a natural gap between the displays. I approach the guy that\\u2019s been accused of spying and say, \\u201cHey, how are you?\\u201d He says he\\u2019s good and he says, \\u201cLook. I can see the entire street through this little tiny gap.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s amazing.\\u201d He\\u2019s got pajamas over his clothes, but just the legs of pajamas. He\\u2019s wearing them like chaps, only they don\\u2019t have a belt. I say, \\u201cThis is interesting, what you have on your legs. May I ask what the purpose of it is?\\u201d He tells me it\\u2019s just a creative idea he had for dressing and he just likes it that way. It\\u2019s not for protection or anything like that. I say, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s very interesting.\\u201d Now the other person who was freaking out and accusing him of spying has been deflated and has stopped having a fit about it. The person that was accused, he was walking around and describing how he made these pajama bottom legs. He\\u2019s not peeking through the thing anymore. I guess that\\u2019s why the other person is okay now. Pajama-bottoms guy walks the opposite way and the other person continues across the street. Then I notice that the pieces of the board game are moving, they\\u2019re vibrating a lot. I\\u2019m saying to my kids, \\u201cWe really have to get home now or we\\u2019re going to lose control of these things and they\\u2019re going to fly out all over the place.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying that, the house piece flies out again. It goes way underneath this great big long outdoor bin of a different store. It goes far enough underneath that there are cobwebs. I\\u2019m not fantastically excited about chasing it under here but I do because the game is useless without that piece. I saw it go under there but it\\u2019s really dark. I feel around with my hand and there\\u2019s only one thing that\\u2019s not first so I grab it. It doesn\\u2019t look like the house piece anymore - it\\u2019s flat and not moving. I go back under there again to check around for anything else and there\\u2019s not. I put the piece in the box and am feeling like it\\u2019s not the piece. I\\u2019m already wondering where we\\u2019re going to get another one of those pieces. I know that we can\\u2019t. We continue on towards the house. There\\u2019s a guy I dated for a little while lingering around the outside. He\\u2019s trying to engage with my family. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t talk to him. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near us.\\u201d I don\\u2019t speak to him. He\\u2019s acting like I did. He\\u2019s smiling and being oblivious. He\\u2019s walking with my family. I\\u2019m getting really annoyed because he\\u2019s dense and acting like someone welcomed him in when nobody did. He follows us up the ramp and now he\\u2019s in the house. I\\u2019m ignoring him. He\\u2019s at my back. I set the board game down on the table. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says, \\u201cHere, if you put this on, it will take away all the pain from your neck, shoulders and back.\\u201d I look down and at first it looks like the thing a catcher wears in a baseball game. It\\u2019s made of this dark blue rough cotton stuff, like something a priestess would wear. It\\u2019s over my clothes. He\\u2019s pulling the drawstrings at the back tightly - they\\u2019re laces - the way someone would lace up the back of a corset. It\\u2019s very constricting and makes my arms stick out awkwardly by my side. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t want this. Can you please just get out of the house? You don\\u2019t live here. This is not your place.\\u201d He lies down on the couch and goes to sleep. I\\u2019m poking at him and he won\\u2019t move. I don\\u2019t know how to deal with this. I\\u2019m looking for my daughter to ask her if she can take these laces off and get me out of this thing. I go upstairs and there\\u2019s been a whole pile of people up there with a whole bunch of kids. They\\u2019ve gotten into everything. They\\u2019ve pulled it all out. I get the vacuum out and start vacuuming things up. You know when there\\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff in the rug and you can hear it clicking as it goes up the vacuum tube? I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019ll have to clean all this up with my hands. I start doing this. I realize there\\u2019s more furniture than will fit in the rooms and there\\u2019s stuff all over the floor. I\\u2019m trying to sort it out and figure out what goes in what room and what we really need. We need something to put towels in and there\\u2019s nothing in the bathroom and no cabinet. Where are we going to put all the towels? I go into my room. There\\u2019s stuff all over the floor! There\\u2019s this three year old kid and I don\\u2019t know who she belongs to. She\\u2019s dumped everything out onto the carpet. I pick it up and put it in bags. I think I\\u2019ve got as much as i can with my hands and start to run the vacuum. When I lift up the bedskirt to vacuum under the bed, the vacuum won\\u2019t go any further. I bend down and look. There are bags of oatmeal cereal that have been poured out and dumped. The oatmeal is eight inches thick. It\\u2019s all underneath the bed. My daughter comes in and knows I\\u2019m upset. She says, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cCan you please just keep picking this stuff up off the floor? Look, the vacuum isn\\u2019t even getting it all out.\\u201d Somebody has taken this black soil from a plant and it\\u2019s slightly wet so even when the vacuum goes over, it leaves a black stain everywhere. I\\u2019m overwhelmed with all the stuff that isn\\u2019t useful and is not in place and the people who aren\\u2019t listening to me and are in my house.\"],[\"\\u201cMaps\\u201d I\\u2019m driving around Toronto and I have to be somewhere at a certain time so that my son can attend the school. I have someone in the seat beside me, I think it might be my cycling friend. He\\u2019s fiddling with my radio and I\\u2019ve asked him not to because it\\u2019s connected to some kind of complex GPS in the middle of my steering wheel. If the radio stays on one station, then I\\u2019ve got wireless for my GPS. I've never been to this school before so I need to use the GPS, but normally I don\\u2019t use it to drive around Toronto because I know my way. So my son is in the backseat with his friend and they\\u2019re both going to this school, I think. My friend keeps fiddling with the radio and I keep saying, \\u201cWill you please stop doing that? I need it because I\\u2019m going to have to turn the GPS on in a moment.\\u201d It\\u2019s time to leave and drive my son to school. But he continues to fiddle with it and I\\u2019m getting a little annoyed with him. He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, you\\u2019ll be able to find the statio afterwards.\\u201d I press the buttons on the steering wheel because we\\u2019re now all in the car. Of course it\\u2019s dark and I can\\u2019t see very well. The traffic is crazy in Toronto. People get annoyed if you\\u2019re not driving quickly enough and the lanes are too narrow and there are too many cars. I put the coordinates in and see the lights flicker. The map comes to life and pinpoints where we are and where the school is. It\\u2019s on satellite view and I want to zoom in so I can see the street names so I have advanced warning for when I have to turn right or left because the traffic is so crazy here. That\\u2019s why I need the radio station to be on a certain channel. With my right hand, I'm turning it back to the channel I had it on and of course it\\u2019s static. I look over at my friend and say, \\u201cYou did mess it up. I need you to fix it and I need you to do it right away because I have to turn soon and I don\\u2019t know what street to turn on.\\u201d He fiddles around with it and puts it back on the station it\\u2019s supposed to be. I zoom in on the map on my steering wheel and see the names of the streets. Now I\\u2019m just driving there. The map has told me to go further. I\\u2019m at a traffic light and see ahead of me the highway which will take me out of town. Luckily there\\u2019s no one behind me or beside me because I have to pull a U-turn. I see the school and it\\u2019s not what the map said to do, but there it is. So I pull a U-turn, pull my car over where I\\u2019m not supposed to park and where nobody\\u2019s supposed to be. I tell the boys to get out, \\u201cQuickly just go run into your class!\\u201d It's portable and camouflaged so you can\\u2019t even tell it\\u2019s there. They get out. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll go park the car and I\\u2019ll be back in with your school bag. I\\u2019ll find you, don\\u2019t worry. Just get to your class on time.\\u201d They do. I find someplace to park the car. There\\u2019s a great big bin with hundreds of school bags in it. I don\\u2019t know which one is my son\\u2019s. I walk across the street, go up a couple of blocks, go to the portable and tell the teacher, \\u201cSorry, I don\\u2019t mean to bother you, but we had trouble getting here and I need to give my son his school bag.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, that's fine.\\u201d He\\u2019s writing a test. I sneak quietly between the rows of desks and they\\u2019re packed in really tight. I whisper to my son, \\u201cWhat is it that you need?\\u201d He tells me what it is - a pile of white papers. I wonder how I\\u2019m supposed to find it with that description. I turn around, go back out and go up the two blocks. I open the backseat of my car. I\\u2019m not sure if what I\\u2019m getting is correct. I gather it up and it\\u2019s not papers at all, they\\u2019re clips. They\\u2019re like the wire clips you put inside curtains to gather pieces together and hook them to a curtain rod - like you put eight or ten together on a long piece of fabric that has the holes in already. There are three prongs on the end of each curtain hook and you have to insert the curtain fabric up inside the prongs and it makes the curtain look like there are pleats in it. So there are twelve of these. I can barely hold them together in my hands. When I pick them up, one falls down and rolls underneath all the long lines of cars. I hear it stop and know it\\u2019s under a car, but it\\u2019s dark and I can\\u2019t see it. I spend some time looking for it, crawling under the cars in the mud. I still can\\u2019t find it. I need to get back and I\\u2019m not going to arrive in time, he\\u2019ll be finished. So I\\u2019m carrying these down the block and back to the school. As I\\u2019m doing this, the other kid who is his friend passes by me. He says my son needs me to get something, a pink binder. He\\u2019s very specific as he\\u2019s describing it. I think, \\u201cOh,that\\u2019s what he needs!\\u201d I go in anyway and tell the teacher that we have these clips that we thought we were supposed to prepare and my son has gathered them. I set them down. She\\u2019s sitting at a picnic table outside the portable, waiting for the kids to finish. As I\\u2019m setting them down, another one rolls in the grass and I hear it land. She saw it too. She looks around a little bit, too. I\\u2019m realizing that I did go back to the car and looked inside the bin and found the pink binder that the friend described. I took it back and gave it to my son. Now I\\u2019m sitting at the picnic table with the teacher. She says, \\u201cI need to talk to you about your son. He\\u2019s been getting really good marks but I\\u2019m not sure if he\\u2019s earned them.\\u201d I tell her that we just need to get him through high school and I realize some of the marks haven\\u2019t been earned but he tests brilliantly in his mind but he has a gap between getting the things from his mind onto a piece of paper. He\\u2019s entirely the kind of kid who needs to go to university where his mind is stimulated by something he wants to do. I say, \\u201cHe tests as though he can be a counselor or psychiatrist or something along that line where he\\u2019s working with people. He needs to finish high school to get there, so that\\u2019s why I haven\\u2019t said anything about some of the marks.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s the teachers that are giving him higher marks than he should be getting.\\u201d I shrug my shoulders because I\\u2019m not going to dispute that and I'm also not going to take it to task.\"],[\"\\u201cCottage in Mexico\\u201d This dream begins in the car. I\\u2019m driving with my younger brother. We\\u2019ve driven a long way and that part isn\\u2019t in the dream. I didn\\u2019t know where we were going, but it didn\\u2019t matter, it was a family road trip. I\\u2019m always only there just for the family time. I do get the sense there is wide open blue sky and red dirt. We come to a place where we stop. My brother lets me know that now we are going somewhere else, we\\u2019re not just driving around, we have a destination. We drive through a really dilapidated town. The sky has a certain color because it is reflecting a large body of water. It looks like water is not that far away. My brother drives the car through an area with houses. He says, \\u201cWe bought a cottage.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at a ten by ten shack. The bottom part doesn\\u2019t even have wood. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cReally, you bought that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Turn around behind you.\\u201d I see a much larger building. It\\u2019s also not in very good condition, but it\\u2019s livable. There\\u2019s a great big backyard. We pull the car then my parents pull up - they\\u2019ve been driving towards the same destination - and then my other brother pulls up in his car. So we have three cars. My other brother has the trailer attached to his. We go in the house. We start opening windows, turning lights on, bringing some things from the cars - suitcases and stuff, but no furniture. The cottage is already furnished. There are three floors. The upstairs is a sleeping floor. The main floor is the kitchen and a living area. The bottom floor is one big long room with twenty tables with chairs around them. I realize as I\\u2019ve gone through all the floors that it has been set up as a retreat area. I ask my sister-in-law, \\u201cAre you guys going to start having retreats?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to set it up as a single family dwelling.\\u201d Then we start sweeping. We\\u2019re sweeping out the main floor first and getting the kitchen ready. My stepmom is doing some dishes because there\\u2019s dust on everything. We\\u2019re taking stock of what\\u2019s there. There\\u2019s enough that they don\\u2019t need to bring any of their own stuff. At this point, my young nephew, he\\u2019s only one, starts to get tired. My sister-in-law says we should go upstairs and sort out the sleeping arrangements. I follow her up. The bedrooms upstairs are small. We\\u2019re counting them and trying to see who\\u2019s going to sleep where. When we\\u2019re in one of the bedrooms, I look out the top window to see an amazing view of the ocean. I\\u2019m standing there looking at it for a little bit. My nephew crawls over and I can feel him tugging on my leg and he\\u2019s standing. I pick him up and we\\u2019re both looking out the window at the water. My sister-in-law comes over and says she has a bath ready for him. She takes him. I find some sheets.i\\u2019m starting to put them on all the beds. I finish that. I can still hear my nephew and sister-in-law in the bathroom. I go downstairs and my brother is in the kitchen. I ask him, \\u201cAre you guys moving here? This is a long way to go.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve been working from home for a while, so I\\u2019m thinking we can stay down here for up to six months and then we\\u2019ll go back home.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a good arrangement. He says, \\u201cYeah, except I\\u2019m broke now.\\u201d I wonder why he bought this. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did you buy this so you can flip it?\\u201d He\\u2018s really handy. He says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to keep it. My contract is almost due anyway.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking this doesn\\u2019t really add up. I say, \\u201cWell, I'm really going to miss you living down here. Although I've been waiting myself to be able to get a cottage in Ireland or Scotland area, I just love it over there. I can just get something small. But it\\u2019s hard to do those things by yourself, especially if it needs work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I get that.\\u201d Then I go down to the main floor. My sister-in-law is there by herself so I\\u2019m assuming she\\u2019s put my nephew to bed. She opens up one of the cupboards and pulls something out. It looks like a long braid of sweetgrass. It\\u2019s long enough that she\\u2019s holding it in both of her hands. It looks like it\\u2019s been wrapped in parchment paper and it\\u2019s really dry, you can see little bits of it have crumbled off. I ask her what she\\u2019s going to do with it. She says, \\u201cWell, I think I\\u2019ll just burn it and see what it smells like.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking through other drawers for a lighter. I turn around and she\\u2019s found something to light it with. The smell is drifting over to me and I say to her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sweet grass. That smells like marijauna.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh!\\u201d But she continues to smell it. Then I see that my nephew is not in bed, he\\u2019s playing on the floor in the other room. I tell her we need to take this upstairs and open all the windows so the smell doesn\\u2019t affect him. She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She starts following me but she\\u2019s having to walk really slowly because the paper is really flimsy and the stuff is so dry that if you walk fast, it will fly out and get all over the floor which is also dangerous. She\\u2019s walking so slowly that the smoke is filling up the room. I\\u2019m looking around. Now I notice that the kitchen doesn\\u2019t have any windows. We are on the stairs now and I\\u2019m standing behind her to hide her from the others. We get to the next floor and into the closest bedroom. We open the bedroom door and then I say to her, \\u201cWell what are we going to do with it now? There\\u2019s nowhere to set it. Maybe we should just put it out in water.\\u201d She\\u2019s trying to use the parchment paper to pinch the burning parts and put the fire out. She says, \\u201cI think I want to save this.\\u201d I laugh and say, \\u201cI know for those times when somebody else is sleeping.\\u201d We both laugh and I say, \\u201cYeah, there\\u2019s too much of this to throw out.\\u201d Then we both start pinching it to try and put it out. We finish doing that then we wrap it up like a tube and twist the ends - it\\u2019s like a giant long skinny candy. I hear some voices downstairs. We just leave it. We close the bedroom door and go back downstairs to the kitchen. There are two Mexican men and one of them has some paper money in his hand. He\\u2019s talking to my brother. They\\u2019re asking if they can buy the furniture that\\u2019s in the recreation room downstairs. He\\u2019s agreeing to do it. The guy is telling him that he\\u2019s offering him 50 Canadian dollars for each setting. I\\u2019m close enough to see that it\\u2019s not dollars but pesos, but he\\u2019s said it in Spanish and he said \\u201cdolares.\\u201d So when my brother goes down to start counting all the chairs and tables to do the math I run after him to try and talk to him without the other guys hearing me. I say, \\u201cThose aren\\u2019t dollars, they\\u2019re pesos. So he\\u2019s giving you fifty pesos which is way way way less than the dolares.\\u201d My brother is listening to me and we do a calculation and he goes back to haggle with them. I\\u2019m trusting that he now knows the information and will make a fair deal. Now we\\u2019re going around the tables and my stepmother is in the room, too. It\\u2019s dark. We haven\\u2019t figured out where the lights are. The tables are all identical, but the chairs are all different. There are more chairs than tables. I see that there are two press-backed rocking chairs randomly placed at the tables. These rocking chairs are exceedingly more valuable than the other ones. I\\u2019m trying to pull those out. There\\u2019s another chair that is quite intricate and I\\u2019ve put the three of them against the wall. I\\u2019ve set the other identical chairs around the table so they get sold. My stepmom sees what I\\u2019m doing and she\\u2019s also organizing the chairs so that the ones that get sold are the ones of lesser value and also fit with the tables. The men take them out to their truck and disappear. It\\u2019s like a ballroom now. It has a completely different feel with those business tables and chairs gone and just those two rocking chairs and the intricate chair. My stepmom and I place them together in the middle of the room. I\\u2019m thinking it would be nice to have a fireplace here. We leave the basement and go back up. My brother is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWow, I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll ever see you guys again.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, return tickets are $893. That\\u2019s not bad. You can visit and stay as long as you want. All you have to pay for is your flight.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYeah, but I\\u2019d need to bring both of my kids, too, and $893 times three is like $2,900 or something.\\u201d I feel really sad because I don\\u2019t think I can afford to go down and see him when he\\u2019s there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sound\\u201d I\\u2019m on my way or coming from somewhere. I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven\\u2019t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We\\u2019re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It\\u2019s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can\\u2019t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they\\u2019re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it\\u2019s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they\\u2019re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn\\u2019t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, \\u201cYes, I know. I don\\u2019t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, are you coming for Trina\\u2019s fiftieth birthday?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t know about that, but maybe.\\u201d She writes the date down and tells me it\\u2019s going to be on April first. When she\\u2019s writing this down I say, \\u201cYou know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn\\u2019t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll put my phone number down here, too.\\u201d She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have yours either.\\u201d She gives me another piece of paper, it\\u2019s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I\\u2019m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it\\u2019s so small that there isn\\u2019t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, \\u201cHmm, there\\u2019s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d While she\\u2019s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I\\u2019m doing this, she says to me, \\u201cHave you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they\\u2019re trying to change things in this town.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow they must really have their work cut out for them because there\\u2019s so much dark horribleness in this place.\\u201d She\\u2019s telling me that there\\u2019s a movement against them coming in. I just say, \\u201cNo, I didn\\u2019t know about either one.\\u201d Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I\\u2019m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I\\u2019m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I\\u2019ve asked her for a drink of water which I\\u2019ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it\\u2019s windy and they\\u2019re blowing open. So I\\u2019m trying to pee as I\\u2019m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it\\u2019s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, \\u201cCome back anytime.\\u201d I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there\\u2019s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way. I just press his phone number to see if he\\u2019s home because I don\\u2019t want to go out there if he isn\\u2019t. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Baby\\u201d I\\u2019m in an arena, the kind where people have hockey games and figure skating competitions. I\\u2019m carrying a baby, maybe about 4-6 months old. I\\u2019m walking around the arena. I see one of the managers from the restaurant where I used to work, Blake. I don\\u2019t approach him yet. I go into one of the change rooms. Nobody is in it. I see one of those dropdown beds that you push into the wall. I drop it down and I lie down on it with my baby and I begin to nurse her. I finish that. She\\u2019s happy and fed. I put her in a sling attached to my body and open the arena door and go out onto the ice. I\\u2019m skating. I skate around and around and around. I\\u2019m enjoying myself. The baby is liking this, too - I can see her smiling face inside her hat and she\\u2019s laughing. A good deal of time passes and I think that\\u2019s enough. We go back and I open the heavy arena door, it\\u2019s kind of hard with a baby in a sling in front of my body. I step down a step and go back to the change room. I stop because Blake comes in the door and tells me that I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that in the arena without something from the drug store, I can\\u2019t remember what. I say, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize that.\\u201d So, I put my coat back on and the baby is still in the sling. We walk out of the arena, down the long ramp, down a few blocks to the drug store. I\\u2019m in the drug store and looking at all these baby products. I think I don\\u2019t need any of these things. I leave the store and go back to the arena. As soon as I arrive, Blake comes back out again and he\\u2019s questioning me. I am trying to tell him that I know what I\\u2019m doing, but he\\u2019s agitated. He follows me into the change room. I want to lie down again and nurse my baby. He\\u2019s telling me I\\u2019m doing a whole bunch of things wrong. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s four pillows on the bed, it will be fine.\\u201d He leaves but he\\u2019s exasperated with me. I nurse my baby again and then she\\u2019s tired so I let her rest. I pile the pillows up around her. Because Blake has made me question myself, I stand there for a moment and think, \\u201cIs there any way that she would be ready to start crawling and get out of these pillows?\\u201d I\\u2019m positive that she\\u2019s not ready. I leave the change room and go out into the arena foyer. Now there\\u2019s a big lineup and it\\u2019s no longer an arena. At the end of the ramp where the door opens is a pier where a ferry backs in so people can drive onto it and go across the lake. While I\\u2019m standing there, I see one of my son\\u2019s friends and his mom and they\\u2019re waiting in the lineup. There are two different lineups about two feet apart. I\\u2019m standing between them. They both have a different agenda. The mom is going one place and her son is going another place. They\\u2019re arguing because the mom is saying one thing but her son is contradicting her saying, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it says in the Bible.\\u201d I wonder when he started being interested in that because he certainly wasn\\u2019t all the years he was friends with my son. I think he deserves to be listened to. I ask him a couple questions about why he\\u2019s making that statement and why he has to go this way. He explains it to me. I think that makes sense and I guess really the only way to find out is if you actually get on the ferry and go to the destination and see if all those white rocks are actually there. I wish him good luck or the best or safe journey or something. I turn to the mom and say, \\u201cI think he\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t talk to me, she just keeps looking straight ahead and she had the whole time she was standing there. I turn around and walk back through the lineups and up the ramp, back to the arena and into the change room where my baby is still sleeping. I decide that I\\u2019m tired and I lay down beside her, put my head on the pillow and go to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cCourt Date\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house I used to live in and it was the top floor of a bungalow and in the basement was a doctor\\u2019s office. I\\u2019m in the back bedroom. I\\u2019m sitting on my bed and I have a laptop in front of me. I\\u2019m also curling my hair, which is extremely strange because I have naturally curly hair and I\\u2019ve never used a curling iron in my life. I take a piece of my hair and I put it between the mouth of the curling iron and I pull the curling iron all the way to the end the way I\\u2019ve seen other people do, which actually straightens my hair, then I wrap the curling iron around my hair and I hold it and then I unwrap it. Instead of my hair being curly, it\\u2019s straight. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m doing this and don\\u2019t understand why I would do this. I have this dream consciousness that is confused and then there\\u2019s another consciousness that is also saying, \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t even work! It doesn\\u2019t even curl my hair the way it\\u2019s supposed to!\\u201d My son is only about eight years old in the dream and he\\u2019s occupying the other back bedroom. I know he\\u2019s there because I can hear him moving around. Since I hear him moving around, I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts on the two documents I\\u2019m writing on my laptop so I don\\u2019t lose my train of thought because I\\u2019m going to do a board game with him or something. I want to see what he wants to do now that he\\u2019s awake. It\\u2019s morning. I have been up for quite a while. He has just woken up and I can hear this because there\\u2019s movement. I look on the laptop and I\\u2019ve got one document open where I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts and focus for an upcoming court case with my son\\u2019s father. The other one is something that I\\u2019m writing as a creative project that I\\u2019m not sure is for school or just enjoyment. I click into the court case one because that one\\u2019s more important and has a date coming up soon. I\\u2019m trying to sort out the threads in my head of how the court date arose, what the reason is for it. It\\u2019s really hard to sort out because I don\\u2019t want to make it into an attack on my son\\u2019s dad\\u2019s character, yet every reason I would put in there that I would say anything about is also going to be something to do with his character. I think this is why it\\u2019s so hard to write. If it wasn\\u2019t for his character, there wouldn\\u2019t be a court case. But he continues to lie and doesn\\u2019t follow through on any of the custody conditions. He just doesn\\u2019t do them then lies and says he was. So I typed five words out then keep deleting them. I close the laptop and get up to leave the room, but the door opens and my son is standing there. I ask him what he would like to do today. He says that he wants to go out to someplace. I get up and we go out into the kitchen to have breakfast first, but his dad is standing there. I\\u2019m confused as to how he got in the house. He\\u2019s in the kitchen and he\\u2019s making a piece of toast or sandwich or something and is carrying it out into the living room. He lies down on the couch and puts the sandwich on his chest and turns the tv on. I feel that this is somehow a violation of not only the custody arrangement but of my own personal space. Then my son goes into the living room and is watching the television, only it\\u2019s guys out on the town and it's really inappropriate for an eight year old boy to be watching. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat kind of arrangement is this?\\u201d I could have sworn he had his own place. I\\u2019m standing there in the kitchen trying to sort that out in my head. I\\u2019m wondering why I don\\u2019t remember this. Then I think of twelve other times recently where he\\u2019s been in the house and I start to doubt myself and think maybe I don\\u2019t have my own space and maybe he does live here and maybe this is what the court case is about because we still have to have personal time with our son. But since he\\u2019s making the sandwich and turning the tv on, it\\u2019s eroding my son\\u2019s attention and he\\u2019s just going over to the tv and now I\\u2019m not getting my own time with my son because of what his dad is doing. I walk back down the hall to the bedroom. I go back to the laptop because I think maybe there\\u2019s a document to help me remember whose day this is supposed to be and what the arrangements are because I didn\\u2019t think he was living with us. As I\\u2019m looking for that, my son comes into the bedroom. I say, \\u201cOh good, you\\u2019re back.\\u201d I close the laptop and think maybe I don\\u2019t have to sort this out. I say, \\u201cWould you like to play a boardgame?\\u201d He says yes. I say, \\u201cGood.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ve got this pinball machine in the closet that would be really interesting to play plus it would be good for his hand eye coordination and I like that it\\u2019s not television, it\\u2019s the opposite, it\\u2019s something you kind of do with your body. I say to him, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just play this for a few minutes. Then we can go out for a walk because it\\u2019s snowing out and it\\u2019s really pretty.\\u201d He says that he would like to do that. I show him how to pull the big plunger back, then watch it hit the ball, then the ball goes up and hits the other lights. I say, \\u201cThen you have to move this way, then you have to move that way because you want the ball to hit the paddle, then you use the flippers to hit it. We\\u2019re trying to get it to go into this part of the tube.\\u201d He does and he tries but he doesn\\u2019t pull the plunger back far enough and he gets discouraged. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay, here try it again, it\\u2019s alright.\\u201d But he only pulls it three times and gets discouraged again and wants to go out and lie on the couch with his dad and watch tv. I feel really defeated by this because that\\u2019s all his dad does. I tell him, \\u201cWell, your dad\\u2019s not supposed to pick you up at four, so let\\u2019s go for a walk, let\\u2019s go outside and walk through the snowflakes.\\u201d But then his dad comes down to the room and opens the bedroom door and bends down and picks him up and takes him back into the living room. Now I feel really resigned. I sit back on the bed, open up the laptop, and from my own memory, I\\u2019m typing out what I remember the custody arrangement to be. Every time I type a sentence, the computer erases it. There\\u2019s something wrong with the computer. Then I think that maybe if I record my voice and do text to talk, that will work, then I\\u2019ll just fix the typos that those things always make after. I'm trying to do that. Then I hear my ex going out the door. I hear the front door shut. I look out and he\\u2019s taken my son and gone. So I go out the front door and think that at least I can go for a walk now. I go out onto the back porch. It\\u2019s a beautiful sunny day. My phone rings. It\\u2019s my friend who lives in Holland now and I haven\\u2019t talked to in years. I tell her, \\u201cOh, hi!\\u201d I\\u2019m excited to hear from her. I notice she has a Dutch accent now and she didn\\u2019t when she lived in Canada and I think that\\u2019s from being in Holland for so long. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m just about to go for a walk, but I\\u2019d really love to talk to you. Can I call you back later?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell I only have time to talk right now.\\u201d I notice as I\\u2019m talking to her that my son is on the stairs at the bottom of the deck. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing there because he was supposed to be with his dad. I tell my friend, \\u201cI actually can\\u2019t talk to you right now because my son is here.\\u201d She sounds really disappointed, but I promise to call her back. I hang the phone up then these two men come walking up the back porch and I realize that they\\u2019re for the doctor who lives in the basement because this happens all the time between the hours of 8-4. It\\u2019s a man and his twelve to fourteen year old son. They\\u2019re walking together and the dad\\u2019s taking him to the doctor\\u2019s office. They\\u2019re about to go in when the man looks at me and says, \\u201cBathe me.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019m not going to do that!\\u201d He pulls up a chair and another for his son. His son sits in one of the chairs. He sits in the chair and crosses his ankle over his thigh and sits back a little bit, then he crosses his hands over his chest. Then he looks at me and says, \\u201cIf you come here I\\u2019ll tell you why that\\u2019s funny.\\u201d His son has a smirk on his face and so does the dad. I think he\\u2019s genuinely trying to tell me a joke. He looks completely harmless and his body movements are such that he\\u2019s still trying to keep the time for his appointment. I think, \\u201cShould I let him just tell his joke?\\u201d I start to walk over in front of him so he can give me the punch line, then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Songwriter\\u201d I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It\\u2019s like a small theatre, so it\\u2019s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they\\u2019re hosting a band. I don\\u2019t sit at one of the seats though, I\\u2019m standing at the back. I\\u2019m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I\\u2019m listening to the lyrics because I\\u2019m familiar with them. I\\u2019m really just wanting to enjoy how they\\u2019re paired with the melody. We\\u2019re about four songs in. He sings this one and it\\u2019s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I\\u2019m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn\\u2019t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight\\u2019s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I\\u2019m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he\\u2019s finished and, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to tell you about that song.\\u201d I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It\\u2019s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It\\u2019s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, \\u201cOh, where did this come from?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI found it in your friend\\u2019s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he\\u2019s dead.\\u201d It\\u2019s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn\\u2019t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn\\u2019t really grieved his friend\\u2019s death. That\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It\\u2019s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, \\u201cNo way, he wouldn\\u2019t have written this for me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.\\u201d I can see it\\u2019s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I\\u2019m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It\\u2019s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d How could there be any other result here other than he\\u2019s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?\\u201d He\\u2019s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he\\u2019s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, \\u201cThank you for showing me this.\\u201d We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Protective Glasses\\u201d I go back to the same theatre. This time I\\u2019m with my daughter. We\\u2019re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I\\u2019m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There\\u2019s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There\\u2019s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they\\u2019re closing them and stuff, but we\\u2019re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we\\u2019re standing there and we\\u2019re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don\\u2019t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: \\u201cWhat are those glasses you\\u2019re wearing? Are they protective somehow?\\u201d She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHmm, wow, maybe they do work,\\u201d kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there\\u2019s an indoor pool. It\\u2019s the same thing where we\\u2019re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you\\u2019re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it\\u2019s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they\\u2019re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don\\u2019t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can\\u2019t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher\\u2019s attention and say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s in there, she\\u2019s in the pool.\\u201d I go back outside so I\\u2019m behind the glass and I\\u2019m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I\\u2019m scanning the water, there\\u2019s no daughter. I\\u2019m starting to get scared and thinking, \\u201cAre they so busy testing everyone that they\\u2019re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?\\u201d I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to be in here! You can\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for my daughter! She\\u2019s underneath the water. She\\u2019s not surfacing.\\u201d They look and she\\u2019s not in there. Now I\\u2019m really scared, like, \\u201cWhat the heck? Where is she?\\u201d The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She\\u2019s definitely not in the pool. We\\u2019re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I\\u2019m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She\\u2019s coming from the back of the pool. They\\u2019re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?\\u201d She says, \\u201c Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.\\u201d I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I\\u2019m upset with her.\"],[\"\\u201cWheat\\u201d I\\u2019m eating supper with my friend who is a dietician and her family. She has four kids and her husband is there, too. She\\u2019s describing to me the benefits of a plant based diet and invites me to stay for supper. I agree because I think it\\u2019s going to be all plant based food, but instead, she dishes out pasta like spaghetti that already has tomato sauce mixed in with it, and starts putting it on everybody\\u2019s plates. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you, I can\\u2019t eat wheat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, hmm, that\\u2019s all we have.\\u201d I say,\\u201dThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m used to not eating anything as opposed to eating wheat and suffering through the effects of it for weeks to come.\\u201d When her family is finished eating I notice that hardly any of her kids ate all the pasta. She just scrapes it all into the garbage. I wonder why she\\u2019s feeding her family stuff like this when she\\u2019s been advocating this plant based diet and also creating such waste. I find this puzzling.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Stairs\\u201d I\\u2019m in kind of like an office building, that\\u2019s what it feels like. Everything is that institutional color, white or grey. There are a lot of windows but no design or creativity to the architecture, it\\u2019s just put together. The dream begins on the bottom floor. There is one couch and a whole bunch of boxes of clothes. I\\u2019ve brought one of them here with my daughter\\u2019s clothes from where she was four and five. I brought them because her godparents at the time, their daughter is three and most of the clothes have only been worn a couple of times so they look brand new, including this pair of white girls shoes that you put on for special occasions. She only had them on for one two-hour thing, it was a funeral, and I carried her for most of it. The godparents are looking through their daughter\\u2019s own clothes trying to find a pair of shoes. I tell them that there\\u2019s a pair that I brought in the box of clothes. The godmother says nothing and continues to look through the boxes of clothes as though I haven\\u2019t spoken. Her husband says, \\u201cOh thanks, that would be great! Where is the box that you brought?\\u201d I tell him, \\u201cI put it over there.\\u201d He goes that way and starts looking for it. In the meantime, I\\u2019m sitting on the couch with their daughter. She normally doesn\\u2019t laugh and I know this. She doesn\\u2019t express her emotions very well. I\\u2019m very careful not to pick her up and toss her around the way some adults do with the kids or disrespect her space. I just sit on the couch and if she wants to come over, she will. I look at her and talk to her. I notice that she has a really old face for a three year old. I find this compelling. I\\u2019m really paying attention because I think she has some wisdom that has perhaps been overlooked due to the fact that she\\u2019s in a three year old body. She eventually toddles over and sits on my lap. She\\u2019s facing me and she grabs my hands. You know how kids run up your body and then they somersault while they\\u2019re holding your hands? She does that. I\\u2019m a little surprised because I know she\\u2019s reputed to be standoffish; however, I\\u2019m quite familiar with this move so we do it. After the second one she starts to laugh and her parents look at me with some surprise. The mom looks annoyed and comes over and tries to grab her, but she says no to her mom and does the somersaults a few more times and is laughing. By this time, I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I ask the child if it\\u2019s okay if I set her down on the couch. She says she doesn\\u2019t want me to do that. I say, \\u201cOkay, how \\u2018bout we stand up and help look in the boxes?\\u201d She agrees to do this but wants to be carried. I shift her so she\\u2019s balanced on my left hip. We walk towards her dad who finds the shoes at that moment. He says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s get you dressed.\\u201d I give her to her dad. Now I\\u2019m on some kind of rescue mission and am supposed to go up to the top floor of the building. I walk over to the stairwell. It\\u2019s like if you look at stairs from the side of the building and you can see that there\\u2019s a forty-five degree angle going up and then another one going up, and you can see all these angles, but you can also see the ones going down as if you\\u2019re right beside it and seeing through the glass. They look like this when I\\u2019m trying to go up them. The down-going stairs are mixed in with the up-going stairs. The first time, it\\u2019s quite clear to me and I can see the up-going stairs anyway. I go to the top floor where I\\u2019m supposed to be. There\\u2019s a woman and I have an appointment with her. I make it for the appointment. She talks to me but I don\\u2019t remember what we say to each other. She gives me some kind of assignment that I\\u2019m responsible for. I take it. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s something physical; it\\u2019s something in my mind. I accept it. I go back down the stairs. I realize that I have a question that I\\u2019m uncertain about. As soon as I get to the bottom I want to go back up the stairs. I do one flight and then the down-going stairs exerts itself in front of me. I go down one flight anyway because I have to in order to access the up-going stairs. But the access for the up-going stairs isn\\u2019t there, so I go down one more flight thinking I\\u2019ll find it but I don\\u2019t. Now I\\u2019m feeling concerned because I\\u2019ve gone down two flights of stairs and I don\\u2019t want to be down here. I see the door open and it\\u2019s really dark where that person has come from - it\\u2019s like an underground parking lot with that creepy kind of feel to it. I think if I watch what they\\u2019re doing then I can find the up-going stairs. But they\\u2019re running really quickly. I can hear their footsteps going up but I can\\u2019t see what path they\\u2019ve taken. I follow the up-going stairs anyway. It takes me back up the two flights that I mistakenly descended. Then I\\u2019m trying to continue going up back to the offices but the down-going stairs keeps mixing up. This time I\\u2019m smarter and I don\\u2019t take the down-going flights, I just keep trying to find the up-going ones. After a little while I realize I can\\u2019t and think I\\u2019ll have to go on the mission anyway with these questions in my mind.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Colourful Night\\u201d I\\u2019m with my first boyfriend. It feels like we\\u2019re in Mexico. There\\u2019s a beach and an ocean. It\\u2019s nighttime but there are so many colors of lights and festivities of people gathered together. The sounds of music and lights are all off in the distance. I\\u2019ve been to Mexico and it feels like that colorful joyous culture. We\\u2019re walking along the beach at night. He\\u2019s telling me that he\\u2019s only here for a little while. I feel a bit sad about that. I want him to stay longer. As we walk a little farther on, it\\u2019s really pretty. It\\u2019s a white sand beach and there\\u2019s a moon. You can tell the color of the sand because the moonlight is bright. We approach a path leading down to the beach from somewhere else, and I can see it in the darkness. We turn up it and start to move away from the beach. There\\u2019s a night market with crafts and people who have made crafts and set up a makeshift vendor tent out of a few simple poles and some canvas or fabric. There are a lot of these makeshift tables. There\\u2019s a camaraderie kind of atmosphere as we walk through. They\\u2019re background noise though because we\\u2019re in conversation with each other and we\\u2019re walking through the market, we\\u2019re not stopping at the vendors or looking at their crafts or what they have to offer. We come to another path. We turn up it, away from the vendor market. It\\u2019s like beach apartments, flat, one level and very simple, obviously places where people sleep because the sound from the market and ocean is reduced here. I suddenly realize that I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re sleeping - I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s sleeping or where I\\u2019m sleeping. I\\u2019m getting tired and want to lie down and rest. He says we can sleep here for the night and indicates a door on his right. He says it belongs to his brother. So we open the door and right inside the door is a bed. We lie down on the bed and I close my eyes for a few minutes. I wake up and feel like it\\u2019s not that much longer but he\\u2019s behind me and his arm is around me. It feels soothing even though I\\u2019m awake and listening to the sounds around me. In a little while, he wakes up. We both sit on the bed and have a conversation where I tell him that I want him to stay longer. He says he can but there are a few conditions. He wants to be able to work on his art and he wants his own space. There was something else he wanted, but I can't remember. I think, \\u201cOkay, these are easy to fulfill and he already does that anyway.\\u201d Without any second guessing or additional contemplation, I agree. He seems really happy about this and so am I. We leave the apartment and walk back through the marketplace. We go a little farther and there are some raw materials like clay and wood. He\\u2019s poking through those looking for something he can use. I\\u2019m doing the same thing but not with the same materials. Some other people start to infiltrate the environment where we\\u2019re doing this right now. They\\u2019re talking to me and asking me what I want to use these materials for. They\\u2019re asking what he wants to use these for, too. There\\u2019s the feeling that they are causing a disconnect between us. I don\\u2019t want to answer all these questions. It doesn't matter to me what they think. I just want to collect my materials and see if he\\u2019s ready to go. That\\u2019s how the dream ends with this constant onslaught of interruptions that are obstacles to what I\\u2019m really trying to do.\"],[\"\\u201cCOVID Dream\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house, it might even be the house I grew up in - it looks like that, it\\u2019s a bungalow. I\\u2019m with my dad and we\\u2019re planning to go to Niagara Falls and spend the day at the amusement park. There are some other kids going, too, and I think they\\u2019re just friends of mine. I\\u2019m teenage me. I\\u2019m talking with my dad about what rides we\\u2019re going to go on. We discuss the fact that it\\u2019s cold and we\\u2019re going to need to wear extra clothes. So there are some conversations about what we\\u2019re going to bring because we don\\u2019t want to carry too much but we want the right things for the weather. I\\u2019m excited about going. My ex-best friend who I was still friends with when I was a teenager, calls on the phone and I tell her that we\\u2019re going. She says she\\u2019s going to meet us there because she\\u2019ll be in the area. She asks me what time we\\u2019ll arrive. I tell her we haven\\u2019t finished figuring that out yet and I\\u2019ll call her back when my dad lets me know. I hang up the phone and it suddenly dawns on me that the reason the amusement park is still open right now and not crowded is one of the reasons we decided to go. It\\u2019s not normally open this time of the year when it\\u2019s cold and near Christmas. We also wouldn\\u2019t go to an amusement park because it\\u2019s so crowded and the lineups are too long. I realize that these criteria are in existence because of COVID. It sinks in that we also should not be going. We can't bring all these people together, we can\\u2019t circulate through the park. I feel this moment of rebelliousness where I want to go anyway at the same time I know we can\\u2019t and we won\\u2019t. I voice this to my dad. He doesn\\u2019t say anything. He silently realizes the truth of this, too. I pick up the phone and call my friend back and tell her we won\\u2019t be going after all. She asks me what I\\u2019m going to do. I tell her I\\u2019m going to be home but we realized that the reason the amusement park is open later in the year and there\\u2019s hardly anyone there is because of COVID so we can\\u2019t go.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Grandmother\\u2019s Shoes\\u201d I\\u2019m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I\\u2019m at the dining room table. There\\u2019s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It\\u2019s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I\\u2019m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s her or someone else. Maybe it\\u2019s her with someone else\\u2019s face but she\\u2019s not alive anymore. Here she is and she\\u2019s acting like Nancy but she doesn\\u2019t look like her. We\\u2019re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they\\u2019ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad\\u2019s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, \\u201cNo, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.\\u201d I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she\\u2019s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they\\u2019re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, \\u201cThese don\\u2019t look very comfortable!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYou might be surprised. Try them on anyway.\\u201d So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It\\u2019s too small and it\\u2019s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d I put it back in the crate. She says, \\u201cTry another pair.\\u201d I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they\\u2019re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they\\u2019re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there\\u2019s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren\\u2019t completely flat, they\\u2019re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it\\u2019s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, \\u201cGrandma, I\\u2019m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.\\u201d They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re a seven anymore. I believe I\\u2019m now an eight. But isn\\u2019t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say anything, but she says, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can\\u2019t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, \\u201cWait here one moment.\\u201d She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, \\u201cTry these ones on.\\u201d She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they\\u2019re flat and they don\\u2019t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they\\u2019re comfortable. She says, \\u201cYou can have them.\\u201d She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, \\u201cAre you guys ready to go yet?\\u201d They\\u2019re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re wearing Grandma\\u2019s shoes.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cYes, she gave them to me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.\"],[\"\\u201cNo-ga\\u201d (instead of \\u201cyoga\\u201d) The dream starts and I\\u2019m in a room with a cork floor and boxes piled up along the sides of the walls. It\\u2019s a weird shape, not a square, not a rectangle. It has three sides as though it\\u2019s trying to make itself into a square because it\\u2019s really big but they aren\\u2019t even a triangle. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat is this room? What am I doing here?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to formulate a context in my mind for what the room is. I close my eyes for a moment then I open them again. Now the room is a square and it\\u2019s arranged itself. There are panels. The boxes are gone but the cork floor is there. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cAm I in a hot yoga room?\\u201d There\\u2019s still one wall that\\u2019s open but there\\u2019s a hallway that leads out to it. Then a woman comes in. she\\u2019s wearing a fake wool sweater, one of those thready ones, and baggy corduroy pants and hard-soled shoes that lace up. I notice that she has really unproportionately small feet for the size of her body. Her hair is kind of dirty. She tells people to roll their mats out and get in rows. I am in a hot yoga room. I see that there are about twenty people, all dressed for hot yoga class. Suddenly I have a mat and it\\u2019s rolled out and I\\u2019m sitting on my mat. She walks across the floor and now it\\u2019s that spongy gym kind of floor. I notice she still hasn\\u2019t taken her shoes off and this kind of bugs me. However, I sit on my mat. She tells us to put our feet in front of us, bend our knees and roll back a little bit then forward a little bit, so you\\u2019re just rolling back and forth on your tailbone. I think, \\u201cTailbone? Why aren\\u2019t we rolling all the way back so it goes through our spine? Maybe she has some kind of plan.\\u201d So I do it. Then she starts talking about something way off topic. A minute goes by and people are still doing this. She starts fussing with something in the corner of the room. Now another whole minute has gone by. I\\u2019ve stopped rolling on my tailbone because I think I\\u2019m going to get uncomfortable, but some people are still doing it. Then she starts talking about food. By this time I\\u2019m off of my pelvis and I\\u2019ve come onto my knees and I\\u2019m sitting there in a hero\\u2019s pose waiting for her to tell us what she wants us to do next. She starts lecturing about something, I don\\u2019t know what. I just realized that in the dream I thought it was a man that was leading the class but it\\u2019s not till the lecture starts that I realize it\\u2019s not a man, it\\u2019s a woman and it\\u2019s not because the appearance of him, it\\u2019s because I get a glimpse of the name tag pinned on her thready sweater that says, Stephanie. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh. Ew.\\u201d Then, she pulls something out of her pocket, takes a bite out of it, wraps it back up and puts it back in her pocket. She\\u2019s talking with her mouth full and it\\u2019s gross. I\\u2019m really disgusted by this person. Now about fifteen minutes have gone by and she still has everybody in this rolling back and forth on the tailbone thing. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOkay, shoes on, baggy corduroy pants, thready sweater, name tag, this isn\\u2019t even a yoga instructor!\\u201d They\\u2019ve pulled her off the desk from somewhere and told her to go in and teach a yoga class and she\\u2019s stalling. I lean over to the person beside me on the left and we make eye contact and I say out loud, \\u201cShe\\u2019s just stalling for time.\\u201d Then the person on my right has moved their mat, which isn't a mat, but a flannel sheet that they\\u2019ve folded up into a mat shape, close to me so it\\u2019s one inch from mine yet there\\u2019s two feet of space between them and the mat next to them. I lean over and look down the row. The woman has got something going on at that side of the room so people shuffled to make room for it. But I know she\\u2019s not actually doing something, but staging to stall for more time. I tell the person beside me, \\u201cCan you please move about six inches that way because you\\u2019re in my space?\\u201d They do. They pick it up and move that way. Now I\\u2019m bored so I lie down on my stomach and put my head on my hands and think I\\u2019ll just close my eyes and rest until the hour is over. Then she tells people to get up onto their knees and put their hands together \\u201cas though you\\u2019re doing your prayers.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the point of this? We\\u2019re going to be on our knees for like fifteen minutes.\\u201d I don\\u2019t do it. About five minutes go by. Now she\\u2019s at the back of the room and she\\u2019s doing something else. Suddenly there's a garbage can and she has things spread out all over from the garbage can. There are some people on their knees but most people aren\\u2019t doing it. Then there are two people with someone in between them and they\\u2019re supporting the person with their arms on either side and the person is limping. They\\u2019re carrying them out of the room. I think, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I say to the person in front of me, \\u201cHow could you possibly hurt yourself in a class where nothing has happened?\\u201d The three people leave and I think that maybe they just staged this in order to escape this horrible yoga class. I realize I\\u2019ve said this out loud and the people immediately around me are laughing. The woman comes up that\\u2019s teaching but not teaching and she\\u2019s asking what\\u2019s so funny but no one will tell her. All of a sudden, a portal opens up and I\\u2019m in a different room. There\\u2019s someone with a camera and it\\u2019s me but I\\u2019m also watching. There\\u2019s this beautiful woman and she\\u2019s turning in a circle and moving her arms so that they look like they\\u2019re actually moving faster than they are. The way the light hits her body, at the moment the picture is taken, it looks misty and the light is hitting itself and refracting off the mist. It\\u2019s an absolutely gorgeous shot. I want to recreate this so that I can take a picture and have a picture. The person that has taken the picture, I turn to them and say, \\u201cIf I give you my camera, will you take the picture at exactly the moment I tell you to?\\u201d The person agrees. I walk forward into the alcove and stand there. I start turning around in a circle, lifting one arm up, moving the other one to the side, and then when I get to the 180 point I switch arms and turn my body and switch arms. So I\\u2019m turning and I\\u2019ve turned enough times that I start to see that light, it\\u2019s circling around and coming back and I know when it hits my arms it\\u2019s going to expose the mist that\\u2019s already in the room. I say, \\u201cOkay, take it now!\\u201d They do. I leave the alcove and come back and look and there it is, it\\u2019s caught the light on the water droplets. I thank them. Then I\\u2019m back in that horrid yoga room again. It\\u2019s almost over. People are lying face down or are they just lying like that because that\\u2019s how I was lying when I left? Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cDinosaurs\\u201d I\\u2019m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We\\u2019re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she\\u2019s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she\\u2019s telling me these things, she\\u2019s asking me what I think. I\\u2019m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I\\u2019m doing is I\\u2019m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we\\u2019ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, \\u201cMy coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.\\u201d She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I\\u2019ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it\\u2019s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it\\u2019s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it\\u2019s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They\\u2019re wrestling with each other but they\\u2019ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They\\u2019re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I\\u2019m stunned. I\\u2019m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it\\u2019s winter and it\\u2019s freezing. Now I don\\u2019t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they\\u2019re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don\\u2019t seem to see where I\\u2019ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I\\u2019ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they\\u2019re looking around but their bodies aren\\u2019t moving, They haven\\u2019t located where I am yet. They\\u2019ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I\\u2019m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can\\u2019t leave them in there! There\\u2019s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they\\u2019ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they\\u2019re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can\\u2019t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn\\u2019t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he\\u2019ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I\\u2019m up to now and they\\u2019re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to shred the door. I don\\u2019t have any boots and it\\u2019s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don\\u2019t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I\\u2019m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I tell her what happened. She\\u2019s strangely puzzled and doesn\\u2019t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Coffee Pot\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It\\u2019s snowing out. There\\u2019s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it\\u2019s still snowing. There\\u2019s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there\\u2019s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don\\u2019t. The house is brick. It\\u2019s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it\\u2019s taller than it is wide. It\\u2019s old. I can tell it\\u2019s old because the glass isn\\u2019t flattened by a machine, it\\u2019s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I\\u2019m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It\\u2019s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say \\u2018it likes\\u201d because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It\\u2019s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it\\u2019s mostly black. It looks like it\\u2019s made of cast iron but it\\u2019s not because it\\u2019s light when you pick it up. I think it\\u2019s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It\\u2019s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There\\u2019s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It\\u2019s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I\\u2019ll sometimes look for it. I\\u2019ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it\\u2019s going to disappear and come back again. This day it\\u2019s missing. I have a roommate. She\\u2019s more like a neighbor but she\\u2019s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I\\u2019m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I\\u2019ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I\\u2019m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, \\u201cHave you seen the coffee pot?\\u201d She continues to look at me but doesn\\u2019t nod her head yes or no. I say, \\u201cJust in case you\\u2019re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you\\u2019re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?\\u201d She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I\\u2019m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It\\u2019s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it\\u2019s happy. When it\\u2019s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it\\u2019s been. It\\u2019s like every time it comes back it\\u2019s a little bit different. Sometimes it\\u2019s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It\\u2019s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it\\u2019s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.\"],[\"\\u201cDecorating\\u201d I\\u2019m back in the house at W Square. My brother and my niece have come to visit. They\\u2019ve brought some things with them. Everything they bring has to hang from the ceiling. There\\u2019s a swing and a light fixture. My brother has brought so many things for the kitchen that he has built another cabinet that goes where the stove used to be. Now I don\\u2019t seem to have a stove anymore because there are cupboards there now. My niece\\u2019s dishes are in there and there are internal racks so the plates stack on their ends. I look to see what\\u2019s in there and the plates are plastic and made of ivy so they don\\u2019t hold anything. I question why these are so important that they need their own space. My niece replies that she likes how they look. I would rather have had my stove. I\\u2019m saying this out loud and asking my brother his plan for the stove and where he\\u2019s going to put that. He\\u2019s busy putting the new light fixture up on the ceiling. It\\u2019s about four feet long by one foot wide. There are three wire cages that have round discs on them. The last one is a really long dunce hat shaped cone and it\\u2019s just a bare bulb. It\\u2019s really, really bright. He\\u2019s installing it and he\\u2019s busy with his tools. I go out into the hallway. I\\u2019m putting up the swing in the living room archway. I\\u2019ve got a hook for it. I insert the hook into the stucco of the ceiling and I\\u2019m turning it around and around and around until I feel it grab. There\\u2019s not much hook left and I\\u2019m skeptical that it\\u2019s going to be able to hold any weight once the swing hangs from it. I hang the swing from it anyway with the intention to ask my brother once he\\u2019s done with the kitchen to come take a look and see if he concurs with my conclusion. While that time is passing, I\\u2019ve got two great big vases that they\\u2019ve brought and some flowers. I put one on the table that\\u2019s just inside the hall and another on a long skinny table in the hallway just before the living room. I arrange the flowers in it. I\\u2019m standing back and admiring; I like how these flowers look in the two vases. They make a nice diagonal line of flowers when you open the front door. In fact, they arrange in perspective, one behind the other so it looks like there\\u2019s one giant bouquet of flowers. I think this perspective is interesting. While I\\u2019m kind of lost in that perspective, my niece sits on the swing and is swinging on it. I notice that the hook is separating from the ceiling just as I suspected. I say, \\u201cStop swinging!\\u201d and I grab the swing because I know one more swing would have taken the whole thing right out and some of the ceiling would have come out with it. I\\u2019ve caught it in time and she gets out of the swing. I take it off the hook and get some glue and some of the material that the ceiling is made out of and I put the glue around the hook. I\\u2019m sticking the material with the hook to the stucco ceiling and am repairing the hole. I have this idea as I\\u2019m screwing it back in that now it\\u2019s a permanent fixture and I didn\\u2019t know that they were going to stay forever and now I\\u2019ve made this swing forever. It\\u2019s done now. I go back into the kitchen and we\\u2019re setting up for somegames. My brother has made this big chart and they\\u2019ve gone out to get food. I\\u2019m in the kitchen by myself and looking at what he\\u2019s done and figuring out what everything is for. I still wonder at the practicality of taking up so much space for these plastic plate ivy underlays. I notice that I\\u2019m squinting because the light from the ceiling without a shade over that long cone shaped bulb is so bright. My niece comes in and says, \\u201cOh look, this is supposed to go over the light.\\u201d It\\u2019s this beautiful cone shaped Tiffany lampshade. I put it over the light bulb. It not only makes the light comfortable, but it\\u2019s really pretty. I notice as I screw it over the light that you push it in so it accordion-pleats over itself, so now it\\u2019s no longer this long dunce cap shaped thing, it\\u2019s flush with the other two round plates on the ceiling. I\\u2019m relieved about this. My brother has returned with some games. He\\u2019s got a piece of bristle board that he\\u2019s going to use as a chart to keep track of the scores. He says, \\u201cLook what I\\u2019ve done. I\\u2019ve put your son right across from you on the chart and your daughter on the Y-axis and your daughter across from you on the X-axis. Here\\u2019s the point where you are and I\\u2019ve made it just a heart.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Firefighter\\u201d I have a new puppy. I\\u2019ve put him on a towel beside my bed. I\\u2019ve just set my teacup down on my bedside table and I\\u2019m debating whether or not to take him out one more time before I go to sleep. He\\u2019s not housebroken yet. I know I\\u2019ve just taken him out so I think I have a couple of hours to sleep and I\\u2019m really tired. I close my eyes and go to sleep. I wake up abruptly, something startled me, a noise. In that startle, my arm shoots out and knocks the teacup off the bedside table. It falls to the floor and smashes. I pick the pulley up from the towel and wiggle my feet into my shoes. I walk out of the bedroom, up about five stairs and outside. It\\u2019s still the middle of the night, though. I set the puppy down in the grass. He snuffles around a little bit and I hear him peeing. We walk a little farther so he can poop. I think that he does so we go back in the house after spending a little time outside. I put him back on the towel, take my shoes off and get into bed. Then I look down and there\\u2019s poop on the towel. I think, \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t stay out long enough, I thought he pooped.\\u2019 I get another small piece of towel and pick the poops up. I walk across the hall and flush them down the toilet. I pick up the two towels and am looking around for something to put them in. I notice I have a dog crate in the corner but it doesn\\u2019t have a tray in the bottom. I wonder if you can buy those separately. I\\u2019m trying to find another towel, a clean towel for the puppy to lie on. Then some people that I know from yoga start to file into the room. The room turns into a gym. I still have the puppy. People are wanting a yoga class now. They see the puppy and start talking about him instead. They ask me what kind he is and such questions. There\\u2019s a commotion at the side of the room and I see two firefighters. They\\u2019re both dressed in the fireproof coveralls and one of them has an axe. I wonder if there\\u2019s a fire going on and if we should be vacating the room. I pick up the puppy again, put him under my arm, and approach the two firefighters. One of them looks familiar and I feel like I know him from somewhere. They say there is a gas leak. The one that I think I know says I should come with him while he shows me the sight of the leak. We climb up a ladder, the kind you\\u2019d see in a submarine that goes straight up. There\\u2019s a small opening that also goes straight up. I give the puppy to my friend and climb up the ladder following the firefighter. When we get to the top, it\\u2019s like the landing on the upstairs part of my house. There\\u2019s a big wheel, like the kind in a submarine that you turn. It\\u2019s like a waterproof lock over doorways. He sits down beside it and says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s where the leak is; it\\u2019s down there.\\u201d He indicates the other firefighter and says, \\u201cHe went down to shut it off earlier but he left something down there and it could still be open, so he needs to go back down and turn it off.\\u201d He turns the big wheel, takes the hatch lid off so it\\u2019s open, and the other firefighter slowly descends down the stairs. We know it\\u2019s going to take a while. For some reason I think it\\u2019s about half an hour. The guy I know is now sitting and anxious and he keeps taking his hand to the side of his neck. We need to sit here and wait because we have to open the hatch back up. There\\u2019s also the possibility that it might explode. It is quite nerve racking. I ask the guy I know if he wants me to do a little thai massage on his neck. He says, \\u201cOh yes, that would be great. Just a minute.\\u201d I can\\u2019t remember if he says he needs to wash his face or wash his face and hands. I wait. I go in the bathroom and also wash my face and hands. I wonder if I should brush my teeth but I don\\u2019t. He comes back down. He takes a lot longer than I think. It feels like it\\u2019s maybe twenty minutes and I\\u2019m thinking we don\\u2019t have much time left before we have to open the hatch up again. He does come back up though and sits down. I do the neck sequence and the back of the shoulder sequence - just the seated sequence - and then the time is up. I sit across from him again at the hatch. He looks at me. I guess it\\u2019s the thai massage afterglow and he says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen you like this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s gazing at me with this look that is open and maybe unconditional love.\"],[\"\\u201cA. Street\\u201d I\\u2019m back on A. Street, which is a street I bought a house on with Omar and a couple of other friends. We bought it to flip. We took everything out of the house when we bought it, including the drywall, the plumbing, and the electricity. We created three apartments from it. I lived in one on the main floor for a little while until the basement was fixed up into an apartment, and then I moved out. I kind of supervised the building, collected the rents and did day-to-day jobs that a landlady would do. In this dream, I\\u2019ve returned after being absent for a long period of time. It\\u2019s because I want to sell the house and I want to move myself. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m living far away from there like I do in waking life. In waking life I want to move and I\\u2019m trying to get the money I need to do this. I\\u2019ve got a couple houses picked out that I want to move to. They\\u2019re across the street from the Fairground. I just don\\u2019t know how much they are. I\\u2019ve contacted one of my friends who is a real estate agent to help me with this. She meets me at the house on A. Street. We enter. We start looking around. She\\u2019s doing it with her real estate agent\\u2019s eye. I\\u2019ve got a clipboard with paper and am going to write down the things she says to do to stage the house and what she arrives at as an estimated value. As we\\u2019re doing this, the tenant comes down from the upper floor apartment. She talks to us for a little while about mundane things. Then she says that she would like to move into the main floor apartment when the house sells. I tell her, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s a good idea except that you are on student welfare and they pay rent directly to us. This apartment is much more expensive than the smaller apartment that you have on the upper floor. How can you afford to pay for this? Are you working now?\\u201d She says she\\u2019s not working but she thinks she can budget so that her student welfare still covers the more expensive rent. I tell her that I don\\u2019t think this is realistic and I do some math with her. I say, \\u201cThis is how much your rent is, here\\u2019s your utilities. You won\\u2019t have anything leftover for food after that.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI can make it work.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry but this isn\\u2019t realistic. I can\\u2019t sign off on this.\\u201d She walks away disappointed. The tenant that lives on the middle floor is not present, but I have a key to go through his apartment. In the dream, I\\u2019m thinking that he\\u2019s away. But at the same time my conscious mind acknowledges that he has passed on. His apartment has been vacant for some time. We go through it and note that it needs some paint and some cleaning. We go back down to my apartment. My cats, who I have brought with me, one has gotten out to the backyard. I\\u2019m wondering who left the back door open. I go into the backyard to pick it up and notice that the other one has got out. I don\\u2019t understand this because I brought them in a carrying cage which I set down in the kitchen while we did this walkabout with the real estate. It feels like things are starting to get out of hand already. I\\u2019m in the backyard and notice that there is a tenant in the basement and there wasn\\u2019t one there when I left. I can hear some loud music coming from it. I wonder how we\\u2019re going to get in. Now I\\u2019ve got both cats under my arms and go back up the back porch stairs. I put them back in the carrying cage and firmly latch the door. I tell my friend that there is a tenant in the basement and I\\u2019m not sure if we can look in that apartment. She\\u2019s already on it. She\\u2019s pushing the door to the apartment open and I tell her, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that. That\\u2019s the door to the apartment. You have to knock first.\\u201d She thought it was just a walkway. So she pulls the door closed again and knocks. This guy comes to the door. He\\u2019s wearing jeans and no shirt and he smells like beer. I feel a little bit nervous, but she\\u2019s quite confident and asks if she can look around. I don\\u2019t go in but she does. I hope she\\u2019s okay. She comes back out and makes a few more notes then goes back up to the kitchen. We sit down on the couch and she starts going through the things that need to be done. The whole thing needs to be painted and it all needs to be cleaned. She has a few extra things like door latches and some fixtures. She says, \\u201cAll in all, you should be able to get this ready for about $2,000.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t have it, but I can put it on credit. That\\u2019s not too much to come out of the equity.\\u201d Then she says, \\u201cBut I have something else here we\\u2019re going to have to put on the windowsill when we have the open house.\\u201d I look at it and think, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d It says, \\u201cWrit of Sale.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a lien. The mortgage was not paid on the property. So the bank owns it.\\u201d I wonder how this could possibly have happened? I paid all the rents religiously every month they went in the account. Who has used this house as collateral for something and never paid it? I wonder if one of the other two partners has done something surreptitious. At that point I see Omar and he\\u2019s walking by the front of the house. I go out the door and am trying to talk to him but it\\u2019s like he isn\\u2019t really aware of me or the house, he\\u2019s just walking by. I can\\u2019t talk to him or get to him. Now I\\u2019m really disappointed and can feel that in my heart. I\\u2019m not going to be able to get the funds together to move. I don\\u2019t want to sell the house and disturb any of the process that was already in place before I start to try and sell it. The tenants have been paying the rent. Whichever one of the partners who have set this up to repay the debt, I need to leave that in place, or else I\\u2019ll end up being financially responsible for something I didn\\u2019t do. I ask her, \\u201cHow do I reverse this? How do I stop this process that I\\u2019ve put in place?\\u201d Now she\\u2019s talking to her boyfriend who\\u2019s sitting on the couch and they\\u2019re talking about a concert that they\\u2019re going to. They\\u2019re going to see Teenage Head at an outdoor amphitheatre just on the edge of the reserve. I think, \\u201cOh, I didn't realize Teenage Head was still alive or that they had done more than one album.\\u201d The boyfriend says, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re right, they only ever did one.\\u201d I respond, \\u201cSo, they\\u2019re just going to play all of those songs?\\u201d I wonder why people would go see a band that hasn\\u2019t been around for so long. I think maybe they have a strong local following and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cMain Duck\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It\\u2019s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There\\u2019s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There\\u2019s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there\\u2019s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That\\u2019s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend\\u2019s son who I\\u2019ve sailed with before. We\\u2019re having something to eat. I\\u2019m not very hungry. I\\u2019ve brought a few things to eat that I just don\\u2019t feel like eating right now, so I\\u2019m just waiting. People are deciding what we\\u2019re going to do for the day. We\\u2019ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It\\u2019s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There\\u2019s a town and we\\u2019ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I\\u2019ll just eat there when I\\u2019m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They\\u2019ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can\\u2019t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I\\u2019m hoping there\\u2019s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There\\u2019s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it\\u2019s really messy. I\\u2019m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There\\u2019s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, \\u201cWow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she\\u2019s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we\\u2019re just staying for three days. That\\u2019s okay because there\\u2019s not a lot to do here and I\\u2019d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don\\u2019t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We\\u2019re back in the reception room. The owner\\u2019s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he\\u2019s going to leave right now because it\\u2019s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he\\u2019s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend\\u2019s boyfriend tells me that we\\u2019re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that the opposite direction?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the direction we\\u2019ve been going.\\u201d I say, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I indicate where we\\u2019ve left from and where we\\u2019ve tied up and I say, \\u201cThis is south.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo here, I\\u2019ll show you on a map.\\u201d He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship\\u2019s made and we\\u2019ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We\\u2019ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn\\u2019t make any sense to me.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Race\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house with a couple of rooms. The rooms are spacious. There\\u2019s a dining room with some kind of chandelier in the middle of it. There\\u2019s a foyer between the dining room and living room. The foyer has a door that goes to the outside. The living room is also spacious with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The foyer that joins these two rooms is quite large with some furniture in it as well. I\\u2019m with another woman and two men. The other woman and the man have a relationship together. At the beginning of the dream I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re off in the shadows. I have a new relationship with the man that I can see. He\\u2019s white and has dark brown hair. I can see his features, they\\u2019re a little angular and pointy. He\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am and slim. We\\u2019re just getting to know each other. We talk somewhat. I have a feeling I\\u2019ve been set up with him but I don\\u2019t feel any energy with him and he\\u2019s a stranger. We do start talking. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing together really, but we move around the rooms and talk in different areas. I can feel myself starting to warm toward him. He can be interesting. I am starting to like him. The woman and the other man come out of the shadowy part of the dream. The man starts to talk to the man I was with. The woman approaches me and asks if we want to leave to go out for the day. We\\u2019ve both separately agreed that we do. The vehicles are motorcycles. The man I\\u2019m supposed to ride with seems to be recovering from some kind of injury and his buddy is asking him about the injury. He tells him that he thinks it\\u2019s going to be okay. Now I look and see him flexing and extending his leg at the knee. He says, \\u201cSee look, everything seems to be fine.\\u201d So, we put chaps over our legs and put on heavier coats. We go outside, get on the motorcycles and tour around for a little bit, then come back. We come back in. I'm involved in some meal preparation, as is the other woman. The two men are also doing things to help prepare. Then we have a meal on the table. We share the meal, all four of us. The other two recede into the shadowy part of the dream and leave me with the man I was speaking with and riding with all day. Now I can feel the pulse of a growing sexual energy between us. We explore this for a bit. We\\u2019re in the foyer when we\\u2019re doing this. The other man interrupts us and tells my partner that he needs to come out and look out the living room window and see what\\u2019s going on. My partner and I separate. The two men go into the living room. I\\u2019m tidying up and getting dressed. I see that there are a number of vehicles on the other side of the street, different models of Jeep from the more rugged safari type to the SUV type. Each one has a driver that has gotten out and they\\u2019re kind of congregating on the shoulder of the road. I can see also that some of them have been injured. The men are clapping each other on the back warmly like, \\u201cYou did it!\\u201d Others are rotating one shoulder up and back and bending elbows as though the shoulder and elbow have been injured but are now starting to heal. I notice that it\\u2019s a sunny day now whereas previously very little light was coming in the windows and it was semi-dark. This living room is very bright now. We\\u2019ve got a great big long console tv like the kind people would have in the 1960s that sits in a big wooden box. They\\u2019re starting to gather around to watch a big race. Some of the men that are coming in are quite elderly; whereas the man I was sharing energy with is in his forties. It\\u2019s a variety of males. They\\u2019re finding seats in this giant living room on the couches lining the walls. They\\u2019re setting up to watch this race together and it seems to be a really big event. I\\u2019m not interested in it, but I am interested in what\\u2019s going on in the backyard. I walk out. The living room exits into a greenhouse, like a sunroom, which then exits out into the backyard. I realize I\\u2019m in my grandparents\\u2019 house on the north shore and I have been all along. I\\u2019m looking for the rose bushes. All the gardens are only at the beginning with shoots, like the beginning of spring after a long winter. I\\u2019m just going from garden to garden to see what\\u2019s coming up. I go back into the house. I see the woman\\u2019s features now and it\\u2019s my stepmother. I tell her that there are some things coming up in the garden. She then just recedes into the kitchen. I check on the men in the living room and they\\u2019re still watching the NASCAR races. Then I notice that someone recently has cut roses and put them in vases in the sunroom. The roses are this deep pinkish red in the middle with light green petals around the outside. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat an unusual rose,\\u201d and I wonder who cut them and from which bush. I go back outside. Now it\\u2019s like the beginning of summer and everything has bloomed. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and I look down the length of the lawn. I can see the top of the boathouse and it has grass on it. I want to go lie there because I want to feel the waves and hear them under my body and soak up the sun. I go around to the side of the house first to see if the red and green roses came from there. No rose bushes there. There\\u2019s some kind of gardening shelf, just a little bench made of painted white wicker, with a small cupboard underneath. I open it up to see if I can find gardening tools. Somebody has already opened it and there\\u2019s a pair of gardening gloves and some shears and a couple containers sitting on the top of the bench. I wonder who has been wearing them and if it\\u2019s the person who has been cutting the roses and putting them around the house. I go a little farther and see that one of the plants is a Rose of Sharon but it\\u2019s not in bud yet. Then I decide to stop looking around the other side of the house and walk down the length of the lawn to lie in the sun for a little while. Then I can hear people talking, the doors opening, and people starting to leave. I know the race is over. I stand up and walk back towards the little bench to see if the gloves and shears are still there. I\\u2019m going to try and find some roses because I want to put some in my own room. My stepmother comes out and says, \\u201cYou really like it here, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s beautiful. Can we stay for a while?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think so.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good. There\\u2019s so much space. It\\u2019s nice not to have to squish myself into a room or turn my body sideways to get into a closet or out of a door.\\u201d She agrees. I say, \\u201cEven if I had a brand new house, they only make the bedrooms nine by nine now. I really like having a big bedroom.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, we can stay for a little while.\\u201d Then she recedes again. I go back into the living room. My friend and his friend are the only ones that remain. His friend asks him to come out for another motorcycle ride. My friend asks if I\\u2019d like to come and I say, \\u201cYeah, I would.\\u201d We get our motorcycle clothing back on and get on the bikes.\\u201d We\\u2019re driving down the highway. It goes around a bend and something I\\u2019m carrying, I think it\\u2019s a roll with a change of clothes in it, flies off the bike and I can see it beside the road. We don\\u2019t stop until we come to an outdoor cafe. I can feel that my right eye has tears in it that have been running down my face, but my left eye is dry. The friend of my friend says, \\u201cI wondered if you were ever going to express any of your grief. I can\\u2019t believe you haven\\u2019t done it until now.\\u201d I tell him that I was, he just couldn\\u2019t see it. He says, \\u201cHmm,\\u201d as though he doesn\\u2019t believe me, and then says, \\u201cWe should go back to the corner and get what you lost.\\u201d I agree and let them take me there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe House on Rowan Avenue\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house on Rowan Avenue. I\\u2019m in the living room trying to arrange the furniture so that there\\u2019s a seat in front of the fireplace for someone who wants to sit there, a space so they can still talk to someone on the other side of the living room, and then I\\u2019m creating another seating arrangement so that two other people can be in the same room but not be in the same conversation as the one beside the fireplace and the small settee across from it. There are three or four of us that have all rented a room from some absentee landlord that owns this house named George. I know that there\\u2019s only three bedrooms on the middle floor, but two of the people are a couple. I\\u2019m aware that the top floor of the house is still vacant. I\\u2019m having a conversation with my friend, Alice and it\\u2019s she and her partner that share one of the bedrooms. I don\\u2019t know the other person in the other bedroom. They were there first though and saved the room at the end of the second floor for me because they knew I lived there before and would like that bedroom. I\\u2019m really appreciative of this. Alice is telling me that she wishes there was a quiet place for her to sit in the living room because sometimes she doesn\\u2019t want to be part of the conversations. This is why I\\u2019m trying to arrange the living room to make separate spaces in it. I\\u2019ve moved the couch so the back of the couch kind of delineates that there\\u2019s almost two rooms in the living room. I\\u2019ve set up another small chair with its back against the back of the couch, so it further defines a line between the end of the fireplace and this one. I\\u2019ve left enough room for someone to walk through so there is some Feng Shui flow from the conversation space, past the couch to the fireplace and then back. None of the chairs or the couches have legs, they sit directly on the floor. I have a couple of tall floor lamps that I\\u2019ve also used. They\\u2019re sitting on the edge of the flow that the Feng Shui creates, as though it\\u2019s a road. I\\u2019ve put the floor lamps around the row instead of the parameters of the room. To me it feels like I\\u2019m setting up one world then moving along that flow of air into the other world. I\\u2019ve started a fire in the fireplace now and have pulled the chair up. It\\u2019s a round chair, like a circle with an indentation in the middle that\\u2019s full of pillows. I can sit and feel the warmth of the fire on my face and hear the crackling of the wood. Then, I see other people coming in the front door. People are gathering in the kitchen so I get up and go into the kitchen to see who\\u2019s there. There are just some people making tea. I can feel the hum of contented voices chatting amiably. I leave there and instead of going back to the fireplace end of the room, I choose the other end. I\\u2019m sitting there thinking that maybe I\\u2019d like to get a book. Alice enters the room and talks to me about how she wishes she had a space that was more private. I say, \\u201cWell isn\\u2019t the top floor still unrented?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I believe it is.\\u201d I respond, \\u201cWhen I used to live here, we kept that area as a separate reading room and we fixed it up and made it understood between all of us that if you felt like talking or entertaining, that it would be done in this living room, leaving the other room just for alone space. We put all the books up there and had a light and some comfortable chairs.\\u201d Her face lights up when I tell her this and she says, \\u201cYou have no idea how much I would love that!\\u201d She gives me a big hug and says, \\u201cThank you so much for suggesting that.\\u201d Then we go upstairs as do the other two people - her partner and the mysterious person from the other bedroom. We create this space and agree to use it as such. Then we\\u2019re back downstairs. I can see the stairs going up from my seat. I see a woman with a boy of about maybe seven or eight running up the stairs, which is something else we don\\u2019t do. All of us have agreed to go up the stairs quietly because there\\u2019s no carpet and the wood creaks. But they boom up the stairs and you can hear them go up the first then the second flight. My heart sinks and I know they\\u2019re going to the top floor. I look at Alice and say, \\u201cIt appears George has rented out the top floor.\\u201d Her face just drops. I feel disappointed that the landlord has rented the space to someone with a child because none of us here want to have anything to do with children at this point in our lives. The child upsets the agreed upon social order we\\u2019ve set up with the quietness. We\\u2019ve all agreed that if we come in at 3, we\\u2019ll tippy-toe, take our shoes off and softly pad around in our socks. One of us gets up for work at 5. We\\u2019ve agreed to go down the stairs slowly and not wake up the people that work late in the night and have to sleep in the morning. We\\u2019ve also lost our reading room at the top. I think how unfair it is that he\\u2019s rented to someone with a child without talking to us first. It seems to have defied or betrayed some kind of agreement we had for the tenants who are cohabitating in this house.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Dream\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand the structure I\\u2019m in. There\\u2019s a room, but it's not really closed in. It has a ceiling but it\\u2019s almost like it doesn\\u2019t have any walls; it\\u2019s just a floor and a ceiling. It\\u2019s good wood floors. There are shelves but I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on them; they go in a vertical line, shelf after shelf, and there\\u2019s a walking space between them. At the far left corner of this room is a desk and a chair and a glass partition like the kind movie theatres have as a small ticket booth. There are no walls on this partition though - it just has the glass front where people would pass the money and tickets through. My daughter is sitting in there. She\\u2019s writing something or doing something on the desk with her hands. I can see a level below this floor. It starts around where the desk is and is about four feet lower. Again, it doesn\\u2019t have any walls and it extends back with a ceiling above it. I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s back there. There\\u2019s a guy sitting there and he\\u2019s also at a desk and he\\u2019s got a swivel chair. He\\u2019s swiveling around, getting something behind him, putting it back on the desk, maybe calculating something, typing it in, swiveling back and forth. This guy is somebody I just met. My daughter has passed something under the glass that I\\u2019m supposed to pick up. I\\u2019m on the same floor as she is. I need to get to the floor underneath and I don\\u2019t know how I get there, but I\\u2019m just suddenly there. As I go to pick it up, the guy sitting at the desk underneath the pickup window - kind of in the way- swivels his chair around and I have to lean over him to get it. I am trying to stretch my arm over him because I think I can reach it. I come within a couple inches of it but I can\\u2019t get it. Instead of swiveling back and forth in the same pattern and rhythm as he was, he deliberately stays there a little bit longer and makes body contact with me. I can feel a sexual energy between us. I\\u2019m intrigued by this but also feel that I need to finish whatever task my daughter passed onto me. I wait for him to swivel back the other way so I can grab whatever it is she passed me. It\\u2019s like a tube, it\\u2019s tiny and pen-shaped. I get it this time. It\\u2019s in my hand. I go back into the shadowy part of this lower level that\\u2019s on the same floor as he is. I\\u2019m doing something but I\\u2019m unaware of what it is. When I come back out, he\\u2019s standing up in his chair. My daughter has come out from behind her desk and they\\u2019re talking to each other. He kisses her on the mouth. She looks surprised and backs up a step. I wonder why he did that. I think they really do have a lot in common. Then the dream just ends. But there\\u2019s something else, when he kisses her on the mouth, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a golden light all the way around them both. It illuminates her surprise and it\\u2019s quite a beautiful light. I can see how golden and young and beautiful her features are. It doesn\\u2019t change the fact that she\\u2019s surprised, but it\\u2019s that the kiss left that beautiful golden light around her face and head.\"],[\"My boyfriend and I were robbed by three of my classmates.\"],[\"Playing basketball with my friends as a kid again\"],[\"speaking to a higher self - and told me 'time is meaningless'\"],[\"I was originally working as a normal officer but then I was attacked by some monsters which were from the sky suddenly. I was killed. When I awoke, I became one of them. I started killing people and eating them. But then, very unexpectedly, I turned back into a human girl again. I was standing at the middle of a highway. A girl was running forward to me on that moment because there were monsters chasing for her. I followed her and ran very fast. We finally went to a little village but till the last moment, we were still running and escaping from those horrifying creatures.\"],[\"It may sound a bit deep, yet my most memorable dream was hearing my Dad cry in our bathroom. When I approached him in my dream, he was reluctant to say why he was crying. Eventually, he spoke how it was about tally marks on his tattoos. There was something wrong with them, apparently.\"],[\"I am walking home on a street as a child to a place I used to live.  I look up at the sky and I see round circles of various sizes all with the pattern of a candy flower; swirls of red, pinks and whites.  They are spinning, some are closer than others the sense of depth is visually clear..  I know that they are going to be pulled by a magnetic gravity like force into an invisible void, like a black hole but it isn't black, it is just a force that I can feel as an energy and yet I can't see actually see it.   I look down at my hand and I am holding a type of futuristic lottery ticket that shows a sequence a numbers: 0.0, 0.1 and 0.3, 4, 6 9 and so on.  I know in my mind instantly that the spinning balls are planets and each planet represents a number and the numbers on my tickets are ones I have selected, so a winning number refers to one of these planets. I panic because I have 'bought' too many numbers that I could not afford.  I look more intensely at the numbers on the electronic ticket and D0.1 turns red.  Yes, I am a winner! is a thought in my mind.  But I need more, I have still spent too much, the D0.1 letter and number  is in a sequence of more, about 4 and half lines.  Then there is a line gap and another set, I am searching in the next set of numbers with some that also have letters for another one to turn red to indicate a win.  One more does, and my total win starts to accumulate at the bottom of the ticket - I feel uneasy even though I  know I have re-covered my loss but not by enough to get me where I want to be.  I never actually see the amount I have won, it won't appear, it is a blur.     I wake up, fall back a sleep and go into another dream.  I wanted to go straight back into that dream (I am able to do this, the most times I have woken and gone back in is 3). The feeling of fear from that dream (above) stops me returning.\"],[\"timeloop\"],[\"For some reason I cannot quite remember, I was over across the street to the neighbour's (a couple 30 years older than me - I am 51) looking for a place for my sister to rest (my sister is afflicted by a complex health condition in various forms since more than 30 years). I go up to the last floor which is like an airy small attic, walls laid with oak wood and windows through which light enters abundant, still a small space though (I have no idea if they have a place like this), and I find there a bed where my grandmother is lying smiling to me (my grandmother has been dead for 15 years and I am named after her), covered up in a light brown blanket, as if she is cold but getting more comfortable by the minute. Suddenly I become aware that I have been introduced to the room by the neighbour (the wife) who reassures me that everything is going to be all right and then vanishes. I find myself grabbing a broom and sweeping the room, the next thing I know is that my sister is also there also sweeping energetically and we smile at each other while I chat to the neighbour (the husband) who has just appeared. I remember that I am supposed to be making the room clean and comfortable for my sister and go to check the bed, and where my grandmother was is now my sister, wrapping herself in the same blanket and looking as if she is trying to settle herself. I am shocked and I then find myself immersed in cordial conversation with the neighbour (the husband) and am dimly aware their son (they only have two daughters) is somewhere around. The son strikes me as not very clever or interesting and, feeling slightly guilty for thinking this, I redouble my efforts at a vivid conversation with the neighbour (the husband) to show that I am still friendly and approachable. The neighbour (the husband) comes very near me talking about some theory which I understand and to which I agree, he comes nearer still and a fraction of a second before he does I become aware that he is going to kiss me and although I am not all right with this I do nothing to prevent it and prepare myself to kindly endure it, to my surprise it is a very satisfying kiss on the lips for which I close my eyes. When I open them, their daughter has come in the room and she reprimands me gravely, I feel very embarrassed and guilty and exposed and I worry about how my husband will be able to understand what this was all about.

The higher the score, the more representative a word to the topic is. Since the topic words are sorted by their c-TF-IDF score, the scores slowly decline with each word that is added. At some point adding words to the topic representation only marginally increases the total c-TF-IDF score and would not be beneficial for its representation.\n",

In other words, the position of the words (term rank), where the words with the highest c-TF-IDF score will have a rank of 1, will be put on the x-axis. Whereas the y-axis will be populated by the c-TF-IDF scores. The result is a visualization that shows you the decline of c-TF-IDF score when adding words to the topic representation. It allows you, using the elbow method, the select the best number of words in a topic.\n"
