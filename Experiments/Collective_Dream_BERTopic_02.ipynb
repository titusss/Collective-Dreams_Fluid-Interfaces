I'm not sure if he had, we assumed it because he put stories with the background of him and a girl. It was like the end of the quarantine because that was what his stories talked about, they said that they could finally see each other after so much.\"],[\"First Dream: We were like in a witch camp. I was a very bad and powerful witch and there was another very crazy witch who wanted to revive someone. There were small gold objects of a person in a bottle, and I had the power to control the weather, I wanted to keep that bottle and in the end I left with the bottle.\"],[\"I dreamed that we were in a weird class that was going to start and there was BAn (Harry Potter). AKe had no beard, and we sat in the same row as this next to the window. It seemed a mix between the capital UTP with the San Martin de Porres school because of the altitude of the ceiling. Apparently it was post-quarantine and when Ake and I saw each other, I asked him for a hug and he agreed, then a deluge began to fall. And he told me something like: \\\"You are combed (something like it is raining and you are all combed)\\\" and then apparently it was a camp and we had to sleep there and I asked him to give me lodging.\"],[\"I dreamed that I was at a party at the electrical congress and my mother went, and we were at the same table or at the one after RFa's and my mother would not have alcohol, so my mother and RFa began to discuss various issues and talked of many things out of place, by the way the food looked very good. So I went out and we were like in the Secondary school but from La Pe\\u00f1a, and I met the sisters PFu and PMe dressed as with the Secondary school uniform. A friend of PFu's boyfriend (in my dream ex boyfriend) went looking for her and she grumbled. In the next dream there was Ake.\"],[\"Today I dreamed that I was on a bus from La Pe\\u00f1a on the Interamericana, trying to see the answers to a midterm exam. I did it first, and then SIr and CAb would. The two of them and the whole family of SIr were on the bus, and there I lent the booklet to one of the two and told them to review the final examples. We arrived at the Agust\\u00edn P\\u00e9rez Colmenares school and there I met ChVi, I wanted to go by bus to my house and ChVi told me to wait for the red bus that was coming soon.

I realized that at home, in my room, because I was supposed to have that class that day but one of my classmates told me not to go because the teacher had taken me out of class. So I decided to go talk to the theory teacher why if I didn't pass the course, I couldn't graduate, and they told me that he was a bad teacher and that the lab teacher kicked me out because I was three times late. In my brain I thought that I had to graduate and that I had to get the theory teacher to accept another job instead of the lab grade. So I went to talk to the theory teacher and I think that now I would have to qualify many things, but he accepted me to continue giving the subject and not to put F.\"],[\"I dreamed that there was a graduation party and I had to get ready to go and the theme was Disney princesses or costumes and I was dressed as Beauty from Beauty and the Beast.

naked\\u2026.hmm, that is strange, are other people naked too?....I wonder if my swimsuit is nearby\\u2026.it does not seem like a big deal, I will get back in the water and it will be fine\\u2026.Later, I see some homeless guys on a street corner, playing rhythms with Quaker Oats big cylinder containers as drums\\u2026.I have an oats container of my own, with a handful of oats inside shaking around, and I go over and play with them, dancing and skipping around happily to the beat\\u2026.\"],[\"Some kind of little white object is created, instead of bigger dark ones, to help tell people what is going on in the crisis\\u2026.they are like little snowmen, or toy trolls?....They are fragile, can crumble easily\\u2026.But they can travel, talk, and help us know what is going

moment, and say, yes, sorry, actually we do\\u2026.She is disappointed\\u2026.I am aware of the tension between my attraction to her and my feeling that we have to do the right thing, given the crisis

below\\u2026.Another guy is with me\\u2026.I let him drop down, then I stop him with my mind, and bring him back up\\u2026.He is freaked out\\u2026.Without these powers I would be scared up here on a tiny white seat, attached to a thin white pole maybe a thousand feet in the air\\u2026.Then I am down on the beach, sitting on the sand, looking out at the water\\u2026.Can I make a water spout rise?....I test my powers\\u2026.I concentrate, and nothing seems to happen\\u2026.then I see ripples in the water\\u2026.is that a spout?....no, but they are dolphins swimming in the water close by\\u2026.that is cool, I am interested, and I get up to go take a closer look\\u2026.At some point, maybe earlier, we are in a restaurant, and the owners say they will open up the outside

Monopoly, and gets a card that takes them to both Park Place and Boardwalk, the most expensive properties on the board\\u2026.That is a good card to get at the beginning, because you can buy them

happy to see it\\u2026.then, a tough guy goes underwater, lets an alligator grab him by the hand (I am now in the guy\\u2019s perspective, and I am surprised the alligator\\u2019s bite does not hurt more, and surprised I can stay underwater so long), then gets two alligators together, pins them against a wall, and points a revolver gun at them, to kill them as nuisances and dangers to

wonder, did I write my dream in my dream journal first, before getting out of bed?....I almost forgot\\u2026.I have to back inside to my room to take care of it\\u2026.Then when I am back on the

social good\\u2026.This is harder to do\\u2026.It is hard to stop people from doing what they want\\u2026.At another point, I see Levi our cat jump around the front gate leading out into the

have an accident\\u2026.Later, I see a flock of a couple of kinds of birds rise up into the sky, flying with agitation, little black specks in the blue\\u2026.they are confused, do not know where

push snow onto a turnout by the side of the road\\u2026.As it does so, its headlights swing to face towards me\\u2026.Lights shining straight across the valley, right at me\\u2026.I step back, not wanting to be in the light, not wanting to be seen, but I can tell the guy driving it is looking at me, curious\\u2026.So I wave at him\\u2026.\"],[\"Some uncertainty after a woman, my wife?, goes to another group who is struggling and needs help\\u2026.When she comes back, does she have it?....the virus?....It seems yes\\u2026.But then the test says no\\u2026.Earlier, people are moving a woman

bite me\\u2026.I can see his huge white teeth and fangs\\u2026.Suddenly he pauses, and turns back\\u2026.Somehow we distract him, and keep him from harming anyone else\\u2026.Later, someone is being mean or disrespectful during the crisis\\u2026.Someone else says to that person, \\u201cShame!\\u201d for not taking better care during this strange situation\\u2026.for not thinking of others who need help\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a big group gathering inside someplace, lots of people around, to talk about an emergency\\u2026.What we are all going to do next?\\u2026.But some people only want to look at our past activities, not look forward to new solutions\\u2026.I have a shotgun, and I am unsure what to do with it\\u2026.Should I hide it?....It is so big and long and obvious, and not appropriate for this setting\\u2026.\"],[\"I see Levi, as he walks towards me across the patio here at the ranch\\u2026.His tail is up, he is happy, I am surprised and happy, too\\u2026.\"],[\"I am on a large airplane flying over the ocean\\u2026.then the plane slows down, and stops all of a sudden on the edge of a large couch, to the right\\u2026.The pilot decided for some reason that the plane was unsafe to go further, so we must turn around and go back\\u2026.I am scared, I am unsure if I can hold on that long\\u2026.I see the water of the ocean far below us, and I am holding onto a small white towel\\u2026Soon after, maybe right after I get on the ground, I am standing on a narrow median strip in a road, and I see a bus coming straight at me\\u2026.it is coming so fast, I have no time to react\\u2026.Will it hit me, I wonder?....No, it goes past me on my left, just missing my shoulder\\u2026.I am scared and relieved, and now wonder if another bus will come at me from the opposite

down\\u2026.She is wearing an elegant yellow dress\\u2026.She seems distressed, or at least disappointed\\u2026.But I can see, as they pass, that it is an illusion\\u2026.Her arm is still attached,

spit or backwash, sloshing around\\u2026.They do not seem to care, they are having fun, but I think it looks disgusting\\u2026.I want to ask one of my kids, is this really what you and your friends do?....Later, I am walking past a white car filled with people\\u2026.It is parked in a parking lot, and I walk around the back of it with a wide berth so I do not get hit, in case they start pulling

would change the view of the building too much\\u2026.At the end, I am on a blue bicycle, riding up the hill on a street\\u2026.Cars to my left, one car stops in front of me, so I pedal around it to the left and pass it, then move back to the right curb side of the street\\u2026.A bold move by a biker, but I wanted to keep going faster than the car\\u2026.Now I realize I am going to try riding all the way up the street\\u2026.it is a flat area now, but more steep hills to come\\u2026.I wonder, will I be strong enough to ride all the way up, without walking the bike?....Yes, I am confident I

tasty\\u2026.He tries to make me do things for him, and I say you may own everything else, but you do not own me\\u2026.At some point I pull into our driveway in Portland, and to my surprised there is another car already there, not one of ours\\u2026.\"],[\"I see a Praying Mantis, in a room, illuminated in blue-green light\\u2026.it is beautiful, a strange sight\\u2026.Later, I see a couple of

different shoes\\u2026.That is weird\\u2026.later, I am on a plane, sitting in the right aisle by the window, and a flight attendant asks me if I am ok\\u2026.Yes, I have a bag of snack food and a People magazine, I am all good\\u2026.I realize she is trying to flirt with me?....I suppose I do look good, sitting there in a black t-shirt with my dark glasses\\u2026.At some point, on a beach perhaps, I try to pick up a small snake\\u2026.It grabs around my hand aggressively\\u2026.Earlier, I am with other people, trying to help someone who is ill\\u2026.But it turns out that one of the

getting messed up, not the way we want it\\u2026.As a result, I will have to talk about it\\u2026.In the row ahead of us, I see Madonna\\u2026.She is telling us about how happy she is, her husband thinks of her as a trophy wife\\u2026.that surprises me, I think of how famous she is herself, how many times she has played in front of huge adoring crowds\\u2026.I have a big bundle of clothes and

not a safe way to go\\u2026.I say let\\u2019s go another way\\u2026.Later, I am trying to help people from the other political party, figure out how to have their events\\u2026.What their logistical

take a shit first, to provide the raw material\\u2026.Then, maybe later, I am in an apartment in a tall building in the East Bay, and I see in the distance, across the Bay in San Francisco, a giant rampaging around, causing massive destruction\\u2026.White clouds of smoke are the first sign\\u2026.It is coming towards us, I hide in fear\\u2026.Did it see me?....I think so\\u2026.A huge white

have right now\\u2026.It seems like a good idea, but I see a dirt trail going downhill is getting more use than ever, becoming a deeper rut or groove in the ground\\u2026.Hmm, I wonder if that could become a problem if it rains\\u2026.a flash flood\\u2026.\"],[\"I see a boy or young teenager, black hair and pale, get on his bike and go down a very steep embankment\\u2026.He gets to the road

his bike, and he does seem tired\\u2026.I am amazed, that was very well done\\u2026.Later, I am looking out the window of a building at the big pool of water below the waterfall at the ranch\\u2026.I see a big fish, a salmon moving upstream\\u2026.then I see several other fish\\u2026.Wow, I call to the other people in the room, who are occupied with various activities, to come over and look, this is amazing\\u2026.But they are too busy with their own things\\u2026.Now I see a huge number of fish, and it looks like the big ones are feeding on the smaller ones\\u2026.It gets more and more interesting, and yet no one will respond to my calls to come look\\u2026.I find that annoying\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping a woman make a product look more appealing\\u2026.She is on the planet

tiny action figures, animals, a white angel with big wings\\u2026.it is fine with me, but I wonder if the parents mind\\u2026.this is slowing them down\\u2026.but they are ok with it\\u2026.The mom wanders away, and the dad, a black guy, goes up into some scaffolding next to us\\u2026.To make conversation, I ask where they are from\\u2026.He says in London for the last 8 years, but all over before that\\u2026.At another point, before perhaps, I am walking quickly down a curving path, dark green trees on either side\\u2026.Suddenly it is so foggy I cannot see anything\\u2026.I keep going, I cannot slow my momentum, but I am terrified I will crash head-on into a car driving up on the other side\\u2026.I try to maintain my rightward curve with the path, even though I can see nothing through the thick gray mist\\u2026.Then, just as suddenly, I get to the bottom of the path, and I am fine, and relieved\\u2026.I look back, and the fog is gone\\u2026.It\\u2019s just a normal, small path\\u2026.At the end, I am at a parking lot, coming out of a big parking structure\\u2026.I watch people with tiny vehicles and mechanical animals try to wind around cement curbs and bumps to get into the garage\\u2026.It seems very tedious and inefficient\\u2026.I walk away from the building, and pass two black women who seem to work there as attendants\\u2026.They talk about the airport, how they changed the rules about pilot training\\u2026.Pilots now need to know how to manage wind shear effects over large forested areas\\u2026.I hear another woman ask what that is, and a worker guy

The next part of my dream I was already in the car with a bunch of young boys but I was also younger. I\\u2019m actually not sure it was me this time but I was wearing cut off jeans and hiding something in my back pocket that I didn\\u2019t want them to see so I asked if I could use a restroom and they pulled over to a gas station then I got out of the car and remember looking at a pile of rubble wondering if I should do something about it before I went inside. Next, I went in and there were these old men leering at me. I tried to avoid eye contact with them and found my way to a bathroom. Then I woke up. When I woke up I thought I smelled the distinct smell of red wine-but I have not had red wine in my room or anywhere near my apartment. [nap dream]\"],[\"I had a dream that I was with Opal, a friend from yoga teacher training, and we were going to our last teacher training gathering and we were walking there but we were late. We were walking past the soccer fields and eventually we got a Lyft, but when we arrived it was closed and we were at the wrong address. I remember checking my email and finding that they had moved to Quincy Street and it was on an island. Meanwhile there was a soccer tournament and it was all young women playing soccer. I asked them if they had any under forty soccer groups and she said, \\u201cNo, it is mostly people in their twenties and at one time somebody came they were really old - they were like thirty.\\u201d We called again to get a Lyft to the new location and it kept saying it was a mile away and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was in a connected relationship with a man. In my dream he was very kind and nurturing, with a shared sense of humor. I knew him but had just met him, like my soul knew him. Physically he was tall, African descent, a body that enveloped mine in hugs, like I just melted into him. There was nothing familiar about my current life in that dream. Everything (locations, other people, etc) were new.\"],[\"I had a dream where the man from the first dream crept into the second dream. My recent ex was in the dream and we were skiing but I didn\\u2019t have the right gear (a helmet or a coat). I felt inadequate and frightened and he laughed at me. He kept wanting me to go break into a house \\u201cfor fun\\u201d which I thought was awful. I went to go find him and the house had little kids in it who were scared. I tried to comfort and distract them. The house was very modern and futuristic and I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to work the doors to get them safely out so I hid with them. The man from the first dream was gone by the end of this (he never went to the house with me).\"],[\"The dreams I remember mostly centered around my ex boyfriend and being unfaithful during our relationship and finding out later. In my dream I was confused and hurt. In real life I don\\u2019t think this happened but would not have been surprised, either. This is a theme though that comes up in my dreams about him often over the almost five years we were together. Wonder what else that may symbolize?\"],[\"Last night I dreamt that my late husband Caleb met me for a weekend away. He was young and I was older. We had a great time at a bed and breakfast, walking around and seeing my older sister Liz. We went driving back home but when I got off the exit it was all grassy and completely vertical. He agreed to take the car up the \\u201chill\\u201d so we got into two cars and I was following him but then I lost him. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my late husband\\u2019s best friend's wife, Candace. She invited her younger teenage sister over who was wearing a yellow bikini top and tiny black shorts with a robe. There were older guys at the house leering at her and I felt like this could be very inappropriate. In real life I\\u2019ve never met her sister but doubt this would happen. I told her to maybe throw some clothes on and they called me a prude and insecure. I was angry about it when I woke up.\"],[\"The second dream was like a horror movie where I don\\u2019t know if it was related exactly to the first dream but the family brought in the body and begged me to give it life. It felt like Frankenstein. The body was a young black man. He reminded me of a patient I worked with on the unit who was very violent (he broke a nurse\\u2019s leg) and I had worked closely with him. I don\\u2019t remember much else.\"],[\"It was night. I was invited to work offsite and someone (a colleague from NYC a decade ago) came to bring me there but I wasn\\u2019t able to navigate the muddy road in my shoes. We tried to go another way but there was a large stone gate covered in green moss. I told them to go ahead without me. Then, it was dark and I was in a city (maybe San Francisco) and trying to find my way home. I found a dog and tried to return it to this house and it was a dog rescue. They asked if I wanted cats, too. I am allergic but said I would meet them. They tried to get me to take three cats and I remember feeling scared that they weren\\u2019t declawed (in real life I don\\u2019t know enough about it but my sister has a cat and thinks declawing isn\\u2019t humane). In the dream there was a dog who came with us and we left the cats. I kept thinking about my ex\\u2019s dogs because I consider them mine and wondering if they would get along. I kept doing the math that it would be three dogs total (but it would be four). This dog was about 30-40 pounds with reddish golden hair like one of the goldens, Chuck. He came home with me and my dog Pinto. In my building we are only supposed to have one dog so I was worried about being caught, but knew my dog Pinto would be happier and wouldn\\u2019t howl when I left (he\\u2019s been doing that lately) because now he would have a friend. At the end of this dream we stopped at a Mexican restaurant and I couldn\\u2019t find the door in. Then I got a seat and had to get up to find the bathroom, but then woke up.\"],[\"I was a man (not me) and part of a gang/bad group of men who were smuggling something. I was driving a car underground - deep deep underground - and every time I would come to a fork in the road I would stop to ask the leader which way to go. We stopped at an underground diner and had sweet potatoes and blueberry pie, it was run by a large African American woman and she was hiding her kids from us and she was obviously scared and wanted us to leave. The lighting was all underground with candles and low lights on the walls.\"],[\"I was a young girl (not me) at some kind of college I\\u2019ve never been to. It looked like Chicago but I\\u2019ve never been there. It was dark/night and we were going out dancing. I was with a friend but also on a date with a guy. It was like an 80s movie. We went to a bar and by the end we had sung karaoke and ripped up our dresses - suddenly I was wearing a long wedding dress and it was ripped to my knees and glitter/color all over it like a Cyndi Lauper video or something. It was free and happy and lighthearted but there was an element of danger lurking.\"],[\"Dreamt that my younger sister was in the hospital and had similar rare chronic disease I have (or they think I have).\"],[\"I had a dream I was renting a room in a house or maybe like an RV from a guy. There was at least one other roommate. We were told to be careful plugging in our devices as they drained the system. When I went to bed I looked outside the window and saw trash and book bags on the ground, then saw older dogs sleeping outside. I didn\\u2019t know how I could sleep while these dogs were outside. I made eye contact with one who just looked so so sad. Then I woke up. The whole dream was set at night.\"],[\"I was wearing a fancy red dress and working some high level job as a politician. Some type of emergency (maybe a government attack) happened when I went to the bathroom. Some man I worked with in dream but not in real life followed me to the bathroom. I changed and then I woke up.\"],[\"This dream was surreal. I dreamt that I was with my high school friends at a basketball tournament but got stuck/lost somewhere. A young Ram Dass came to be with me while I was stuck in some kind of trap. It was intimate physically but not sexual. In some way he represented all teachers, all people. He was just loving me, literally it felt like I was being filled with love. I felt warm and peaceful, content. I have never dreamt of him or any other of my teachers before. I woke up immediately feeling warm and loved.\"],[\"I was driving down this road going over the speed limit. The sign said 50, although it was in a neighborhood so I knew it was over, and I missed a stop sign. It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow\\u2019s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I\\u2019ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids. Then I went to drive around looking for a gift of plates but all of the stores were closed. I remember bashing Trump in a few conversations.\"],[\"I was me but also wasn\\u2019t me - like me but not me now? I was skating around and around and around an indoor skating rink. There was a company offsite and I kept seeing people that I knew but I don\\u2019t know in real life but had met before in dreams. We were all going around and around. They were all faces of people I knew from some job but I never knew these people in my life now. It was all wooden and lit with artificial lighting and there was music playing and it felt like it was supposed to be safe but was not really. I didn\\u2019t want to stay but I couldn\\u2019t leave.\"],[\"In this dream it was deep deep sleep and it was dark out. I dreamt I was supposed to dance in a performance with my OT colleague Susan and my friend Kate who also works as an OT . We met and danced wearing clear gloves holding hands for rehearsal. Then we were supposed to meet for the final performance and I couldn\\u2019t get there on time. I was late and annoyed. I tried to get ready but had GI distress and then tried to do makeup but my eyebrows were gone. Then these men were coming down the road and I could see them kicking up dust. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a group of people and someone who looked like my older sister and we were walking in a place that looked like NYC, it was dusk, turning dark quickly. We saw an overweight man in a wheelchair at the top of the stairs and he asked us to push him down, we said no and he said it would help him get down the ramp. We started to walk away and he started to slide away and my sister caught the wheelchair. Then I think he had a dog with him. We all went to a dark place like a bar and these blonde women at the front were jeering at us and I lifted both hands and flipped them off (not something I would do in real life). It was forceful but dark and I don't know if they could see me. Another dream was I was in a large grocery store and people were eyes down scurrying around. Last dream I was watching a video of myself as a kid. I was injured and in some kind of sled on the grass but it was daylight.\"],[\"It was dark and I was at the store trying to buy eggs. I bought two hard boiled and two loose unboiled eggs but I dropped them when I went to the counter. I apologized to the clerk but they wouldn\\u2019t look at me. I was returning to a house I was remodeling, all made of wood. It was still dark but there were lanterns. I felt lacking, apologetic, not enough.\"],[\"It was dark, I was not me, I was an African-American woman and her daughter. I was both of them. The story played twice. I was one of them each time. There is a house we went to for safety and I think it was supposed to be a grandmothers\\u2019 house. There were old school hair mirrors on the vanity table. One night we left and it seemed like it was part of a wild game preserve or Safari or something - I don\\u2019t have a reference point for. They were giving tours at night to school children, I think. We weren\\u2019t supposed to be there so we stayed alongside the underpart where they couldn\\u2019t see us in the shadows. I remember holding onto the crumbling side of dirt and rocks and looking up. You could see the stars and you could see the man, hoping he could not see you. If you got out far enough you were free but it was dangerous like a desert. It was daytime in the desert and you could see it. The first time we went, I was the mom. I tried to hide behind a tree but he saw her and we had to get on our knees. Somehow we got away. The second time we did the same story and I was the daughter and we were much more clever. I woke up with my heart pounding.\"],[\"I was helping a slightly older couple sort through and donate clothing - I think it belonged to someone the man knew. I held up sweaters that did not fit him or were very feminine. There was a whole truck of them, some of the sweaters were not tightly woven or too small. I called my sister Sarah. In the dream she was my sister but we were the same age I think (in real life she was born on my 9th birthday).\"],[\"I was at a small bar concert or something and the woman who cuts my hair was a proxy for me to buy cowboy boots and jeans. It was night.\"],[\"I was in Asia and in a crowded bustling city at night. I was with two companions but they didn\\u2019t talk to me. I had several iPhones. We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I\\u2019m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn\\u2019t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn\\u2019t have it. I was staying alone in a hotel room that was like a train compartment and then it was dark and raining. I woke up sweating.\"],[\"I was in a dimly lit yoga class in what looked like a barn or wooden room and there was a front section for people who could practice on a mat and I was in the back on a seated section where it was darker. There were people with me but it was hard to see them. It was a teacher I used to see a lot on Sundays, and it was a class I used to go to every week before I got POTs.\"],[\"This one was more emotional. I woke up with mixed emotions. In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn\\u2019t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that\\u2019s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows\"],[\"My apartment building at night was outside. Instead of how it actually is, there were floor to ceiling windows and someone was showing me the closets and how they were different and somehow this explained why I was sick. Then this man invited me into his room in the unit and he looked like my ex\\u2019s friend Franco but was not him. He was sitting on the bed with prayer flags behind him and he was trying to explain something to me but I did not want to listen. In real life I have an aversion to him, his energy always feels like coyote trickster or something to me - like always up to something, so it was weird to come up in my dream.\"],[\"I was with my dog Pinto at a dog wash and it was strange I was on his level like another dog or his point of view at times. We weren\\u2019t talking with words, just emoting feelings. We were very connected and then we were leaving and I was me again and put him in a bright yellow rain slicker and walked him out. He was prancing and happy and proud. There was a man who I think has been in other dreams, he is kind with brown eyes and he is black and I think from Africa. He reminds me of my friend\\u2019s husband but it\\u2019s not him, just similar appearance and kind energy. I know he\\u2019s been in my dreams before and we aren\\u2019t talking but there\\u2019s an emotional transmission of some kind between his spirit, mine, and my dog.\"],[\"It was dark but like old western themed muted gray outside too. Women wearing long skirts lining up to practice shooting guns. Metal sounds clinking everywhere. Buckets of shells. Dirt on the ground. Dusty targets that were also like big bowls. Big wooden containers of supplies. Waiting in line for big guns. I could feel the vibration of the kickbacks from the shots. Big guns like shotguns, little guns and the targets. The big guns had bullets that came out with rubber tips that looked really phallic. I don\\u2019t remember much else other than it felt very purposeful and we weren\\u2019t talking or joking, we were training.\"],[\"I was in a room in a house and there was a workout video playing of doing floor abs and it was like 80s leotard old school. Something I haven't seen or thought about in years. It almost looked like a contemporary art experience. Then three loud noises \\u201cboom boom boom\\u201d and I woke up. My head on fire.\"],[\"I had a dream that my little sister Susan was having an affair on her husband with someone who reminded me of my ex. I was watching it like a movie and there were red long rugs rolled up in a big ballroom and they were running away. The sky and everything was navy blue like the ocean. I had no emotion - normally things like this even when I know I\\u2019m dreaming or wake up from the dream get me riled up for a minute but I felt nothing.\"],[\"I was on the phone with Rory asking him to \\u201cshut the fuck up\\u201d because the tv was on. Not in character for me.\"],[\"Fragmented dream. I was at work in our primary group room at the hospital with a few of my coworkers and my manager walked in for a huddle. We pointed up to the ceiling and showed her how it was buckling - it\\u2019s the kind of drop ceiling that looks white with a grid pattern- it was bulging with something that looked like pillow stuffing. We all went to get a closer look and see if we could fix it. There was also a magical component to the dream. I wish I could remember more but it was something like after this happened someone painted me with a wand and I had the pastel colors again and went for a walk by myself. It was so ordinary but it was otherworldly.\"],[\"Fragments: Dog poop. Driving to England stopping to change drivers with my father in law. OT practice changing positions then they brought a woman in on a stretcher and her family was there and then went into the dark. Dream about people and psychosis - top of building and pills, green goo on the ground.\"],[\"The last dream I saw my old friend Luke in the parking lot and he asked where I\\u2019ve been and invited me to a party on a train. I got to the party and it was like boxcar apartments on the train and everyone was playing guitar. There was some kind of game or guitar competition, but it was really crowded and while it looked fun, I just wanted to get off the moving train and away from all of these people, mostly men. Something about it didn\\u2019t feel safe.\"],[\"I was with my sister and her soon to be ex husband and we went to watch a parade but we had to stay in a big van and keep changing spots. My cousins were there, actually a lot of my dad\\u2019s side of the family was there. My finger was on the ground. There were cigarette butts on the ground. My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom\\u2019s favorite (she\\u2019s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is \\u201cI\\u2019ll fly away.\\u201d Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene. We were in the ruins of something and I thought we were uptown or in BK but then I realized we were closer to 90th street. I used to live on 89th in real life. I was back on the ground somewhere picking up trash and frantically trying to clean up this backyard dirt area where there were cereal boxes and cigarettes, and shove them into black trash bags. I felt panicked.\"],[\"I was driving over the bridge - I\\u2019m pretty sure it was San Mateo bridge - and I drove over it more than once but I don\\u2019t remember why. The road was really bumpy and I think I was by myself in the car the first time, and the second time I was with somebody else. I was in a big hurry and there were a lot of people driving over the bridge. In real life I never drive over the bridge\"],[\"I was in a neighborhood of people I don\\u2019t know and they invited me to come for a dinner in a garage. There were poster signs everywhere and there was a large blonde woman and some younger blonde children. She was celebrating something and making everyone food. When I came by I introduced myself and sat down and put on a face mask. She got angry with me and said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need that here! This has ruined the summer for my granddaughters!\\u201d pointing to them. I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really ruined the lives of people who died, and she said, \\u201cName them, name your patients!\\u201d I tried to explain that I couldn\\u2019t for HIPAA and that I worked in mental health and that many people are impacted right now in many ways, but she was so angry, foaming at the mouth and said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to have a plate anymore you can leave!\\u201d\"],[\"Another dream. I was with a younger black man and woman, they were wearing protective gear but I don\\u2019t think I was really a character/actor just a witness in the dream. They were in combat. They locked the door with the kind of lock that is a circular handle that closes safes. They were exchanging fire with people across the street. It was all under control. It was measured and it felt like the future.\"],[\"Another dream was just images of flowers being unrolled from a bouquet- side by side so it looked like Rory\\u2019s late wife Amelia showing me flowers and the spacing of the flowers being unrolled and they were tulips or some kind - that colorful.\"],[\"I keep dreaming fragments - I\\u2019m drinking water or eating breakfast. Kurt Cobain was in one and we were talking about something. I think I interviewed him about causing a ruckus at city hall once. There was a family breakfast I kept eating and then realizing I was NPO (nothing by mouth) in my dream.\"],[\"I have this image for this one: it\\u2019s a black-and-white picture of a young woman wearing a long black skirt and a white blouse and she\\u2019s looking at the camera. It is an older picture, maybe 1800s but I know that it\\u2019s my older sister Liz. I don\\u2019t know how to explain this but it is for sure her, but it\\u2019s not looking like her. There\\u2019s a look in her eyes that is familiar to me. Her birthday was 6/21 but we didn\\u2019t really talk. The emotion is kind of lonely and scary.\"],[\"I had a dream we were at this house of an old old high school friend named Aidan. I don\\u2019t talk to her at all anymore, she lives in Virginia. She and her husband were inviting me over for dinner and then the doorbell rang and a very tall and handsome man arrived and hugged me but I only came to his midsection which is strange because I\\u2019m tall. The ceiling in their house was really really low, and that\\u2019s another theme I\\u2019ve noticed lately too like I\\u2019m too tall for all of the structure; and then the man that arrived was there for me. He was there to pursue me. I liked his energy but could not see his face. I didn\\u2019t feel ready for any kind of dating stuff and wish it wasn\\u2019t put on me like this. (None of this is happening in real life, so far from a thought given current medical stuff). I go downstairs and my dog Pinto is there and there is a black and white cat playing hide and seek with him. At first it is cute and then the cat starts to hold him down and he is struggling and I am screaming her off and they are all laughing like it\\u2019s not serious but it is; they told me to just let the cat play with him and I said, \\u201cNO he is not to be played with.\\u201d I was so protective and angry. And they were laughing. I\\u2019ve felt like this before.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me- I was a woman like me but she was rich and coiffed and she was purchasing a home. It was a preview of the home with everything encased in plastic so it could be wiped down, even the art on the walls. I watched her walk to a white van with a man and then I woke up.\"],[\"I\\u2019m struggling to recall everything but I have these intense memories of being with a group of people and bonding intensely because we had to and meeting in an apartment in a dark apartment somewhere. I don\\u2019t know if I was me but then we all got into this train together and someone else had to drive it. This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like \\u201coh shit\\u201d and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.\"],[\"I\\u2019m talking to someone else remembering a time with my daughter. I\\u2019m a black woman - black with very little hair and a strong body. My daughter and I ran away. I think I\\u2019ve dreamt about them before running. This dream was both flashing back to the work on something that looked like present day and then flashing to a memory reel, some of it like old pictures. The current flash was this embodied sense of hard work - we were working with a group of people on these box cars to outfit them for something; there was conflict and confusion amongst us but out in the world there was war. We had to work stealth and fast, always at night and these boxcars had to be undetected. The flash to the scenes with the daughter haunt me. I can almost hear her voice and she\\u2019s talking about going to New York City and riding around in the backs of trucks and the image is the mother and daughter in a black and white picture in the back of an old truck holding onto a mattress and the narrator is talking about letting her daughter decide where to go and zooming in on the daughter\\u2019s face smiling but it\\u2019s sad and creepy feeling like something bad happened to the daughter and it just made me want to turn my light on as I write this. It\\u2019s in black and white. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a group of older ladies on a trip and there was a scene of getting back into the back of a mini van to go home. They had to arrange themselves like squished in the van.\"],[\"In a very vivid scene, I was away somewhere but I was NOT me. I was with someone I didn\\u2019t feel safe or comfortable with. I was choosing an outfit of clothes that I\\u2019ve never seen in real life but in my dream I knew how they would feel on my body, how they would sound (and of note the sound of one of the pants was going to bother me). It was a pink or blue outfit. Pants, turtleneck (I never wear), and vest. They came and made fun of me or something and we left. I returned to the same room with the turtlenecks but I was someone else again or a different time period, but the same person. I had cowboy boots. They looked similar to mine in real life. They were sitting outside the door, and I was going to have to leave them there to go inside the wooden door and do something (maybe it was a spa) and there was a pair of small black rain boots as well. I was inside either a cabin or a temple or spa. There were signs of people but I didn\\u2019t see anyone. I was feeling an urgency to make a decision and leave.\"],[\"I was with a group of people all coupled up. We were younger and we wore plastic bags over our feet to walk downstairs. I don\\u2019t remember much more.\"],[\"River, Highway 280, dark, my dog Pinto, paddle board, watch slipping off, Pinto almost going, Rory on phone, smoke, storm coming, return tomorrow to get watch with Rory. With a group of people from work like on a field trip going to a care home and schools. All wearing masks like it\\u2019s a part of daily life. There are some of my psych patients there too and this lady giving a tour is an OT, but I can\\u2019t place her for some reason.\"],[\"I was driving in the same universe but in a car. I stopped into a small town and it was snowing. There was a movie theater and a menswear shop. I went into the shop and saw a friend of a friend who I knew from working in San Francisco a long time ago. I haven\\u2019t seen or thought of them in years. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I had a dream that I was waking up, which was actually happening. My brain was processing all the images and feelings and emotions and moods and I was categorizing them. It was like I was watching my brain work while I slept but I was still waking up. I can\\u2019t remember content; it was more just the operational bird\\u2019s eye top level view of sorting and organizing.\"],[\"This dream involved drumming and fire and dancing and it felt like there were negative vibes.\"],[\"This was so fragmented - I had a dream that I was watching myself on a phone call on a corner having a serious conversation about something and then watching a neighbor come across me who was across the street from me. They had ching length white hair. They seemed pleasant and they had a red hammock that I could use when I came to knock on their door later that was all in the bushes.\"],[\"Half or full asleep - not sure - open door, shadows almost like visions of trucks going by, marching. All grey and green.\"],[\"A white room. My ex Rory was outside the door and I was inside. I was creating art or something on the floor. I had pot that was spilling everywhere and red wine, but I didn\\u2019t want him to see it. There was another part to the dream where we were in a house and having sex with each other but by extension with other people in other rooms but it wasn\\u2019t a graphic or sexual even. It was matter of fact. I could be where I was and be experiencing what they were experiencing. I was just experiencing people. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it.\"],[\"I was me I think and I was with a group of other people I\\u2019ve never met. We were at a store of some kind, maybe a children\\u2019s store and people were not wearing masks. Something happened: one of the men was bad and he got injured. He tried to take me and run away but I ran with another woman and I didn\\u2019t quite trust her either. We were suddenly driving at night on the streets where I grew up (kinda) and all the kids were camped out in tents on the football and soccer fields at night and only some of them were wearing masks.\"],[\"Two dreams blended into one. In one part, I was in an apartment townhouse sharing with people that I barely knew or liked and there was a strange man. I didn\\u2019t even realize that he lived in the entire upstairs room with an entire upstairs living room and that there was a walk up to the attic just for a breath of fresh air on the roof. I was telling the person who showed me that it was just like this other place I had lived. I think it was supposed to be New York or San Francisco. At the house where we live, we were doing experiments and these elementary kids would come and get dropped off for therapy sessions.We were allowed to leave but yet we were in. One night I played the piano and then snuck out with someone to have a cigarette (something I haven\\u2019t had in years and years). Next, I\\u2019m still outside in the same dream smoking. I think I was supposed to be in New York or San Francisco. There are these big hills and big avenues and we were trying to find a place to sit outside and we saw the Polynesian parade going by. It was dark. There was this dog rescue in the basement of this house/townhouse. There was a girl cleaning the dogs up and trying to take care of them.\"],[\"I was in a movie or something where I was driving down the coast of some beach town in a car with my ex following. He was trying to catch up to me but I was ahead of him.\"],[\"I have no idea where this dream came from but it was attached to the end of the crystal dream where somebody was showing us their teeth and they had inserted Christmas lights and got tube lights to go on their teeth. We were saying that this wouldn\\u2019t stand the test of time but someday they would be sorry that they did this.\"],[\"I was at the water's edge and I was with a bunch of people including a little boy that was also my current dog, Pinto. He kept diving underwater and wearing his mask and I was really impressed that he could use his paws to don and doff his mask. But he kept shooting down underwater for long periods of time and it scared me and the water was kind of grayish green and murky. When he was a little boy he had brown hair and he was two or three maybe, cute and chubby.\"],[\"I was in an apartment somewhere and it was shared with another person like a roommate. My ex Rory was there and he was making fun of me but also asking me how to sit for meditation. I showed him first how to sit just on his heels. Then I shared a butterfly position, then easy sit, half lotus, and full lotus. I\\u2019ve never been able to sit in full lotus (usually easy sit or half with left leg up) but when I did, it felt wonderful. So grounding, so balanced, so energetically healing.\"],[\"I was with a group of people in a huge storage barn or something with light streaming in all sides and I knew at least 1-2 of the people. One looked like a friend's father from growing up. We were trying to find safety and things kept falling from the top of the storage and hitting people in the head. I would look up and call out to people to watch out. I saw things coming my way and was able to deflect them and people were like, \\u201cHow did you do that? That was amazing!\\u201d and I was like, \\u201cI just looked!\\u201d There were these big long boards that would break in half and hit people. Then something changed and the dad moved us against a metal looking fireplace that had an under-hang and said we would be safe there and I said \\u201cmaybe it\\u2019s an earthquake!\\u201d And some others said \\u201cwe didn\\u2019t think of that!\\u201d But there was also a danger outside.\"],[\"I was driving along the coast near Daly City but it was a dystopian wasteland. I went to view a house or apartment to buy and it was in a neighborhood set apart from the wasteland area, it was really nice: the kitchen was so big and countertops so long with a view of the ocean. The window to the ocean looked like a circle like the kind of window from a ship as if I was looking out from a cabin. When I looked closer the ocean was full of boats, all kinds of boats and big waves and there was fighting. Someone in the room said to me that was why the place was so cheap (because it has a view of the fighting). I was sad and confused. The sun was shining. The sea was so blue.\"],[\"I dreamed about another baby bird only it was smaller and it didn\\u2019t breathe. It was also blue.\"],[\"I was with someone I knew, maybe a friend or sister and we were sitting down and going to take a picture of ourselves, but no matter what I did I couldn't get the selfie thing right.\"],[\"I was with my late husband, Caleb. It felt like his energy. Grounded, safe, playful. It was dark. We were walking my dog Pinto in a stroller but making plans to see a movie and run a marathon. I lamented I wasn\\u2019t wearing correct footwear. He had to go do something and would be back. I said okay, I started to race without him, trusting and knowing we would figure it out. I said my only goal was to finish the race. He wasn\\u2019t there when I said that but somehow I heard him say, \\u201cjust being in the race is the goal.\\u201d He found me after I started the race and we stopped and went to the movies. We were so content just to sit together, just like before he died. He reached over to hug me and it was so real it woke me up. I swear it felt like he was here.\"],[\"In my dream I woke up and I was in my apartment but it was the inverse layout and the lights were on. There was nothing on the walls, except there was this strange out of place headless glass bust on top of the TV. It was so out of place. I went to get water and felt like someone was there and things started falling out of the water tray but they were words and ideas not water. Later in this dream a PT I work with called to ask how to get her driver\\u2019s license and I consulted with Rory for some reason and I was annoyed by this. She said she was running late but on her way. I kept thinking, \\u201cWhere are we going and she needs to quarantine!\\u201d\"],[\"I was at Esalen for something but there were lots of families staying there. We were kind of in pods away from others but I didn\\u2019t have a pod, it was just me and some other people who were way younger than me. At some point in the dream I got drunk on red wine, it was overflowing from a plastic margarita cup (I have no reference point for this) but I had just hooked up with a cute young guy (also totally out of character- the whole scene actually pretty ego dystonic for me). Later in that dream or a new dream, I was working on something and someone kept asking me to bring mural supplies to make a giant sign. They wanted this one kid to work on it and this annoyed me. I don\\u2019t know why maybe because someone was telling me what to do?\"],[\"I was with my sisters and my mom or a woman who represented my mom (who passed away when I was 20). We were like a group of Thelma and Louise type characters running from town to town and we were getting chased by police, there was even a water chase scene on jet skis. Then I woke up.\"],[\"Family meeting with patient A (who happens to come from money) and a poor patient C sitting in the dark. I sat with the poor patient in the dark. I was so angry with the team for giving so much time to the entitled patient.\"],[\"I was with my friend Emily and she was pouring champagne into glasses and she had some pre-poured in her cupboard! However she drank first and then gave me one but it was a large round cup. I was disappointed it wasn\\u2019t a champagne flute but didn\\u2019t say anything. She said I could stay and watch a movie if I was lonely. I explained that I tried reaching my sisters but that they were busy. In my dream I saw an image of my sister Anne and her family dressed up like fancy Santa and elves and they were doing a family photo shoot and kind of snobbish. Then I went back to my other dream.\"],[\"I was taking a car to a parking lot that was also inside of a house. There were young black valets and I think they thought I was a \\u201cKaren.\\u201d I wanted them to know I wasn\\u2019t. I got out and went inside this house and it was HUGE and super nice and somehow mine. Not a reality for me. It had wide stairs but in order to go up, I had to go down and it was frustrating. When I finally got upstairs an alarm went off so I turned around to go downstairs and had to go up before I could go down! Then I woke up. The stairs were like pool table green with big mahogany bannisters.\"],[\"I was renting a house for Christmas or beyond and I had my own decorations and furniture as well as the ones that were there. My sister Sarah arrived and was trying to help but was annoying me. She was asking if I did this or that and I just wanted to be left alone. I had a long handled lighter for a candle and couldn\\u2019t get it to work and it broke and was leaking fluid everywhere. Then I woke up annoyed.\"],[\"I was with my ex Rory, and we were traveling somewhere like doing a condo or a timeshare or something. When we got inside we were trying to close the blinds and they fell off and he was like, \\u201coh this happened when I was here before,\\u201d and I was like, \\u201coh that\\u2019s annoying.\\u201d The people who worked there were sitting outside looking through the window and not helpful at all, just rolling their eyes. He had shared that he\\u2019d been there before with his late wife and I was like, \\u201coh where are we?\\u201d and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was driving on this road and I got off thinking that I was going somewhere in relation to the water's edge, but it was like a place I\\u2019ve never been before in real life and it just took forever. I kept driving and driving and driving and it was on these windy two lane roads and I thought that I would\\u2019ve been there already. Then I was told that some people make that commute every day\"],[\"I was with one of the attendees, Dr. Donovan, again and she took me dress shopping. We were going to a place where I had gotten a wedding dress before and this was in the dream not in real life. We arrived and this lady was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have time, just try these on and you can buy them.\\u201d She started pulling dresses off the shelves and Dr. Donovan was like, \\u201cwell what size do you think she is?\\u201d and she pulled down my top to show her how much bigger I was there when I got married. The lady said, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have room to put a ball between you and another person so probably a large or an extra large, just go grab them.\\u201d So Dr. Donovan and I went to go find large and extra-large off the racks. We got the sequined short dresses - I would not wear them right now in my current body...and we are in this big huge boutique and running around to find everything. They were in all these different colors like pink and they had sparkles on them. When I looked up beyond the store there were other aisles for big box store type stuff, but it looked like we were still inside of this boutique.\"],[\"I was walking along a main street where everything was fucked up from water damage and my friend Emily had a shop that I didn\\u2019t know she had until then and it was ruined but it was like a paper shop and she needed to place these big bottles in front of the machines.\"],[\"I woke up in another dream where I was recovering at a house but the house was for sale, so I had to make it presentable. I\\u2019m trying to remember the details on this but I was also watching the interactions between a couple. There was a man and a woman who were together and he was trying to make friends with all of the single women at the party and make plans to see them and his wife was like, \\u201cdude take a break!\\u201d\"],[\"Then I had another dream where I was visiting. I think I was back home in Virginia and I needed to crash somewhere and I don\\u2019t know who the friend was but he was explaining to me that his relatives had this townhouse. They had just gotten it as a deal because the owner had died by suicide in the closet. Actually now that I\\u2019m thinking about it, it was my ex Rory and the people that live there were his mom and his stepdad, but it wasn\\u2019t them - it was definitely not them really - it was just like his mom\\u2018s voice was the lady. In any case the place was a disaster. There was food all over the floor and it was really unkempt with stains everywhere. They kept saying that the middle level of the townhouse was cold and that\\u2019s where the person had died by suicide in the closet. They kept making references to it like it was spooky and it just made me sad for the person that had been there before. It looked like the street I grew up in Virginia but it was townhouses instead of small houses. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a family like on a family vacation and we are fighting over wood beds to sleep in. I lost my shit on one of the sisters. I mean these are not people I know or am related to or who look anything like me. One of them was leaving the next day and she wanted to sleep in this bed. I lost my shit on her and it was really interesting to see the family dynamics of another family and it was me, maybe the dad, and two sisters.\"],[\"I had a dream that I was with my ex Rory somewhere but it wasn\\u2019t Rory and it was with the dogs but it wasn\\u2019t the dogs and they were kind of like stand-ins. Then I bought a chair, kind of on a whim. I think it would be a good chair for this outdoor space at the place we are renting for the week. I went inside to take a shower and it rained, and the chair got soaking wet. When I realized that Rory didn\\u2019t bring it inside I asked him why and he said, \\u201cwell you bought the chair,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cwell were you looking at the chair? I didn\\u2019t know it was going to rain,\\u201d and he just shook his head at me. I was really pissed off. Then one of the dogs, Trevor, was a lab instead of a golden retriever and he started to slip off of the deck and I went to catch him before I woke up.\"],[\"I had a huge family of people I\\u2019ve never met in real life and they were all coming to visit me somewhere. I was trying to help all the kids get to sleep and offering them different quiet activities. I think I called them quiet leisure activities, LOL.\"],[\"I had another dream where I went to go interview somebody and they were from the Native American culture. I\\u2019m in the bathroom. They had a really disorganized display of towels and things with animals and Native American sayings on them. I think some of the animals were bears. When we walked out of the bathroom somebody with all black hair and black face walked out behind her like a ghost and it really startled me. I asked about it and somebody said something about things following you around.\"],[\"I was on this moving platform of things and my dad was there. I was embarrassed by him because there were other people I knew from work, like attendings etc.\"],[\"I was a younger black teenager and I challenged my older brother to a fight and I knocked myself out into the wall. I was narrating like a movie.\"],[\"I was going to fly and we got on this rolling cart of people including this couple and the woman had these multicolored pastel bowling shoes.\"],[\"I was riding along as a passenger in an old beat up pick up truck. We stopped at this old town and got out. We walked inside this tiny little gift shop and it was like walking in circles. I couldn\\u2019t fit anywhere, it was like a doll house. There were boxes all over the floor and I kept thinking, \\u201cthis is not ADA compliant.\\u201d\"],[\"I was at work and my colleague erased my quote from the board...I wasn\\u2019t mad I was just confused\"],[\"I was moving out of a room or suite from my best friend Aidan\\u2019s house and she was helping me move. We have packed up all the boxes and are making sure we have everything. There are all these clear containers. Then I was getting dressed and she was carrying everything down faster than I could. When we walked out her mom was lounging around outside and there were all these stairs, lots and lots of stairs. I said a joke about how she was a Sherpa and it was really funny. Then Aidan and I went out somewhere and it was during the pandemic but we were in high school like we were when we were best friends and yet we were both wearing our work clothes for some reason and my badge had University Health care. It was hard to see and it said 9 to 5 and we went into this police station or Fireman's gym and they really go \\u201c95\\u201d like it was the call number for a place that they knew. I was embarrassed to tell them it was a particular university, but 925 meant something in the dream.\"],[\"I was on a plane with a team and the plane got shot down. They thought someone was coming to save us but they were shooting at us and we hit the ground running. I picked up a Pisces picture and others. A craft fair and handkerchiefs. Lying but not lying. These were the same handkerchief as the other thing I got. I didn\\u2019t realize it until I pulled it out. The colors were purple and teal and then a design. Other fragments: my first year; Marathon shoes; Makeup bathroom; Cinnamon rolls and blueberry and bordering ahead for next day; Japan shoes off; New shoes running training alternating and two other people; Turning gas off/on way down the path- neighbors and dogs jumping. It looked like my old house growing up. Cleaning out the bathtub, bad vacuums and trash bags, I think I was moving and I sprayed the cleaner on the walls and it was peach and teal and I cleaned while I showered.\"],[\"I was in a yoga studio and crammed in trying to go to class and I couldn\\u2019t see the teacher and I was annoyed at the people around me because they were acting really immature.\"],[\"This dream was probably based on the movie I saw tonight before I went to bed: something about the vast of night. The dream was about carrying a family\\u2019s history in the car on the highway. My dream looks different than the movie but the idea was similar which was I was carrying the stories in a car and I went to go drop them off somewhere for someone\\u2019s family history.\"],[\"I was at Costco or something and I went to go check out a VHS or a CD movie and because of Covid he put the helmet on me, and then he put on a VR helmet.

The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn\\u2019t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I\\u2019ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn\\u2019t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn\\u2019t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn\\u2019t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn\\u2019t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.\"],[\"I was in a tiny house with my husband that was glass (or mostly glass: had a lot of windows).

It looked like a cheap Korean spa\\u2014beautiful materials were used like jade flooring but it was damp and the floor uneven and I had vertigo. I had invited my mom and sister and niece to live with me. There was a noise in the downstairs portion of the house and it was a child that was completely deranged/a monster really. It had a gun and was shooting at us. I got a gun and I was fumbling with it, I was so scared! I dropped it and it rolled down the floor (very sloped uneven floor). I ran to it and tripped and almost had it when the monster was standing over me with the gun. I shouted \\u201cbehind you!!\\u201d And the baby turned and shot my mom! I felt so guilty it was my fault I ran to her and the baby was still shooting. I got the gun and shot it. It rolled very gruesomely all the way down the uneven floor to the door and down the stairs. It was horrific and bloody. And my mom and this random monster baby were dead and I had to do something but I knew no one would believe what happened! I had to make up a lie blaming my mom for it all. I didn\\u2019t want to do it and I forced myself awake.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room.

This is a love story, though not a waking life idea of a love story. Traveling through Asia as a college kid, following in with an anarchist gang and getting into a lot of trouble. Fleeing a penitentiary sentence I escaped to an island and found my true love. He didn\\u2019t believe in marriage or monogamy and I found space to allow his love in my life and not have it be the center of my life. I accepted his conditions. I raised our child kind of solo with him in and out for long periods of time. He ran a hostel on the beach which is where I met him. There was never a sentiment of hate or resentment. At some point I decided to leave the island with my kid and travel back to the states and settled down there for a while. When the child grew up I returned to my nomadic Ways and wandered back to the island. There were no phones or anything like that but I found my love at the hostel and we settled in together there until he died. This dream spanned from age 18 to 70. I was grateful for what I had. I didn\\u2019t control or expect anything, which is weird, because it is not how I am in waking life. I woke up missing him. I accepted a lot of limitations, particularly with my lover, and surrendered to it - having a beautiful life with and without him. I chose love over what I thought was due to me.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room. The paint on the walls was old and chipping and the carpet was raggedy.

And then there was me, a researcher. I take over research from my predecessor. No talk of who that was or where they left off or where I was to start. Joyous and also conspiratory. Conversations hushed when I\\u2019d come in. There was something everyone knew that I didn\\u2019t. No one was unwelcoming or overly welcoming but something was amiss. Something subtle. There was a small Market across the street, the only place to get food but we were a farm so it was confusing. What were we farming? I remember wondering why there wasn\\u2019t a barn and asking about it. I was in a place of questioning everything, a feeling of excitement and also of distrust. There was a knowing that my aunt's house was close and that I\\u2019d grown up seeing the farmhouse. The overall feeling of the dream was eerie, even if the actual events weren\\u2019t blatantly so.\"],[\"\\u201cChosen\\u201d Flashback to my teenage years. Teenage girl having to hide her blood was told her blood had a disorder. \\u201cKlingian or Klingon blood.\\u201d She had to be on the run. Then when One child was born, we had to run away with her in the car. No car seat just bundled in the truck in a basket. On the road just us two, stopped at a pond on a cliff-an old lover was there - Steven. He was hang-gliding and shirtless and offered me a moment of comfort. It got tested while we were gone and had to hide again. There was a hang glider on the edge of a cliff.\"],[\"People are walking around in a circle, in a kind of hohum way, just doing their business. I see one of my friends and she\\u2019s walking with a man who is her boyfriend. I see that they\\u2019re just staying together - so they\\u2019re just like, okay we\\u2019re just doing this even though we don\\u2019t really enjoy each other or what we\\u2019re doing together. Then the scene shifts and I\\u2019m walking down a road through a safari setting and there are big predatory animals like bears and lions and also giraffes and things like that. Then I know that just ahead of me in the bushes there will be a mother pig and her little piglets. Behind me I sense a big boar stalking me. But I know that in order to save myself, I have to kill the mother pig. So when I get to the mother pig (this is the third or fourth time the dream repeats itself tonight, like a loop) and I actually do it this time - I have to take her, rip her out of the bushes, away from her piglets and throw her down to the ground three times to make sure she is dead. Then I can keep going.\"],[\"This dream is remembered in fragments. It\\u2019s a little disconnected in my memory. In one part, a group of us has set up a puja to Ganesh and the puja is set up outside of the temple because that\\u2019s where we\\u2019re supposed to do this particular service or worship. However, somebody has decided instead to take down this ceremony and move it to the inside of the temple and use the altar pieces, especially the altar cloth, that are meant for worship of Nataraj. To me it feels sacrilegious. There are people that live and work in the temple that are really not happy with this disrespect. The person who\\u2019s leading it doesn\\u2019t seem to really have any awareness of culture or tradition. Then there\\u2019s a girl next to this person who\\u2019s in charge of the ceremony and she\\u2019s wearing all white. This, too, is not correct. People are looking back and forth at each other commenting on it, and then she sort of stumbles over her words. So her mother, a few people down, tells her to have everybody turn around to face outside of the circle and take their pants off because it would be easier if they did that - easier for her to remember her words. So she tells everyone to do this and they do. I am looking at this nun and she\\u2019s a Buddhist nun and she\\u2019s really delightful. She has short hair and robes. I can see her face because it\\u2019s reflected in a mirror and she\\u2019s making all these delightful expressions - looking at people around her, lifting up her eyebrows and opening up her mouth in a big happy smile, then going back into a serious face. She seems a little bit odd to me. Then suddenly the scene shifts. She\\u2019s still there, but she\\u2019s the size of a fairy or gnome and she\\u2019s standing in the grass. She\\u2019s still making these delightful expressions. There\\u2019s another small person with her. Then, somebody finds a journal and it\\u2019s my journal. The last entry is from December 31, 2019. I start to fill it in. I write the date next to it, January 1, 2020. I can\\u2019t remember exactly what happened, but I\\u2019m trying to fill in information or entries from that point on. Then another scene: there\\u2019s a little boy and he comes up to me and we\\u2019re not really connected right now. He wants to be in the bed. I don\\u2019t want him in the bed. Then I take this apple and he bashes his head onto the apple and then this apple turns into some kind of vessel with holes and slices and cutouts and what not. Pooled in the bottom of the apple is this red liquid, like blood. It\\u2019s an elixir of some sort. So I lift this apple to his lips and he drinks it. It does something to his consciousness. That\\u2019s all I remember.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, I am teaching a yoga class and I took it over from another teacher. At first the room is full of people, mat-to-mat. It is a chaotic energy. I start teaching. Then I turn away and look back. There is only a scattering of people. Most everyone has left and their mats are abandoned in a haphazard way, overlapping each other. It\\u2019s odd and doesn\\u2019t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don\\u2019t even teach savasana. As I\\u2019m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she\\u2019s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I\\u2019m amazed she hasn\\u2019t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She\\u2019s still not breathing. Then I wake up.\"],[\"I am walking on a sidewalk with my husband and see a pile of packages ready to be mailed. They\\u2019re addressed to our parents and from our friend Sherry. I think it\\u2019s such a nice gesture that she bought presents for our parents and we didn\\u2019t even think to. We see that one package is not fully wrapped. It\\u2019s a cake and waffles. We nibble the waffles and love them! We eat around the perimeter and hope it doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019ve been snacking on their gift. Then I\\u2019m with my husband and his family - dad, step-mom and step-sisters. We\\u2019re standing in a circle and they are passing around the beautiful cake that Sherry sent. They cut different sized slices and Krista takes an extra large slice - it\\u2019s so big there isn\\u2019t enough for everyone. Either I or my son grab the cake from her and start to eat. She\\u2019s upset, but the rest of the group says \\u201cno, they need cake, too.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful cake with orange frosting, different layers and textures. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in the same room, but it\\u2019s later in the day. I\\u2019m alone with my son. My husband\\u2019s dad walks in but he looks like a zombie, as if he\\u2019s been in a car accident. He\\u2019s completely bald and white pale and his face is streaming with blood. Then a younger version of my husband\\u2019s dad comes in with blood streaming down his face, too.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we\\u2019re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I\\u2019m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I\\u2019m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That\\u2019s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I\\u2019m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There\\u2019s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I\\u2019m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, \\u201cI was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.\\u201d She lists the women, but I don\\u2019t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it\\u2019s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don\\u2019t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It\\u2019s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He\\u2019s playing with the water from the fridge. He\\u2019s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I\\u2019m concerned that I don\\u2019t have anyone to take care of him and that he\\u2019s disturbing the session. But my client doesn\\u2019t seem to notice or care that he\\u2019s interfering.\"],[\"A store after hours. It\\u2019s been closed for a while now. People are gathering here at night, unlocking the door and huddling close inside. Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I\\u2019m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I\\u2019m not really welcome because I\\u2019m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won\\u2019t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I\\u2019m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving in a car with a group of people. One person is Thomas, a good friend from high school, who now is a designer in New York. We are driving past caged animals - wild animals - on both sides. We see elephants on both sides. On one side, the elephants are very calm and we comment on their parasympathetic nature and how unusual it seems in this confined space. The elephants on the other side look thin, agile and strong - there are mothers and calves. Someone who works there opens the gate to allow the animals to move from one side to the other across the road. A beautiful black gazelle leaps past us into a field. We get out of the car and follow the gazelle to see it up close. In the field, we come across two warthogs eating flowers. We\\u2019re close to them and someone remarks on how unusual it is to be this close without them charging at us. Then that seems to remind the warthogs of their nature. They lift their heads and start running after us. We run away as fast as we can. There\\u2019s a huge brown cow of elephant proportions so we have to run wide so she doesn\\u2019t kick us or knock us over with her long tail. Then I see my mom and dad riding a cow like a horse. My mom reaches down to catch my hand and pull me onto their cow. It nearly pulls her and my dad off the back of the cow. The cow is still running, but thankfully they are able to pull me up and we are able to escape. Then the scene shifts. I\\u2019m in Costco with my husband. We have an empty cart and we\\u2019re in the area where people eat pizza and hot dogs, but no one else is there. I see a sign with my husband\\u2019s full name on it. He\\u2019s been called for an appointment and now that he\\u2019s arrived and we\\u2019re done, they put the sign up higher on the wall to be reused. In another scene, I\\u2019m touring a house with my friend Kyle from high school. We\\u2019re in a big beautiful home with a lovely library filled with walls of books and reading nooks. Then I\\u2019m in a garage with a client from waking life. She\\u2019s talking with me about a few different magic shops in town that she knows about. There\\u2019s one called The Hidden Sword. She wonders how they\\u2019re doing and comments on how they invested in $2,000 in inventory to open.\"],[\"\\u201cA Seaworthy Vessel\\u201d I have built a big raft for the ocean with a group of about 5. There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there\\u2019s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It\\u2019s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I\\u2019m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I\\u2019m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don\\u2019t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They\\u2019re all great and I love them all. I\\u2019m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don\\u2019t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I\\u2019m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I\\u2019m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he\\u2019s pointing out. It\\u2019s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I\\u2019m in a shop. It is Jeremy\\u2019s shop. It\\u2019s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It\\u2019s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race. So we set a trajectory...\"],[\"I am at a Parks and Rec facility with a couple pools, workout rooms with stationary bikes and rooms upstairs for group classes. There\\u2019s a place on the farside of the pool where a man makes scones and homemade soaps and also sells produce. I get a job at the Rec Facility cleaning up. I\\u2019m at the side of the pool, pulling in the lane ropes out of the water and to the side of the pool. There are still people in the water. A man comes and is completely bald. He has a lot of vitality about him and is charming and warm. I can tell by the way he carries himself that he is a man of great wealth. He asks if he can help me and I tell him I don\\u2019t need help. I continue on with my work. He stays nearby, but is not lurking, just looking around. Then I go through the glass doors. There are bikes on display that are for sale. People have gathered to see a demonstration of a new bike. A man comes up from the crowd to help pull ropes and gears from under the ground to the stage to help demonstrate what this new bike can do. We\\u2019re all watching and waiting. This bike is expensive and the technology is quite advanced. The charming and beautiful bald man is standing next to me and after watching for a bit, he decides to buy a bike without knowing or asking the cost. I observe that he must be quite wealthy. Then, I am standing in line for my daily scone. He is with me and stands in line behind me. He is asking me about the scones, soap and produce. I tell him about how wonderful it all is. People pre-order scones, so they are guaranteed a scone each day, but there is a small selection of scones available. He steps up to the counter and orders 5 scones for both of us to share. The flavors are sophisticated, two pink ones with cardamom and peppercorn, two chocolate, and a plain one. The pink and chocolate scones are on a higher plate, and the icing drizzles down to the plain one. They look delicious. I\\u2019m looking through my credit cards, trying to find a specific one, but as I look, more cards seem to appear. I\\u2019m squinting at the cards because I can\\u2019t read them well. There are so many credit and debit cards, and I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with them. But he pays, so I put my cards away.\"],[\"I am at a teahouse - it reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco. I\\u2019m enjoying tea with a man and looking at his hands to see if he is wearing a wedding band. I have a memory of walking and talking with him and seeing a wedding ring. Now, his left ring finger is bare and his right ring finger has a silver band. Then I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walk in and am so disgusted. There is diarrhea all over the floor and big sticky gobs of shit everywhere - toilet seat and floor - and an especially disgusting yellow mucousy looking one dripping off the handicap bar. There is toilet paper strewn all over, too. I still have to pee. I end up getting shit on my hand. Then I\\u2019m trapped in this repeated portion of the dream, where I am trying to pull my pants up. I have one of my son\\u2019s diapers on and as I\\u2019m pulling the pants and diaper up, I keep smearing poop on the outside of the diaper\\u2019s right panel. It\\u2019s gross. I\\u2019m trying to repeat the scene in the dream to make the poop disappear, rather than deal with cleaning it up. I am in this bathroom with all this shit for a really long time. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m at a restaurant, sitting at a table all by myself. I\\u2019m looking out across the other tables and I see an acquaintance, Liz, and her husband. She is wearing a revealing black and red snake skin dress that displays her body and all her tattoos. She\\u2019s also wearing high red shoes. She\\u2019s flaunting her body. She\\u2019s looking back and forth at me and my husband. I see that my husband is sitting at a table near her. My husband is sitting with another person - this person is both the man I was enjoying tea with and a woman, somehow. Liz has a haughty look about her, assuming things aren\\u2019t going well with my husband because I\\u2019m sitting alone and my husband is enjoying the company of another person for dinner. Liz gets up and walks around to my husband\\u2019s table to say hello. All the while, her chin is lifted and she\\u2019s looking back and forth between my husband and me in this \\u201cknowing\\u201d way. It\\u2019s extremely uncomfortable. Her husband is also looking back and forth, more curious than haughty. The dream shifts again and I\\u2019m in a store. I have two massage tables set up near each other. I\\u2019m on probation and they\\u2019re deciding whether to imprison me or not. A man comes in - he\\u2019s the one who makes the decision. He lies down on one of the tables. Another woman who is also in charge is on the other table and the tables are actually right next to each other. We move the tables apart a bit. I massage his neck and head. He gets up to take care of some work. I tell him his scalenes and upper trapezius muscles were very tight, and I tell him what I did. Even though the work was good, they decide to imprison me. They lock me up in a room. At first I\\u2019m quiet but then after they leave, I bang on the door. The man from the tea house is there on the other side of the door. I ask him to help me, but he won\\u2019t.\"],[\"My mom is standing with her shins next to a child\\u2019s trampoline. In the middle of the trampoline is a pile of things that she is not aware of. She is looking around the room. I look down and see two snakes. At first I assume they are just plastic. They are both black, yellow and red. One is primarily yellow, the other is primarily red. Then I look more carefully and see they are alive. I stop for a moment and think this is impossible. But they are both stretching out towards my mom and one has its tongue out as if tasting the air around her leg. Then I realize they are alive and I urge my mom to stand back because these snakes are alive. She quickly moves back. Then, we realize it\\u2019s a test of some kind. One snake is poisonous and the other is not. Which one is poisonous? We are trying to remember by their markings. In another scene, I\\u2019m with Pema upstairs in my home (it shares some similarities with my current apartment, but not entirely). The banisters are overgrown with lavender, but it's growing as a vine. We are talking about family dynamics, particularly our parents\\u2019 dynamics. She tells me that her mom told her that her dad would never leave because it\\u2019s too complicated. Somehow, her saying this reassures me. Then someone comes and ties back the lavender with bungee cords to tame it and help guide its growth, so it doesn\\u2019t overcrowd the hallway. It looks more beautiful now. I\\u2019m upstairs for a while, then I notice new decorations on the wall - carved wood. I go downstairs and see it was some kind of Christmas day. My dad and my sister are sitting on the couch, and there\\u2019s a man with bright red hair sitting on the floor. They\\u2019re watching a movie on the projector screen. They have just opened presents. The guy asks my sister about the origin story of her daughter\\u2019s name. She starts to cry because it is such a poignant story. She says, \\u201cI wonder if I can just write it on paper? Then I wouldn\\u2019t cry so much.\\u201d The guy steps away to give her space. She starts to cry those soft tears of memory. We are all waiting for her to tell the story of her daughter\\u2019s name. In another scene I see two swans stepping into the water. One is grey and white, the other is mostly black with some white.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a lake cottage with my son. We are standing on the edge of the lake. We see a mama and baby swan, a rodent/marsupial mama and baby, and another mama and baby animal. He points out a small black bat struggling in the water. We are watching it as it splashes. He\\u2019s asking me about it: \\u201cIs that a bird, mama?\\u201d I tell him it\\u2019s a bat. I\\u2019m concerned it could have rabies. Other people and kids come by. They are climbing around the rocks. A woman holds my son and then gives him back to me saying he pooped in his diaper. I\\u2019m surprised because he\\u2019s potty trained. But I do see that her dress is soiled and so is his diaper. I take him away to change even though he wants to stay and play. We return to the cottage. I see Trina, a friend and former boss. She says, \\u201cOh, I need you to run an errand for me. I need you to carry my pet wombat to my other house.\\u201d I take this wombat with me on the trip and it is climbing all over me. It\\u2019s quite cuddly, cute and soft, like a baby. I arrive at her other house and see a lot of people. They are soaking in hot tubs by the lake. There isn\\u2019t a spot for me here. Then Trina\\u2019s husband wants to show me something. It\\u2019s a restaurant or storefront under construction. He wants my opinion about the flooring and decor.\"],[\"It\\u2019s a summer night. I\\u2019m doing work for Edward.. There\\u2019s a cottage with a garden. He sends me out with garden shears and a request to find five poles. I go out into the garden and I walk all the way out to the far end where there is a fence. I see five wooden poles lined up along the fence and pressed into the soil, standing up. I wonder if I\\u2019m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they\\u2019re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They\\u2019re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest. We\\u2019re all looking into the dirt. It\\u2019s a fascinating garden walk in the night. He finds a big snail with a grey-silver spiral shell. He taps lightly on the shell with a stick to show us. Then there\\u2019s something about talking cats. In another scene, I\\u2019m possibly in danger. It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m running, running, running. I\\u2019m dancing as part of a dance company. We\\u2019re rehearsing. I\\u2019m in the locker room getting ready to dance, but also scared to be found.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a conference with my husband. He is supposed to be presenting an emotional release, inter-relational class. He writes his name and the class title on a piece of paper at a particular time slot. We go back to our hotel room. In the next day or two, we show up at his class, but nobody is there. He is upset and is looking around, wondering what happened. A man comes out with the paper schedule and says, \\u201cHey, here is the schedule. You were scheduled to teach, but you aren't going to anymore. The class was bumped.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t empathetic and he just walks away. My husband is angry because he believes in the work and was really looking forward to teaching it. I\\u2019m somewhat relieved because I didn\\u2019t think many people would come - the conference isn\\u2019t well-organized and most people are going to classes run by people with big names, mostly yoga. I go back to the room. My husband goes to the pool to swim it off. Then I\\u2019m in the hotel room. It\\u2019s a penthouse suite. There\\u2019s something about curtains opening and closing, people coming in and going out. The scene changes and the guy who was in charge of the schedule is now an eye doctor working with two other doctors. I\\u2019m waiting for my turn - it\\u2019s a walk-in clinic. He turns out to be my doctor. I\\u2019m concerned because of how cold and unfeeling he was earlier. But now in this position, he\\u2019s kind and thorough and a very good doctor.\"],[\"I am in another personality, I'm not myself. It\\u2019s as if I\\u2019m living many days, months perhaps. There is a scene about a pink dress with white straps and a discussion about how it\\u2019s not a good dress for me, but it\\u2019s good if you\\u2019re more of a sporty type. There\\u2019s another scene on a beach, another in a house...just going through regular life.\"],[\"I am at the office, though it\\u2019s not exactly my office - it\\u2019s on a cliff looking out over the river, rather than level with the river. I\\u2019m with a group of kids looking out the window, waitng for a rocket launch. We look out and there is a man resting and relaxing on a blanket with a young woman. The man is an older African American guy with curly grey hair. I recognize him as a retired basketball player. I say, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s Lebron James or maybe it\\u2019s Micheal Jordan. He worked long and hard at his career and now he can just relax and enjoy the rest.\\u201d In another scene, I\\u2019m on a boat. There are big whales swimming around the boat. Then I\\u2019m in a restaurant, enjoying a meal with a male friend (one I don\\u2019t know from waking life). As we walk through the restaurant, we see people who we know. We stay until after hours.\"],[\"I am in Elizabeth\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the house I\\u2019ve always known since I was young. We\\u2019ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I\\u2019ve brought isn\\u2019t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, \\u201cSee how tall the ceiling is?! It\\u2019s always been this tall.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYes, so tall!\\u201d Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can\\u2019t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn\\u2019t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she\\u2019ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, \\u201cOh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I\\u2019ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.\\u201d She\\u2019s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I\\u2019m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day. When I go to her office this time, it\\u2019s different. There are walls around the office. She\\u2019s there, but the bears are not.\"],[\"My husband has just come home. As he was walking under a bridge, a woman slid her hand down his leg. He stopped and had sex with her. He comes back and tells me as if it were fine. I am livid. I get aggressive in my words and actions. I poke him really hard in the ribs and push him back. He is turning me into the person in the wrong. I am so angry that he would do this and act like it is okay because it happened under the bridge and she invited the encounter.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching as a group of people are training for combat. It seems to be a private army. Brad Pitt jumps into the courtyard. He confronts the leader. He says he wants to meet him in hand to hand combat. So the leader agrees. They begin this extreme demonstration of skill. Brad Pitt is wearing a big black trench coat and a mask. The guy tells him that he cannot let go while they are shaking. There\\u2019s an odd moment where the two men are in a firm grip, apparently shaking hands, but jaws clenched, muscles rigid, and sweating. All of a sudden, the leader whirls Brad Pitt across the courtyard. He hits a huge door, but then picks up a hose and sprays the leader down with high pressure. He is then accepted into the tribe.\"],[\"An extremely tall and thin Asian man in jeans is standing in front of a classroom of sorts. He has discovered his genetic profile. He\\u2019s with his girlfriend. He\\u2019s extremely upset because he has a particular gene that should give him an extremely high level of intelligence. However, he doesn\\u2019t judge himself as that intelligent, even though from the outside he definitely is. He\\u2019s pacing with so much agitation. Something shifts in him. He decides that he will kill himself, not only himself, but also his girlfriend. He\\u2019s going to kill anyone else who stands in their way.\"],[\"I am walking through the woods with a group of people. Tad is there in this group, too. He lingers towards the back and I slow down to linger with him. We walk closer together and brush shoulders and hands as we talk. He pulls me over and begins kissing me. It\\u2019s intoxicating. We make love in a clearing. Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There\\u2019s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I\\u2019m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there\\u2019s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I\\u2019ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I\\u2019ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend. My friend is at a bar and I tell them what\\u2019s going on. I laugh. Then I\\u2019m suddenly at the bar, outside. I can see stuffed animal penguins in the grass - one on its side and one on its feet, walking towards the water. There\\u2019s another moment with Tad - beautiful and romantic coming together that I wish I could remember better.\"],[\"The dream starts all over again. The second time around I am conscious that it is repeating and I\\u2019m getting a second chance. I recall how things ended and people died. I am changing how I engage in conversation based on what I know now and in hopes of changing the outcome. I am at a magical farm/garden home with my son. It belongs to Heather and is a dream place - I don\\u2019t know it from waking life. A brook runs through it with irises and other beautiful plants growing and blooming alongside. There is a lake, too. I see large willow trees that create sweet places to rest. I also see other trees, flowers and gardens with food growing. I am exploring the land with my son. Heather deadheads some flowers and gives my son a huge purple iris blossom. He carries it around for a while, then places it on a rock as an altar. There are natural and wild altars all around. Heather and her adult daughter live in a large tree that was once hollowed out by lightning. They have converted the inside into their home. They invite us in for tea. This is where the dream gives me an opportunity to change my responses. She is asking me questions about my husband and work and values. The second time around, I am able to respond more deeply and truly, moving past the initial superficial social awkwardness to what is meaningful.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a retreat - a weekend getaway with my husband and son. We\\u2019ve rented a house. I\\u2019m upstairs in the bathroom. My son is with me in the bathroom sitting at a table. I\\u2019m going to the bathroom, then realizing that my husband\\u2019s brother is there with me. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. I walk out without flushing the toilet. I also take off my shirt, but am again surprised that it\\u2019s not my husband who\\u2019s with me, but his brother. Then my husband comes home and goes up to the bathroom. He had been out. He looks into the toilet and is upset. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. Now I\\u2019m in an office building or a house - not mine or one I recognize. My friend is sitting on the kitchen counter. She looks at me as if she wants something from me. She wants to show me a picture she made. There is a window and a butterfly bush outside the window. Butterflies are flying around. My husband is standing there at the window and tells me how much he enjoys getting away for the weekend.\"],[\"This dream feels more complex than I can properly remember. It is of multiple realities and nothing is really. There is a hidden city within a city. There are sex workers and sex clubs hidden behind or within the matrix of a restaurant. People are being tracked on their cellphones. Places disappear and are forgotten, or only remembered as a dream, wondering if they ever existed, wondering if we ever actually visited these places, or if we were always in a dream the whole time. Others are trying to create or control the consensual reality.\"],[\"At the last minute, Burning Man is happening this year. It\\u2019s very low key, but still in the desert. You just arrive and buy tickets at $15/person. You can also purchase rooms for $10/night. I go with my husband. We park the car on the side of the road, then walk through rusted out picked apart cars and airplanes with a bunch of white men smoking and drinking beer. We see our friends Diane and Warren in line. Diane offers to buy our tickets. I think it\\u2019s so nice of her. I then wonder what we\\u2019re going to do about our sleeping situation. We didn\\u2019t bring sleeping pads or blankets, so we\\u2019ll be sleeping in the car through the cold night and just throwing clothes over us. Now I think we might be able to afford a night or so in the hotel because Diane bought our tickets. We are walking through the festival. It\\u2019s more like a regular festival with vendors rather than Burning Man\\u2019s creative form of energy exchange and generous artistic sharing. As we continue to walk, we end up on a concrete street with hotels and office buildings. My husband looks up into a window and it\\u2019s cracked by a bullet hole. There is blood splattered all over the window. We don\\u2019t know if it just happened or if it\\u2019s been there a long time. We also don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an artistic expression of some kind. We don\\u2019t know if or how or where to report it and we keep on walking. But I have a feeling someone is dead in the hotel bathtub up there. Diane looks at a building on our side of the street. She exclaims about the black and green obsidian architectural accents on the building and around the windows. She thinks it would be wonderful to live in such a place because of the protection afforded by this stone. I think it\\u2019s beautiful, too. I like the idea of living in a place like that. We keep on walking. Then we are at the exit point of the festival where we get food to go and catch a bus to go back to our car. We\\u2019ve done this a couple days already and have our favorite dishes. I have been picking up a noodle bowl with a friend of mine (who I don\\u2019t know from waking life). We\\u2019re either really early or really late. The guy who makes our noodle bowl sees us and he secretly makes our food. But he can\\u2019t give it to us yet. So I go to the front and my friend stays and waits for our food. I\\u2019m waiting for him. The food is delivered to him, but then he never returns to me. It is revealed to me that he was trying to find me, but he stepped out into the road and was run over and killed by a car. All that\\u2019s left of him is a small clump or rat hair and crushed rat bones in the gutter. I\\u2019m concerned but not very upset. It seems more strange than awful. Then my stomach is not feeling up to eating, but I know I need to eat. I stand in line at a deli counter and ask if they serve hot sandwiches. They hand me a menu and I\\u2019m also trying to squint at and read the menu on the wall. I can\\u2019t read either, but they tell me they don\\u2019t make hot sandwiches for dinner but not now, so I go on. I go to the back where there is a bakery. I stand at the counter and no one else is there. The baker and owner of the bakery comes out from the back. He loves everything about baking. He\\u2019s telling me about all the ethnic baking styles he does. I say I want something warm and hot. He asks me what I like. I say I like hot. He asks me what kind of hot and I say \\u201cspicy.\\u201d He asks me what kind of spicy and I say \\u201cwarm spicy.\\u201d I\\u2019m not giving him a clear idea of what I like. He shows me a tray of baked goods and invites me to try it. I love it. I\\u2019m sitting on the side nibbling on this savory dish. Then a big group of people arrives and they start looking at all the sweet dishes. One person comes and sits next to me and eats their dish. I go up to the front and see they have a tray of sugar glazed sticky buns in the shape of mice. They tell me these are covered with raspberry sauce and filled with blueberry cream. So I take one and they ring me up at the register. They tell me it\\u2019s $12. I\\u2019m surprised that one pastry would cost so much. I tell them I already paid for the savory treat. They don\\u2019t really believe me, but then the owner comes out and tells them I did pay, so I only owe a few bucks. I feel nourished and I feel good about this exchange.\"],[\"I am teaching a yoga class. I\\u2019m subbing for my friend. It\\u2019s like I just pop up out of bed and there I am in the yoga studio. So I\\u2019m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it\\u2019s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don\\u2019t know who they are or where we are or what I\\u2019m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it\\u2019s just so odd. So I\\u2019m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren\\u2019t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I\\u2019m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can\\u2019t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it\\u2019s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn\\u2019t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It\\u2019s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I\\u2019m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can\\u2019t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I\\u2019ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. It has the feeling of Burning Man in that there are people normally dressed and others wildly dressed, some are drinking and others are sober, some are on stronger drugs. We have come up with a new drug that doesn\\u2019t have a name yet. It\\u2019s like a combination of Molly and something else. There is a very artistic creative guy dancing and frolicking around. He comes outside and he takes a piece of paper that he\\u2019s drawn and written on, and he posts it high on a tree. He\\u2019s tall and he can reach this high. Someone gets it down and reads the paper. They say, \\u201cOh my gosh, this is the name of the drug. It\\u2019s Meggy. It\\u2019s a combination of Molly and Peggy.\\u201d The party dissipates a bit. I go home with my husband. We go upstairs. This is not a home I recognize from waking life. We decide to take our dose of Meggy. We know it takes a while to begin. We wander around. I get a book and start to read. I notice my vision starting to change - my right eye that in waking life is already damaged, starts to get really puffy and slotty so I can\\u2019t see well, and my other eye starts to change as well. I feel like it\\u2019s starting to set in. Someone comes and knocks on the door. We let him in and he says, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d So we all get in the car. There are cars filling up with other people. I see a blue car that was earlier in the day quite nice, but now it\\u2019s beat up a bit and covered in mud. We\\u2019re all trying really hard to get out fast, so something is going on. We arrive at a rundown hotel. One of the girls steps in and she\\u2019s trying to talk to the concierge. I\\u2019m watching her from a different perspective - as if from behind the concierge\\u2019s head. I\\u2019m looking her up and down. She\\u2019s dressed as a very prim and proper lady, all in white with white pumps. But she has dark black circles under her eyes and she\\u2019s really pale. She doesn\\u2019t look quite right. All of us have taken Meggy. Then there is violence. The woman transforms into a wild animal and kills him. The guy in charge of the whole operation has turned into a grizzly bear. I turn into a wild cat. Everyone is turning into wild predators. There\\u2019s a graphic scene in the elevator where I bat somebody\\u2019s head off. There\\u2019s guts and brain matter everywhere. All the animals congregate because we have to get together and get out. We all transform into somewhat human form and get out. A lot of time passes. I\\u2019ve separated out from the group and am trying to live a normal human life. I\\u2019m driving in my car down a country road. I end up at a farm. I see the guy who was in charge. Something has shifted in him and there is peace in him. He welcomes me. He takes me on a tour of the farm and introduces me to the people who live there. It\\u2019s an orphanage. There are some people who were originally part of the Meggy group. The effects of the drug have changed. Now they use it only occasionally to spark creativity or connection to each other and the Earth. They\\u2019ve created a completely self-sustainable farm, growing vegetables and fruit, milking goats and cows, raising chickens...they have found a way to make peace with themselves and the Earth. They take care of the Earth and the Earth takes care of them by providing food, shelter and home.\"],[\"There were a lot of New Year\\u2019s parties. Many of them were in conference rooms in the same hotel. They were for different echelons of society. You had to have personal invitations to some of the more exclusive parties. People were also going out of the hotel to other parties that required invitations and secret directions. It\\u2019s really crowded and not entertaining. I mostly just wander from party to party and room to room, feeling a bit awkward as people do at parties. I decide to go home at the end of the night. Before I leave, I see some chalk drawing on the ground and people are on their knees drawing. I wake the next morning and start baking. There are cupcakes and a couple cakes in the oven. I\\u2019m making a big round loaf of puffy poppyseed bread. Someone comes and knocks on the door urgently telling me that I have to come right now. So there are only 7 minutes left on the timer, but I have to go. I tell my dad the instructions really quickly. As I\\u2019m pulling on my shoes and coat, I realize I am starving and haven\\u2019t had any breakfast. I pull the bread out and tear off a piece, but this deflates the bread. It won\\u2019t be very good now and it\\u2019s still a bit wet and gooey on the inside. I put it back in the oven and tell my dad to take everything out in 5 minutes. I run off and follow my friend. We are running past houses and it\\u2019s really early, still dark. We run towards the harbor. I see a huge bird flying, but it looks more like a crawfish or koi fish with black feathers. There are other birds and dolphins and whales in the water. I wonder what this portends.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark and crowded. I\\u2019m running away and trying to escape before Ursula finds me. She\\u2019s looking for me in the crowds. I can tell she wants to harm me. There is a conference and gathering of people dressed in futuristic clothes, all in black with coats. Somebody lets me borrow their big puffy black coat to help hide me. I put this on. There is a row of people who tell me I can blend in with their group. I think it will be a solution to sit in that row with them. Before the conference starts, I go to the bathroom. Ursula and Gemma walk in right behind me. They don\\u2019t see me and I slip into a stall. But Ursula steps into the stall next to me, to my right. Gemma continues to wait in line and I don\\u2019t know how to escape without her seeing me. I think I wait until they both use the other stall because there are only two stalls. I think it\\u2019s safe so I go out, but they are washing their hands. Gemma sees me, though. I join the row of people who told me I could hide with them, but Ursula spots me. I escape the conference center in my big puffy black coat. I go down the street to a small house where I see a boy digging in the dirt with a shovel and pale. His mom is standing on the porch. She offers to help hide me.\"],[\"My son and I are on a sidewalk. We stop at a little square of a dirt where a tree was removed. There is a hole where the tree was. Jack comes by with a red wagon or stroller. My son really likes him. They\\u2019re talking and playing and having a good time. Jack invites us to his house to play with his kids. So we go over and my son is in the playroom with him and his kids. Jack\\u2019s wife joins me in the kitchen. She brings an armful of dresses because I need a dress for the evening. She says that she feels like she\\u2019s already met me and I feel the same way. We look a lot alike and we are the same size. We have other things in common, too. She\\u2019s showing me the dresses and encouraging me to try them on for the dinner tonight. We\\u2019re having a good time. It\\u2019s time to go and I gather up my son.\"],[\"I go to an address to find a new dress for Trina, my former boss. I\\u2019ve never been here before. When I walk in, my jaw drops in amazement. It\\u2019s a huge barn that has been converted into a boutique with gorgeous gowns hanging up on the walls all the way up to the ceiling. I\\u2019m looking for a particular style because the other dress was torn. It\\u2019s like an art gallery. I find a similar dress but with more vibrant colors. I ask for help getting it down. The woman who works here is thin and old with dry wrinkled skin. Her eyes are very bright and alive. She seems to know something I don\\u2019t know yet. Then she tells me that they have a dream group that meets here every other Tuesday. The man who leads this dream group is so eccentric and people really love him and adore him. I\\u2019m a little interested but also wary and doubtful of a man with such charisma and appeal. Then I\\u2019m walking down a hall in this big barn which I now realize is a retreat center. I see a sandwich board with an announcement for this dream workshop which happens to be this day later this evening. I then encounter this beautiful man in the hallway and there is something so magnetizing between the two of us. We are immediately drawn together and he\\u2019s pressing me against the wall. We are having an ecstatic sexual encounter, even though I\\u2019ve never seen him before. Then we smoothe down our clothes and go our individual ways. The old woman from the art dress show has arranged for me to have dinner with this dream teacher. So I go and am surprised to see the elegant dining room within the barn. I\\u2019m sitting at a table by myself. I order some food and this woman comes by. I\\u2019m loving my food - bread with oil for dipping. The woman pulls the bread out of my hand and starts to eat. I\\u2019m fighting her for it and think it\\u2019s so beyond that she\\u2019s decided to come up and eat my food! We\\u2019re having a fight about it and she just doesn\\u2019t understand. She wants to sue me not letting her eat my own food. Then the dream teacher\\u2019s assistant sits at the other side - I don\\u2019t know if they are a man or woman. The man from the hallway comes and sits directly across from me and gives me this smile. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that man in the hallway was this dream teacher.\\u201d I feel a bit awkward and don\\u2019t know what to say. He\\u2019s smiling at me in a knowing kind of laughing way and is enjoying my little shock. He introduces himself as if meeting me for the first time. I play along. His assistant kind of knows what\\u2019s going on. They order the food for the whole table and seem to know the menu well. The food arrives - noodles, lobster, buttery decadent amazing melt in your mouth meal with the most exquisite wine. My senses are turned on to full ecstasy. We begin talking about dreams. I end up going to the dream group and I can feel why people love him. My whole self is turned on again. I go every week. It seems like every other week we have this amazing sexual experience together and the other weeks he\\u2019s just focused on teaching and being there for all the students. I accept that this is the education and experience. Our relationship is amazing. There are no emotional obligations or expectations. Each class, the chairs are adjusted. In the last part of the dream, I remember a woman sitting in front of me. She\\u2019s a younger woman and hasn\\u2019t had any children, so her body hasn\\u2019t been stretched and it\\u2019s still in a bouncy young shape. She\\u2019s wearing a teeny tiny zebra print bikini bottoms. She\\u2019s leaning over in a provocative way then arching her back across the back of the chair revealing her beautiful sexy body and trying to catch his attention. I feel unhappy and insecure. My friend sitting next to me tells me, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it. He\\u2019s completely yours, through and through.\\u201d\"],[\"I am in the back of a building. There\\u2019s a man who really loves me. We\\u2019re wanting to be together, Then I am with this man and a group of priestesses building an altar. Gwen, Erin and Kem are there. Ursula is conspicuously not there. We put items on the altar, each of us contributing to different altars. The image that is most clear to me is a pile of tarot cards spread across the table, a picture of red shoes and an actual pair of red satin pointe shoes at the center of the altar.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a conference. I look across the way and see a yoga studio. The studio is struggling to keep its doors open. I see what looks to be an image of Ana Forrest, an international yoga teacher. She\\u2019s doing padangusthasana. As I look, I realize, it\\u2019s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it\\u2019s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it\\u2019s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don\\u2019t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she\\u2019s participating in to raise funds for the school. She\\u2019s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn\\u2019t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.\"],[\"There was so much to this dream but I\\u2019ve forgotten most of it. It felt important. People have made sand sculptures. Three people have made turtles. Two were too round. The third one is life-like. I see it with sand roses, then I see it lined with blue beer cans. Then I see it standing on its back fins on top of one of the other turtles. It is waving its fins in the air and saying: \\u201cThis is how a turtle is supposed to look. See how flat I am?\\u201d\"],[\"I am a black woman. They are doing my makeup - my eyebrows are in the wrong place. They draw them lower and do my eyes with thick eyeliner, shadow and mascara. They then start to put foundation on my face - it\\u2019s much lighter than my skin tone. They are covering up my natural brows and the rest of my face in a very thick application. I look in the mirror and do like what I see, but am concerned about how I\\u2019ll look when the makeup fades during the day and after I wash my face at night. Now, we are entering New York City through a portal. We are taken through a series of halls and rooms, peering in through glass windows. I am taken to a room with a large bed. The man who lives here is very wealthy and eccentric. He has strange sexual tastes and there is an understanding that we all must participate in some way to get out of here and continue on our journey. Now I'm in a basement or garage with a team. We need to find clues; each clue leads to the next. We\\u2019re doing well, but someone has tampered with the room and one of the clues in the sequence is missing. The floor is grey cement. There are shelves of books and odds and ends. There are other odd contraptions throughout the space. It\\u2019s dark with just a dim garage light. I\\u2019m now going to a performance in a theater. My husband and I don\\u2019t have tickets. When we arrive, they show us to our box seats. I see a friend from town and her husband. Their son is just a few days older than my son. We are taken to the seats front and center - very conspicuous. Now, I am in the portal rooms again. The man is in bed under the covers with at least three other people. I am standing at the side of the bed and ask him about the mattress composition. He says it\\u2019s made of wormwood. Interesting. There are beads of creamy substance in the seams. I pick them up and roll them into a ball and think it\\u2019s some kind of glue leaking through. I show it to him and ask him what it is. He pops it in his mouth, eats it and gives me a look. He laughs at my naivety.\"],[\"There\\u2019s an awkward dream with a former friend, Liz. It\\u2019s like Edward and I have given her an itemized receipt or invoice for her to review and pay. She\\u2019s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There\\u2019s another dream where we\\u2019re looking at a house. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull. In another dream scene, I go into a bakery through the side door where baking scientists are discussing plans for the day. I\\u2019m not sure whether to leave or stay and ask my question. I don\\u2019t feel particularly welcome in this food laboratory.\"],[\"Someone is knocking on our door. We were expecting visitors, so I\\u2019m not surprised. The knock feels threatening, though. Someone goes to look through the peephole and sees a threatening looking man - big and rough, a local Hawaiian guy. There\\u2019s a whole busload of big, rough guys. I also see Tan France from the \\u201cQueer Eye\\u201d show. We realize that if we stay here, our lives will be in danger. We don\\u2019t open the door and we don\\u2019t let them in, but they know we\\u2019re inside. Eventually they give up for now and drive away. We know that if we stay, it could be a problem. We pack up and bring our plant starters in the RV. We drive a bit and are supposed to rendezvous with someone with a mask to buy and bring to my brother-in-law. We park the RV in a field for the night. A big truck comes driving towards us really fast and stops just in front of us. We\\u2019re afraid it might keep going and run into us. Someone knocks on our door, but we don\\u2019t want to open the door because we don\\u2019t know who they are or what they could bring with them. They end up opening the door themselves. I see a couple Latina girls. We know their family and realize these are the people who we are supposed to meet up with. The mom and dad come in and we\\u2019re concerned that all these people are in a small space. She shows us this mask - it\\u2019s like a Gonzo mask, rubber and blue with a bulbous nose - one of her creations. She shows us how to wear it - she puts it over her nose and then says, \\u201cWhen I take it off, I just pull it down over my waist like this.\\u201d I don\\u2019t think she realizes how this looks like a strap-on.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying at a big house. I\\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment with a woman who reminds me of Geri (a friend who worked for Burning Man and who I camped with a couple times) for 11am the next day. There are a lot of people here. I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It\\u2019s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn\\u2019t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I\\u2019m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She\\u2019s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can\\u2019t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I\\u2019m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I\\u2019m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren\\u2019t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day\\u2019s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I\\u2019m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I\\u2019m waiting at the couches - I\\u2019ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I\\u2019m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it\\u2019s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I\\u2019m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I\\u2019m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I\\u2019m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn\\u2019t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don\\u2019t want to do it anymore and I\\u2019m not going to come back. She says, \\u201cWell, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle. This is not something you give up so quickly.\\u201d I doubt myself and wonder if this is a good idea even though it doesn\\u2019t feel right or fitting. I agree to come back one more time to give it another chance.\"],[\"This is the last part of the dream: I\\u2019m with a group of people in a tropical place. There\\u2019s red dirt like Hawaii, or maybe Costa Rica. My husband along with a couple (our friends and both yoga teachers), and a few others. We\\u2019ve been looking at houses. We come to this piece of land. Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We\\u2019re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they\\u2019re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They\\u2019re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we\\u2019re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings. I see people making the paper boats with bits of paper they found in the trash. There\\u2019s also some kind of healing going on.\"],[\"I wake up from a nightmare screaming for the police.\"],[\"A dinner event. A wild animal runs through, injured. I chase after this animal. There are other wild animals running with me. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll blend in with them and they will not notice I\\u2019m human, but animal like them. We\\u2019ll run together and catch up with the injured one ahead. A man who runs with these animals has joined us and is running just behind me down the path. One of the animals falls but is able to get up and continue. Scene change. A group of people gather on a rooftop. They are making a temporary home each night on this roof, setting up tents, cooking food. A man who used to live in his van at the river is there. He now has a truck and it doesn\\u2019t appear that he lives in the truck, so I think he\\u2019s bought a house. But he is traveling with us. Every night we set everything up then take everything down in the morning. We go on a journey during the day, taking the truck. We pull out all our kitchen and sleeping supplies at night. One night, a woman takes out a fancy grill - so much nicer and easier to use than the one we\\u2019ve been using because there is no need to hook up propane. You just push a button for the heat and another button for the water. I feel a little ashamed of my smaller one, but realize mine serves a purpose because it is smaller and more easily transported.\"],[\"I find out from Gail that the ladies didn\\u2019t really want to start meeting again with me. But they were humoring me. It feels really uncomfortable. I find this out while sitting with Gail at a small particle board table that has been painted and carved to look nicer. Gail\\u2019s oldest daughter is picking at the table and ruining it. Gai\\u2019s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She\\u2019s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks. She looks so beautiful and I\\u2019m envious, but know I couldn\\u2019t wear either of those outfits because I\\u2019m not tall and thin. Irene is going to meet her lover. Then she ends up going to the second story. Katy is there and they are having a wonderful deep engaging conversation. Again, I\\u2019m feeling left out as if I don\\u2019t belong and have nothing of value to contribute. On a floor above is a barber shop. My dad is getting his hair cut. My mom is there, too. Then somehow this barber shop is in another building - a hospital. Ted tells me he\\u2019s been enjoying talking to and seeing my parents on the floor just above where he works. I\\u2019m happy to see Ted and talk with him. My mom and I then go out to dinner. We\\u2019re sitting in a dark restaurant and a man is sitting with us. He feels a bit creepy. The waiter comes by and has a thick Irish accent. I order fries and then my mom orders. Then the waiter and the man start talking with each other in Gaelic. I\\u2019m wanting to interrupt so I can speak and learn the language again. The guy at my table is reading a poem. I ask if the word means garter as I make a motion of pulling a garter up over my leg. They look at me and laugh as if humoring me. They are laughing as if it was some sort of sexual innuendo that I didn\\u2019t catch. The waiter disappears and doesn\\u2019t return to our table. He has to declare bankruptcy but is being hunted down for money he owes. I find him in a crowded cafe with multiple serving stations. He\\u2019s making eggs with parmesan cheese to serve and judged. If he gets the cooking job, he\\u2019ll be able to pay his bills. I join him at the stove and help plate the eggs. I see a pile of powdered sugar on the plate, but think it should be on the dessert plate instead. His girlfriend is also helping. I scoop up the powdered sugar but don\\u2019t have a place for it while she plops savory sauce on the plate. It\\u2019s messy but it tastes good. I think it tastes so good that the appearance won\\u2019t matter.\"],[\"An old building made of stone with old fixtures. It\\u2019s two maybe three stories with big wide stairs. I\\u2019m walking up to the second floor. There\\u2019s something about water, learning about the power and magic of water. There\\u2019s a feeling of conflict, misunderstanding, fear, manipulation, and yet an attempt at forming a common goal - a goal of learning then teaching. The power goes out in the building. Then, we\\u2019re in the hallway sweeping up dirt and hair that has fallen off people\\u2019s heads over the years. In another room, a class is beginning. Someone hands me an amulet of lava stone with red jewels and hammered iron. I wear it during the class. The class is a movement almost like yoga. I wear the amulet to charge it with power. I\\u2019m given two other amulets to wear and keep with me and charge up as well.\"],[\"I am touring a large apartment building. Units are being made available as people move. Some are moving out completely, others are moving for a better view. When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I\\u2019m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we\\u2019ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That\\u2019s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I\\u2019d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There\\u2019s a sign about reservations required. It\\u2019s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It\\u2019s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I\\u2019m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don\\u2019t want to pay because there\\u2019s only fifteen minutes left. I\\u2019m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn\\u2019t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we\\u2019re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It\\u2019s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I\\u2019m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there\\u2019s no place for me to sit. I\\u2019m watching my son to see if he\\u2019s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t find my husband. I\\u2019m at some kind of party at a country club or public pool. First I get a video call from my mom and sister. She\\u2019s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She\\u2019s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I\\u2019m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I\\u2019m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he\\u2019s actually swimming. He\\u2019s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I\\u2019m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can\\u2019t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I\\u2019m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he\\u2019s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I\\u2019m so mad at him. And he\\u2019s just shrugging me off. He tells me that he\\u2019s been doing other stuff, too, and not telling me about it: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been drinking six cups of coffee a day, drinking beer everyday, getting high everyday and smoking cigarettes again. I\\u2019ve been hiding from you the whole time because I know how upset you get.\\u201d I\\u2019m so mad that I want to beat him up. The woman comes back. She\\u2019s watching and smoking. She has tattoos all over her body and they aren\\u2019t well done or tastefully designed. She lifts up her shirt to show her belly. I can see she is very far along. The baby is lying sideways which isn\\u2019t good. I\\u2019m continuing to get more mad. She asks him where to send the invoice for the cigarettes. He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It\\u2019s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It\\u2019s \\u201cWhyNotHard\\u201d or \\u201cWhyNot&Hard\\u201d or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. I\\u2019m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he\\u2019s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we\\u2019re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together. One of them starts to sing and tells me she\\u2019s been watching and listening to the whole drama. She\\u2019s laughing because she\\u2019s been there before. They are all singing a song and the scene shifts. It\\u2019s like we are in a music video. We are standing under trees by a body of water. There are brown leaves covering the ground. I see an ice blue woman naked and lying partially hidden under the leaves. I wonder if she is me. I can\\u2019t recall what happens next. But then I am trying to teach a yoga class to a group of people who are wanting really advanced trick poses. I can do and teach these poses but I want to slowly warm them up and prepare them to do it safely. But, nobody is really paying attention. They have this better than thou attitude that turns me off. I don't want to continue teaching to people who are so disrespectful.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house or residential school. I\\u2019m taking my examinations - writing, math and dance. Eac person has their own private space to write. I go outside to the yard with my blue books and find a stone grotto to sit in. it\\u2019s dark outside, night. After I finish writing, I go back inside for the dance examination. This is a small performance based audition. I enter into the audition late and displace another woman who was until now guaranteed a spot in the school. Afterward, people begin talking about my skill and wondering where I learned to dance like that. I walk into another room where they keep the wild leopards. There is a pool with rocks along the side and some trees - an attempt to replicate a watering hole in their natural environment. I see a huge one - a paleolithic version of the leopard. This one is standing on a rock in the water. A younger adolescent leopard is lying splayed out on the beach, mouth open wide and teeth showing - it reminds me of a skinned lion rug I\\u2019ve seen before in waking life. There\\u2019s also a paleolithic leopard kitten crawling around the rocks. I'm surprised to see these wild animals inside a concrete room without windows. I go to another room that is a workroom with tools, like a woodwork or metal shop.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m downtown in an urban environment that I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It\\u2019s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There\\u2019s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I\\u2019m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn\\u2019t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it\\u2019s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn\\u2019t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren\\u2019t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a car. We are driving down a slippery wet road at night. My son is in the backseat with a man. My husband is driving and I\\u2019m in the passenger seat. We\\u2019re leaving the house for an errand. A family has moved into our apartment with us and has brought all their kitchen supplies including a large cast iron pan, a whole collection of knives, spatulas, spoons and other things. Before we left, I was making an egg on a pan with a non-stick surface. Whenever I stepped out of the kitchen, the mom came and moved my egg to the cast iron. I moved it back and she moved it again. It was really irritating and I wanted them out. I couldn\\u2019t imagine blending our households. So I left. We are dropping off her husband so he can pick up more things. He\\u2019s aware of her controlling ways in the household and especially in the kitchen. He\\u2019s silent and apologetic in his silence. We drop him off at a house in another neighborhood. Then my husband drops me off at a gym for a class. Other women are sitting on the street waiting for them to open. I lean my chiropractic table against a garage door. Behind the garage door are supplies for the dance and exercise classes. I can see numbers that tally the equipment to help keep track of it all when people use them for classes and return them later. A woman comes to sit beside me. She recognizes me and offers me a drink from her flask. I take it then the teacher comes and opens the doors. We all go inside and are all tipsy. The class begins but it is disorganized. It\\u2019s kind of like an adult gymnastics class and it feels like a gym I used to go to when I was younger - balance beams, parallel bars, tumbling floor and vault. A woman who identifies herself as Tiffany (I don\\u2019t know her from waking life) invites me to her family\\u2019s home after class. I go with her. Her aunt is sitting in the backseat and we are going to visit her mom, Norma.\"],[\"This dream is remembered mostly backwards. The last scene of the dream I look down at my phone and it\\u2019s lit up with Jeremy\\u2019s name. He\\u2019s calling. I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it\\u2019s him even though he\\u2019s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I\\u2019m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it\\u2019s not a video call, I can see him. He\\u2019s sitting on an oversized chair. He\\u2019s very awkward. He says, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s Jeremy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI know. Hi, how are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to be light. Then he says, \\u201cI owe you an explanation.\\u201d So then he starts to share. I can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I\\u2019m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It\\u2019s urgent. I\\u2019m running through snow. It\\u2019s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We\\u2019re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It\\u2019s a big pool and I\\u2019m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn\\u2019t notice that the water has been draining until it\\u2019s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I\\u2019m at dinner. It\\u2019s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.\"],[\"I am watching a mom I know from town. Her daughter is about the same age as my son. In waking life, she has always been discontent with being a mother. I\\u2019ve tried to not judge her way of complaining about her daughter being a distraction to her art, because it so far of how I perceive motherhood. She has made a deal for her birthday that the time with her daughter will be front loaded to this time of life, so she can get it over with. Somehow, her daughter will grow older faster, while the mom ages at the same rate. So time is expanded in some way. It\\u2019s unusual to watch. Now I\\u2019m in an airplane and my brother in law is flying it. I\\u2019m grateful for his skill - he flies helicopters in waking life. He\\u2019s taking off and we\\u2019re gaining momentum, though not climbing high into the air as quickly as I expected. He\\u2019s staying low to the ground and identifying men who he knows as officers in the military. He flies directly over their head - the sergeant, the colonel and the captain. We are escaping. We have to get out because a war is coming.\"],[\"I am hiding out with my husband at the border of Oregon and California. We are on the Oregon side in some bushes. We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We\\u2019ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we\\u2019ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn\\u2019t have to smear the lotion in the dog\\u2019s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they\\u2019re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They\\u2019ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I\\u2019m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I\\u2019m thinking that maybe he\\u2019ll drive because he isn\\u2019t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river. He has found a stick and a net on a long pole, like a pool skimmer. It\\u2019s broken around the edges and the net is slightly torn. A couple comes by with their dog on a leash. They let the dog off leash and the dog jumps in the water where my son was pretending to fish with his net. My son just stands and watches at first. But then he wants to try to fish for the dog. I tell him not to. There\\u2019s a little back and forth between us. I then tell my son that we will have to go to another part of the river or I\\u2019ll take away the net. I\\u2019d rather the people just leave with their dog instead of continuing to throw the stick into the water for the dog to fetch. Eventually I get my son to draw back and watch until they decide to leave.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a boat. I\\u2019m with my husband and son and somebody else, a captain who is directing the boat. There are other boats in the water. We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I\\u2019m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he\\u2019s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I\\u2019m looking around and notice it\\u2019s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I\\u2019m looking through the papers and see that there\\u2019s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I\\u2019m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He\\u2019s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It\\u2019s really rough and she hasn\\u2019t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It\\u2019s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I\\u2019m at a celebration for Ted, an award\\u2019s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I\\u2019m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there. His dad, who is dead in waking life, is there and drinking a huge glass mug of whisky and ice. His mom and I are sipping nicer whisky that I had brought. I make eye contact with him, smile and nod my head in congratulations for his accomplishments.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with a woman who reminds me of a combination of Jules and CeeCee - a thin bony woman. We\\u2019ve snuck into the hotel room. Someone else was here earlier and left their computer. They were doing research on a man and following a track of blood and other clues. I\\u2019m getting ready for bed but not feeling entirely comfortable. There are two beds. She seems a little wired. In the bathroom there is blood in the toilet and toilet paper. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s my blood or hers. The beds are set up with a lot of pillows. The blankets are on the ground. She pulls the blinds closed and the curtains are still open. The blinds are moving from just being closed. She was on the computer and downloaded the search history and printed it out. She hasn\\u2019t looked at the papers yet, but she will do that tomorrow. I\\u2019m in my bed now. She\\u2019s in hers. I feel her reaching over to me and I feel really uncomfortable. I\\u2019m not feeling safe enough to fall asleep. Tomorrow is Easter.\"],[\"All the women have gathered for my friend Talia\\u2019s birth. We\\u2019re inside a large room. She\\u2019s standing up higher and radiant in her pregnant fullness. She starts to feel labor beginning. We\\u2019re watching and singing and holding space. At one point, she\\u2019s in a smaller room. I hear her say that she pooped and a woman says, \\u201cgood, this is great, this is part of it.\\u201d Then another woman who sounds like my mother shames her for pooping. She says it\\u2019s not a good thing. I wish I was there to be another voice of support. She comes out of that room, clean and very much in the fire of crowning birth. I can see a redness and opening between her legs. She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We\\u2019re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She\\u2019s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby. I think I would not be happy if I were not the first to hold my baby. We all look and see that it is a healthy baby. We bring the baby back to Talia with love and devotion.\"],[\"Elevators going up and down. A mall. I\\u2019m with my childhood friend Elizabeth watching. People are wearing unusual clothes. Gwen is recording a podcast about inter-racial relationships. A group of us are gathered for the recording. The intro to the podcast is recorded by an Asian woman in a relationship with a black man. She is describing their relationship and it\\u2019s recorded like a guided meditation in a semi-darkened room. Then the lights turn on and Gwen is speaking about inter-racial relationships between white women and black men. I\\u2019m sitting beside her as support. The scene opens up and a white woman and black man are running. People are chasing and trying to track them down. They separate for safety and hope they can find each other again.\"],[\"Returning to the farm. Mexican laborers are all sleeping on the ground, passed out in sexual ecstasy, their pants down, all men. An investigation reveals that one man found a long crystal in the dirt and in secret stimulated himself until he orgasmed and fell asleep. Somehow the other men understood what happened and used the crystal, as well. Returning to the farm, a group of people are having their own experiences and judgments. There\\u2019s a beautiful ballerina with bright red lipstick. She is the object of attraction and desire, but she has none herself. So when she feels his attraction for her, she pretends sleep. She sees herself from the outside, her face pushed up with bright red lipstick smudged on her nose. She\\u2019d like to fix her face and make herself more beautiful in her sleep, but moving would betray that she was still awake. So she stays and she sees on her cheek the evidence of pimples and many breakouts when she was younger and wishes that away. But he stands over her and wishes for her warmth, wishes for connection. And they\\u2019re both alone in their thoughts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m waking up at a festival. I\\u2019m walking through to the ocean or bay. I see that some others are still sleeping and the beds are set up to be floating over the ocean with only a white gauze curtain around for a little privacy. I\\u2019m curious about it. I see my friend Maxine walking around in a huge hoop skirt. It looks like she\\u2019s wearing a long curly wig that goes all the way to the ground. Other people are dressed up in festival attire. I don\\u2019t think I am, but I can\\u2019t sense much about myself. There\\u2019s a water slide that people go down to splash in the water. I\\u2019m supposed to be covering Sophie\\u2019s shift. I don\\u2019t know whether it starts at 9 or 9:30, but I need to get there. But now it\\u2019s raining and grey, and I know I\\u2019m in San Francisco. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019ll get there and park and be on time. It\\u2019s more complicated than I thought it would be when I agreed to help. Now I realize it\\u2019s not a chiropractic shift, but I\\u2019m subbing a yoga or meditation class for her. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in another doctor\\u2019s office. It smells like cigarette smoke and really stuffy. All the other rooms are occupied and the doctor of physical therapist is running late. There isn\\u2019t enough room to teach a class and it won\\u2019t be worth my time or energy to do this, but I\\u2019ve committed. Then there\\u2019s a scene of my sister lying on her stomach and a prince speaking with her and evaluating whether she is a good choice for him or not.\"],[\"There is a land we must pass through. I\\u2019m with a big group of people. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them from waking life. We get to a point where the tigers are. We\\u2019re strategizing and learning how to get through. We\\u2019re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It\\u2019s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don\\u2019t have anyone to pair off with, so I\\u2019m going through the motions by myself. I\\u2019m also wary of holding people\\u2019s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don\\u2019t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I\\u2019ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don\\u2019t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I\\u2019m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I\\u2019m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties. I\\u2019m sad and disappointed, I feel left out because they haven\\u2019t thought to invite me. I would like to be included.\"],[\"Something about a family portrait and me reminding the young men and their father of their deceased mom/wife. We find out that they live just down the street. I live on 25th and they live on 36th. They are going back to their home to get the portrait to show me how my gestures mimic hers exactly.\"],[\"An empty boat. A journey over the ocean or maybe just a bay. Salt water. I\\u2019m watching a person who has never captained a boat. They are gathering a crew. I know the end of the story. The chosen captain doesn\\u2019t survive the journey. I\\u2019m watching to see how this happens, wondering if the captain is murdered or dies of natural causes or has an accident of some kind. The crew is assembled. The boat is beautiful but totally empty. We all get on the boat. As the people move up and down the different levels of the boat, I'm peering through windows. There are people carrying small lanterns to light their way, others writing in journals, others sleeping, others watching the stars. I\\u2019m waiting to see where the captain is going and what will happen to the captain. Maybe by watching, it may shift the way things develop. Maybe the captain will survive. But there is no way to know. Then, a bathtub with a little girl in the tub, prepubescent, learning about puberty. Hanna is in one room. Rose is in another room. Another woman is also present. Hanna is very light in her questioning. Rose is very certain in her teaching, talking about the first blood and how to measure a ship to be as clear as possible from the beginning. Do we measure from end to end, or only the livable portion of a ship? She\\u2019s talking about how to maintain and care for the pubic hair without having razor bumps. Rose says, \\u201cWell, of course you massage first for a while.\\u201d She says this as if everyone should know. I feel ashamed that I do not know and remind myself to remember when I wake up.\"],[\"I am walking through a downtown area. The streets are dark and wet. I\\u2019m looking for a hotel restaurant and spa. I find it and it\\u2019s larger and more elegant on the inside than it appears on the outside. I go to the concierge to make an appointment at the spa. They tell me to wait in the lobby and come back when they call my name. I look over the different treatment options on the spa menu. There are only women here - it\\u2019s a women only spa. I see Rose who I think is applying for a job here as a sexocological bodyworker and some other women I don\\u2019t recognize from waking life. After some time passes, they call me up to the desk. They give me a large ticket printed on brown cardstock. It has my name on the front and information for my first time. Then they give me my assigned therapist who will give me my treatment. They lead me to the back. I go down the stairs behind them. Instead of going directly to the spa, I go to the restaurant. It\\u2019s huge with tall ceilings. People are spaced out at different tables. I sit at my assigned table. A couple other people join me. I look at the menu and the food is unusual - fine dining breakfast/brunch. I order. The food arrives and it\\u2019s a crystallized strawberry fluff. It\\u2019s delicious. The person across from me is a chef and she\\u2019s talking about how she makes a strawberry ice cream. She gets the largest strawberries and cuts them in slices and places them together to make something like a boat. She makes the ice cream from scratch. The other person sitting next to me says, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s the most wonderful thing you\\u2019ve ever had!\\u201d She promises me an invitation to a dinner party at her home. I love the idea of going to a chef\\u2019s home for dinner. Meanwhile, the spa therapists are coming around and finding the people they recognize for their treatments - there are a lot of regulars here and I might be the only new person. I\\u2019m assigned to a person named Shannon. I think they are a woman. This person comes down and everyone knows and loves her. She is one of the most sought after therapists. She is being discreet, looking around for her client, not calling out names, because we are all supposed to be anonymous here. Then she starts singing a song about herself because we don\\u2019t recognize each other. Now I realize that she identifies as \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are tall, brown skin with big black hair, very lean and strong. I realize, \\u201cThis is Shannon.\\u201d I try to get their attention once they complete their song. Most of the others have gone to receive their treatment. I reach into my bag to get my ticket. I can\\u2019t find it at first and am concerned that I won\\u2019t be able to receive my session without it. It\\u2019s tucked in between notebooks and other papers. I take it out and show them my name and their name printed on the ticket. We go out and I don\\u2019t recall the treatment. Afterwards, I\\u2019m on a beach. My dad is sitting on a beach chair next to me. There\\u2019s another older man sitting next to him and some young adults in their late twenties sitting on a surfboard in front of us. My dad comments on one of the gals wearing a little bitty red one piece swimsuit. Her body is very young and firm. My dad talks to the old man next to him, assuming the young woman is this old man\\u2019s girlfriend. He tells the old man how lucky he is. I\\u2019m disgusted by the conversation between them. I get up and walk to the shore. I see small creatures digging holes in the sand after the waves go out. I dig a hole and am finding crawdads and am pulling them out while trying to avoid their claws. I look out at the ocean. The water is so clear. I see turtles and then this creature. At first I think the creature is another turtle, but when I look more closely, it\\u2019s like a dolphin with an elephant trunk. I point it out to people. We realize that the young woman who the men were talking about is the fiancee of the older man\\u2019s son. They all go inside a dive bar and are ordering drinks and cigars and talking about the plans for the rest of the night. It\\u2019s getting late and I\\u2019m wishing to be somewhere else.\"],[\"The university sessions are over and now we\\u2019re on break. I\\u2019m done with my classes and graduating. I don\\u2019t have a plan yet. Trina is running a house and she\\u2019d like me to help. It won\\u2019t be a real use of my skills, but it\\u2019s a great situation. She\\u2019ll pay me $4,518 a month to live in the house and to respond to calls and visitors. I will also have time to do some sessions. I\\u2019ll pay $505 a month for my room and board in the house. I\\u2019m sitting across the desk from her in her office. She has all the papers prepared with the tax calculations. I sign the papers and feel at ease. I can relax into this time with a steady monthly paycheck and a safe place to live that is run by people with integrity and enough money to be generous. In another scene, I\\u2019m standing in the rain outside Whole Foods. It\\u2019s dark. I\\u2019m with my mom and grandmother. It\\u2019s COVID times so we have to wait to get in. They let us in and we put our masks on. We can\\u2019t ask for help because people aren\\u2019t available in the aisle. We are looking for breadcrumbs. We separate and my grandmother finally finds the aisle with the breadcrumb choices. I was getting frustrated walking around and around the store. But my grandmother shows me options. There\\u2019s one with mushrooms, which I say no to because of my sister\\u2019s allergy. Another is made of potato chips and I think that could be interesting, so it\\u2019s a maybe. There\\u2019s another one with some other flavors in a big pink bag. None are exactly right, but I have to choose something and stand in line again to purchase it. In another scene, there is a group of men, mostly African American. They are setting up a nice area for themselves with a firepit, matching tables and chairs. They\\u2019ve created something beautiful. We are all sitting around outside in the dark around separate fire pits. Most of us are striving to get by and have mismatched sets of chairs and such.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Anya, Moira, Kel, and a new patient who I haven\\u2019t met yet. The office is down the street from a big house that is being used for multiple offices. I\\u2019m in the house. Anya and Kel are helping me set up the tables upstairs. People are arriving for sessions. A fire is lit in the fireplace. It\\u2019s dark and musty. There are quite a few massage and chiropractic tables folded in their traveling bags. There are tables and stacked chairs. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to set up the table for privacy and professionalism for my new patient, but it\\u2019s chaotic. This is a way for me to practice and for people to watch me work and potentially become patients.\"],[\"I can only remember two bits from an extensive dream. I\\u2019m walking down a city street. There are steps leading up to a second story restaurant. It\\u2019s an elegant cafe. I go up the stairs with my son. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I\\u2019m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we\\u2019ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I\\u2019ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he\\u2019s gone. He\\u2019s not on the stairs. I\\u2019m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s gone. In another scene, I\\u2019m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I\\u2019m at the baths. I\\u2019m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She\\u2019s watching the cat while the cat\\u2019s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I\\u2019m trying to pretend that I don\\u2019t know Ursula so that the woman doesn\\u2019t connect me with Ursula\\u2019s former apprentice.\"],[\"I accept Garth\\u2019s invitation to come and visit. He is staying in a multi level apartment building. I go by myself and knock on his door. His wife and daughter aren\\u2019t there, they just had a really big fight and his wife has left with their daughter. He invites me to sit down on the couch so I can do my work. I have my laptop. I sit on a fluffy green couch. He has all the ergonomic things and is handing me something to hold the computer and another thing to cancel the EMF and another thing to support my neck. He\\u2019s being attentive to me in all those ways. He invites me to put the computer down and sit next to him. I think about it for a while, then I do. He draws me closer to him. I pull back because I don\\u2019t want to betray her friendship. I want to open a conversation about their relationship to see if there's anything I can do to help mend the wounds. I know that cuddling him and giving him physical comfort wouldn\\u2019t be good for any of our relationships.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the bathroom with a couple other women. We are getting ready. They\\u2019re in and out of the shower. One woman is really fit and looks like she does yoga regularly. She is jumping up and down and dancing in the bathtub as she\\u2019s showering. She says she uses every opportunity to move her body. There\\u2019s something waiting outside the bathroom. It feels ritualistic and dark, involving blood, but I can\\u2019t recall anything more.\"],[\"Somehow I\\u2019m able to see the priestess message board and the communications that are occuring, written in gold filigree on a black background. I can see the names of the current priestesses and little gold fairies and the teachings being recorded here. I don\\u2019t know if they can tell I\\u2019m here observing. Ursula looks up as if she knows I\\u2019m here and I\\u2019m wondering if my name is appearing on the board as someone present and watching. The messages begin to disappear. The names are changed. I can\\u2019t understand them any longer. But I know one is her daughter and she is the \\u201cseanalair\\u201d or the \\u201cseantian.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a street, it\\u2019s dark and wet, like it\\u2019s been raining all day. It\\u2019s not currently raining. I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called \\u201cKali\\u2019s Eyes.\\u201d I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn\\u2019t functioning well and I can\\u2019t find what I\\u2019m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I\\u2019ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it\\u2019s really crowded. I\\u2019m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they\\u2019ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can\\u2019t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I\\u2019m frustrated. It\\u2019s also still COVID, so it\\u2019s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that\\u2019s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I\\u2019d like to sit on, but they\\u2019ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it\\u2019s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It\\u2019s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They\\u2019re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other\\u2019s faces, so it\\u2019s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It\\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\\u2019t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night, after hours, and I\\u2019m at the coffee shop - next door and outside. There are bins of spices. The owner of the coffee shop who I know socially is pouring the spices from the containers he used during the day and into the larger bulk bins. I see he accidentally mixes the salt and cayenne, pouring the salt into the cayenne bin and the cayenne into the salt bin. He\\u2019s distracted. He doesn\\u2019t realize what he\\u2019s doing in the moment. He realizes that I\\u2019m there and then notices his mistake and realizes he ruined the salt and cayenne and they\\u2019re basically unusable. Jeremy is here now. They are both implicating me and saying that I caused him to make this mistake and brought an evil omen.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at the table with my bodywork teacher and people who are new to his work and paying for continuing education. He invites me to stay, listen and learn again anything I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m giving a session to Gemma outside in a courtyard. There\\u2019s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He\\u2019s good friends with Gemma, maybe they\\u2019re lovers. I\\u2019m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she\\u2019s going to the dinner later. I\\u2019m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, \\u201cThank you, that was really great.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting feedback but there isn\\u2019t time. Some other things happen and it\\u2019s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can\\u2019t come in because he\\u2019s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It\\u2019s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I\\u2019m not quite sure what they are because they\\u2019ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn\\u2019t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn\\u2019t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they\\u2019re much larger than me. I\\u2019m either really far away or I\\u2019ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I\\u2019m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It\\u2019s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It\\u2019s an ornate room with wood floors. There\\u2019s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they\\u2019re going to trap me, I\\u2019ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month\\u2019s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I\\u2019m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it\\u2019s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn\\u2019t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji\\u2019s ashram comes in and she\\u2019s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I\\u2019m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn\\u2019t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019ve been banished and will never be able to return. You\\u2019re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.\\u201d She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.\\u201d She laughs. I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don\\u2019t realize that I\\u2019m the one who took the entire community\\u2019s water.\"],[\"I\\u2019m supposed to co-teach a yoga class with Les. People have arrived at the hotel. I\\u2019m there and walking around the room talking to the students. Then I realize I\\u2019m wearing a short white cotton dress. The room is heating up for class. I realize I\\u2019ll sweat and this dress will be transparent and I won\\u2019t be able to demo in it. I look up at the clock and see that I have just enough time to slip over to the boutique and pick up some yoga clothes. When I get there, the people are really helpful. They give me a bodysuit. I slip it on but it doesn\\u2019t look good at all. It\\u2019s taking a lot more time than I expected and there aren\\u2019t many other appropriate options for my body or teaching. Then I find a little pair of stretchy corduroy shorts and a top. I pull them on and think it will do. I go back and when I get back, the class is almost over and I\\u2019ve missed the whole thing while I was trying to find appropriate clothes to teach in.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving down on a mountain road. There are alpacas sitting on the side and people have set up camps in the forests. I\\u2019m looking for a place to hunker down for the night. I drive all the way to the top and then back down. I stop near a sweet family of alpacas, or maybe they\\u2019re llamas because they\\u2019re bigger. The mama llama has her babies tucked in close to her body. As I\\u2019m admiring them, somebody comes down after me. They\\u2019re yelling at me and accusing me of killing the alpacas up higher on the road. Someone says, \\u201cNo, she loves alpacas.\\u201d I\\u2019m bewildered because I\\u2019m brand new to this place and I\\u2019ve never seen these people. Jules comes down and says I can stay in the loft. I go into this cute wooden cottage. There\\u2019s a bed and I can tell people come and go from this place a lot. It\\u2019s a spot for travelers and friends. I settle in a little then go back down to join the others.\"],[\"There is a dance ritual to perform tonight. I\\u2019m up high on a mountain with a flat area, like a plateau with sheer cliffs rather than a mountain peak. Some structures have been built up here. The ritual is for the sun. i don\\u2019t know if the sun is setting or rising. It\\u2019s very dark. All I see at the horizon is an orange ball of light. There\\u2019s a change of plans. Now the ritual is happening in the pool. There are a lot of people. The only one I recognize is a mama friend. We talk on the steps leading into the pool. I don\\u2019t recall anything about the conversation or the ritual. I\\u2019m talking with Mary about human origins. She says something about the latest research and the shape of your legs. She says she can tell me about my origin by holding my breasts in her hands to weigh them and get a sense of them and me. I agree and shift my shirt and bra to the side. She does so. She says, \\u201cOh you are a brigar peggis mortae.\\u201d She steps back and points to these flanks hanging up on hooks. They\\u2019re samples of different species. She points to the one that is my origin. I can see that each of the forms have differently shaped acetabuli. I think, \\u201cOh! This shape is why I never could be a professional ballerina.\\u201d I see other shapes that would have allowed me a better turnout for ballet.\"],[\"We\\u2019re setting up for a day at the office, my husband and I. There are suddenly so many people. My husband has six or ten tables set up in a row and every table has a person lying on it. I have my four tables at the end set up perpendicular to his. The tables are really close together so I go to help him rearrange the tables, staggering them by pulling one forward and the next bag. The people stay on the tables while we\\u2019re doing this. Then I lie down on a table so he can check me before I start my day. It takes a really long time for him to get to me. By the time he takes care of me and I go to my people, two of the four are gone. They got frustrated with waiting and I can see why - it\\u2019s been about forty minutes and I\\u2019m running late. I work on the two people remaining then leave to go find the other two. One is in a building next door, it\\u2019s like a mall. She\\u2019s shopping for meditation cushions and some new clothes. We talk and things are okay between us - she just needed to run some errands, but she\\u2019ll come back. She tells me how she has a scholarship to study and they\\u2019re providing room and board for free. She\\u2019ll be staying at the tents. Whoever they are, they are extremely wealthy and they\\u2019re idea of camping is extremely nice. She shows me the camping setup. It\\u2019s a tall and long domed structure made of clay. The beds are set up on a long loft that goes across the entire length of the structure, and they\\u2019re actual beds, not sleeping bags. It\\u2019s warm, too. After the tour, we go down to the bottom floor. As we\\u2019re walking out, a whale is nudging her face through the doorway. Somehow, the structure has been built over deep water. So the whale is pushing her head out and agitating an elephant standing just at the other side of the threshold. I look up and see Kundry sitting atop the elephant. The elephant brings down her head and her trunk gets entangled with the whale. It\\u2019s hard to tell if they\\u2019re in conflict or greeting each other. Kundry is taken down and they get all twisted together. There\\u2019s another large grey animal getting involved, but I can\\u2019t tell what it is.\"],[\"There are four separate interrelated scenes - a really nice apartment condo by the ocean; a little Cobb style house that once belonged to Jeremy; a lovely home and office built around a tree at a retreat center; and a hospital in Hawaii. I am moving into a really nice condo. It\\u2019s modern with new appliances, white walls, high ceilings, big floor to ceiling windows with a view of the ocean from every room. The ocean is choppy and dark, but beautiful. I\\u2019ve never been to New England but it seems like the Atlantic ocean of the northeastern United States. The rent is extremely affordable and I\\u2019m wondering why. I\\u2019m living with a childhood friend (we really only knew each other when I was an infant and he was five) and another woman who comes and goes. We are learning how to live with each other, learning each other\\u2019s rhythms with cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and working. The refrigerator is full of delicious food - produce and prepared meals. I go to see where he is. He\\u2019s napping on a couch with a book across his chest. He has his head towards me then he senses that I\\u2019m there on the couch and he turns his body so his feet are towards me. His knees are open and I feel a warmth and desire awaken in my body. I crawl up towards him and it surprises us both even though there has been an attraction between our souls since the beginning of my life. We go into the kitchen and there is a tentative quality to our interaction now, feeling each other out and this new expression of our relationship. I wrap my legs around him and kiss him. Then for a moment he switches to my dad then switches back. That was weird. But there is a beautiful connection and fluidity in the way we are together. It\\u2019s as if we were made to be together, but waking life circumstances didn\\u2019t work in our favor. Then I learn that the reason this condo is so affordable is because there are cameras everywhere set to film us making love. It\\u2019s like a pornography studio. I don\\u2019t really know what to make of it. But I love being here at the ocean and with him, so it\\u2019s okay. Then, the dream shifts. I am walking by a little Cobb style cottage that was for sale, but now it looks like someone has recently bought it and moved in. I think this house once belonged to Jeremy and Zoe. It\\u2019s really crafty. There are waves carved over the mantel and the front door. It\\u2019s tan and brown, really of the earth. There\\u2019s a wooden fence all around and a little garden. Inside, a fire is burning in the fireplace. Herbs are hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is warm and carved of wood. Everything is just enough and just right. No one is home. I go in through the door in the back and am walking around, curious to see if it feels like home to me. In a way, it does. I make a cup of tea and sit in front of the fire. Then I get a sense that whoever lives here will be returning home soon, so I need to make it look like I wasn\\u2019t there, moving things back and covering up my presence. I leave and walk around the corner past the front. This is when I see this symbolic spiral wave over the front door and I can see through the door and walls to how the design over the mantel is a continuation of this design. I walk away into another scene. I\\u2019m with my mom, dad and sister. We are touring a gorgeous place with a real estate agent. It\\u2019s a home modeled around a huge tree. It\\u2019s built in the round, like a spiral. There\\u2019s a lovely glass sunroom that wraps nearly all around and a deck around that. When you walk in, there\\u2019s the tree trunk, a fireplace and a sitting area with long curving couches designed for this space. A doorway leads to a spacious bedroom which I don\\u2019t go into yet. The home spirals to the right to a beautiful kitchen with an island. It\\u2019s a community kitchen with a pantry stocked full. It continues into a laundry room and a room for the cats. As we are in the kitchen, another group comes in and goes upstairs. The real estate is angry because we now know how public this home is - anyone who lives at the retreat center has full access to this kitchen and to the offices upstairs. There is a recording studio and office with computers and printer upstairs. It is quite loud and we realize it won\\u2019t be a private home. We are still interested though. She shows us through the laundry room to the glass sunroom and cat walk that spirals around the front. It\\u2019s warm and bright and there is a cat lounging in the sun. I love it. She takes us upstairs to this beautiful office. Everything is furnished and lovely. We go back downstairs and into the spacious bedroom. I realize this is an apartment in and of itself. It\\u2019s big and open. There\\u2019s a fireplace where you can roast potatoes in the ashes. There are old fashioned iron stovetops with terracotta pots set on top to radiate warmth into the space. They are cooking a feast of roasted chickens and breads and other kinds of meat and vegetables. It smells so good. I tell my dad, \\u201cHow wonderful would it be to learn how to use these stoves and cook these gorgeous meals?!\\u201d I go down one step to look at the bedroom to see if it will be good for my husband, son and me. There\\u2019s a huge bed. The room feels spacious and it\\u2019s flooded with sunlight. I love it. On the far side of the bedroom is something like a clear plastic tent tarp. Through it I see seven beds lined up against the wall. They are covered with colorful pillows and it\\u2019s so bright and inviting. There\\u2019s a paper with instructions for how to set up the pillows so they all fit. I think how wonderful it would be to invite friends over. I want to negotiate with the realtor about renting just this part of the treehouse, not the whole place. She won\\u2019t get as much of a commission as she wanted, but maybe she\\u2019ll be happy to have something rather than nothing. As we are leaving, we are putting on our shoes on the deck just outside the front door. My dad is trying to be funny. We have the same kind of shoes - brown plastic slippers. He\\u2019s trying to put on one of my shoes but it of course doesn\\u2019t fit. I tell him to give me back my shoe. Then I\\u2019m in a hospital in Hawaii. I\\u2019m partially in a room with a curtain and partially outside. My best friend from middle school is giving birth. They are torturing her, pushing on her stomach, squeezing and twisting. She\\u2019s in so much pain. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do it that way! You\\u2019re hurting her and the baby!\\u201d I think the baby is dead inside her. She\\u2019s exhausted. I\\u2019m also pregnant and giving birth. I won\\u2019t let anyone touch me. I feel my own stomach and the baby\\u2019s head is down and to the left and okay. I\\u2019m watching people rush around because this is an emergency room. A friend from college, is the doctor. I ask him to check me because I think I can trust him not to harm me or my baby. He approaches me tentatively. He is still unsure of himself around me because I rejected him so many years ago. He has a butter knife with what looks like raw ground beef on it. He puts a towel over me and checks. He brings the knife up and there is blood dripping from it onto his nose. There\\u2019s a look in his eyes like, \\u201cThis could have been my baby.\\u201d He is sad about the loss of our friendship and his desire to be in relationship. The labor is continuing and getting stronger. I look out into the city scene. It\\u2019s mostly grey and full of the sounds of a busy city. Through the grey I see bright red and yellow, the colors of Hawaiian royalty. The Hawaiians have joined together with their drums and are playing the rhythm of life, birth and death. I drum along with them on my belly as if my tummy is an ipu. I see one man stand up above the rest with his drum and he\\u2019s so full of vitality and passion. The passion and rhythm are in such contrast to the city, but this is what I tune into - the red and yellow and drums.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a big theater, like where they host the Grammys. Every seat is occupied. I\\u2019m sitting near the front at the far left with a small group of people, including JP Spears the comedian with a YouTube channel who has swung pretty disturbingly really far left, borderline Q. I don't\\u2019 recognize anyone else in my group from waking life. He\\u2019s put together a routine for us to perform with him. I\\u2019m his assistant. He is telling me about the routine where he\\u2019ll make someone float and make them appear to be him. The person he points out is a young girl with long red hair like him. She is unconscious or asleep. We go up the stairs to the stage and he places her on a table. He tosses a blue blanket over her naked body. I\\u2019m concerned for her modesty and adjust the blanket as he begins the show. He begins the act and somehow he raises her from the table so she\\u2019s floating in the air. This is supposed to be the peak of the performance. There was another part where he made other images of himself, one where he is an older version of himself with a bulbous nose and greying hair. At the end of the routine there isn\\u2019t a lot of applause and we all return to our seats. Other presentations continue on the stage. JP Spears is now lying across the top of the seats in front of me. There is a guy sitting to my right who was somewhat attractive. It looks and sounds like they are masturbating each other. They are breathing heavily. It\\u2019s disturbing and disgusting. I lean in a bit to see if they\\u2019re actually doing what I think they\\u2019re doing. JP Spears cums in my face and I\\u2019m utterly disgusted now. It gets in my eye and mouth. I get up and leave right away. I\\u2019m deciding what to do and where to go now. I don\\u2019t know who to report them to, or if I should. I\\u2019m outside the theatre. It\\u2019s dark and raining. I\\u2019m trying to find a car to get back home. I don\\u2019t have a home here in this place. So I\\u2019m trying to figure out where to go. Later in the dream I am in a house that I\\u2019m sharing with my sister and a woman from my current hometown - she and I do the same kind of work, and we\\u2019re sharing a room. My sister has her own room. I can\\u2019t fall asleep so I get up and wander around the house. The house is a mess with partially unpacked boxes and piles of clothes everywhere. I feel bad about this chaos and how sloppy I am. I just don\\u2019t have the energy to put the house in order and it\\u2019s also nighttime. She is awake reading, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a good idea to make a bunch of noise trying to clean up. I walk past the kitchen and my parents walk in through the door. They are returning early from a trip to the Big Island. They had plans to go on island tours and enjoy the island. They were at dinner and a Senator approached them and told them it was pleasant to see them, but with COVID still actively spreading, they should go home. This is not the time for vacationing. They tell me they were able to catch an early flight. My mom has brought my sister and me some new clothes and jewelry. She has laid out an outfit on the ground - a Christmas sweater that lights up and belonged to my grandmother, jeggings and a gold necklace. My dad has set out guacamole and tortillas for a midnight snack. I eat it and feel better. I get a call from Edward to prepare for a Zoom meeting with a woman who has been working with us. He wants me to find the contract so he can graciously thank her for her help, knowing exactly when she started working with us. I am looking through emails to find the contract but am not sure if that was the exact start date. The first email introduction was sent on October 24. We get on Zoom and she\\u2019s calling in from a kids pool. She\\u2019s on a playdate with her grandchildren and some others. She has her feet in the water with them and they\\u2019re all having a wonderful time splashing and playing on the slides.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s raining. I\\u2019m in a city, a rough part of the city. There\\u2019s a woman standing next to her pickup truck. Somebody is watching her. Actually several people are watching her because I see her and a sinister person sees her from the shadows and another person calls her. The person on the phone is watching out for people and giving them a safe place to hide where they will be protected. So she gets a call on her cell phone from an anonymous person. Somehow I can hear the call and it\\u2019s a voice I recognize from earlier in the dream. This is the voice that leads people to the safe haven. They flash coordinates for the woman to follow so she can get to the haven. She puts the phone down and gets into her truck and takes off, really fast. I\\u2019m following her and can\\u2019t tell if she\\u2019s going to continue across the bridge or not. She turns left right before the bridge behind an old building and into a construction site. When you look carefully, this construction site is actually a playground for kids. There are bridges and climbing apparatuses all made of car parts and such. I\\u2019m following because I\\u2019ve wanted to find this place for a long time but have never had the actual coordinates. I hope that the sinister person that was tracking her and others isn\\u2019t fast enough to find her. Now I\\u2019m somehow in the safe house. There\\u2019s a swamp all around it. People that I dip with in the river. We\\u2019re all in the kitchen and people are coming and going. I think I\\u2019m getting ready to leave on a mission. There\\u2019s a pie in the drawer and I have a piece but it\\u2019s so good that I eat more. My son has a piece and my husband eats a bigger piece. It\\u2019s all gone now and I feel a little bad that we\\u2019ve eaten it all. Now I\\u2019m helping fold a tablecloth which looks more like an altar cloth. I can see all the pleats where it was folded tightly and neatly to fit into a small bag. I\\u2019m unable to fold it that well and instead fold it like I would a sheet. It won\\u2019t fit back into its bag, though. More people come in and are eating around the table and socializing and arranging to go out again in small groups.\"],[\"I\\u2019m trying to record a meditation or yoga video. I\\u2019m setting up my space and the camera, trying different locations and viewpoints. I need to set the camera at an angle so it doesn\\u2019t highlight my scoliosis because I think it would be a distraction. I set myself kind of under the staircase. I get a good frame but then realize my son\\u2019s Mickey Mouse car is in the frame and I have to rearrange the space again. It\\u2019s frustrating and I\\u2019m running out of time. I\\u2019m wondering where else I could do this, but anywhere else would have distracting background noises. I just want to get this done and move on. Earlier in the dream, there\\u2019s a show that we are preparing. We are a random group of people and I don\\u2019t recognize any of them. We haven\\u2019t rehearsed together, but are now suddenly being pulled together for this performance piece. I\\u2019m getting ready and a few women are helping me with my makeup. I need to choose a foundation and am asking them for their recommendation. One might be a bit too brown, but they say the pink one is nice and youthful. These women are very good with makeup and skilled in its application. I\\u2019m not so skilled with this particular art, but am grateful for their help. A woman is here and she is stealing everybody\\u2019s intellectual property by observing and copying their performances exactly. She\\u2019s stolen away and we have to find her and be sure she doesn\\u2019t succeed. All I have as clues is that she is wearing pale silk fabrics.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, everybody is stuck repeating their same dream over and over and over again. This is the thirteenth night. We\\u2019re all having our own dreams, but they overlap in places where we have encounters with each other. The main place where my dream overlaps and encounters others\\u2019 is at a really small airport. The main person, the dream is interacting with is Rose and people from her dreams. Each time this interaction of dreams happens, there is an opportunity to figure out why the repetition is happening. Between the two of us, we have a chance to interrupt the continued repetitions and be free. This time around, Rose shows up while I\\u2019m waiting in line for my ticket. She\\u2019s wearing fitness clothes for pole dancing - little shorts and a tank top. She has a workout bag full of clothes and toiletries. She\\u2019s waiting for a plane, but so far in all the dreams the plane has never come. I\\u2019m in this airport also waiting for a plane or maybe a train. It's dingy in here and there aren\\u2019t any windows. There\\u2019s a round table that reminds me of the ones at my high school cafeteria. There is stale coffee in styrofoam cups and the wooden sticks to stir in fake sure and half and half, but no food. We\\u2019re all waiting in line for our tickets then going back to the table to wait more. One of the owners of the pole dancing studio shows up with her husband. She\\u2019s wearing a grey sweatsuit, but still looks sexy with her hair and makeup done just right. I feel self conscious and awkward because I recognize her but am not sure if she recognizes me or if she does, if she remembers my name. This happens to me in waking life because I have a good memory for people\\u2019s faces and names, but there are people who I must introduce myself to time and time again because they seem to have no memory of me. She and Rose and a few others are sitting together at one of the tables. It\\u2019s grimy because it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned well in a long time. There\\u2019s trash on the floor and the trashcan nearby is overflowing. Rose gets up and goes to the bathroom to change. She comes out in a black tank top, black pole dancing shorts and black heels. She\\u2019s extra tall. I\\u2019m walking next to her and feel short and frumpy because she is over six feet in her heels and lean, where I am short and deconditioned. We walk to a shower room that\\u2019s like a truck stop shower. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cViviane, we\\u2019ve gotta figure out how to get out of here. Tell me what this dream sequence means.\\u201d She thinks that if we can find out what it means, we will be free. I can\\u2019t recall what happens, though I know we are discussing the dreams.\"],[\"I was heading in to teach several thousand people. There\\u2019s this huge room and all these people are piling in and it was almost an anxiety dream about teaching.\"],[\"This morning I was dreaming about my daughter and then I feel like I was dreaming about Meghan Markle, but I can\\u2019t remember what.\"],[\"I had a dream that someone came to clean my sink. They opened up the sink and it went down, down, down - all the way down like 1 or 2 stories. I was like, \\u201cHow is the sink filling if it\\u2019s that low down there?\\u201d He had a spiral thing and got all the hair and gunk out. Then he made it crystal clean and perfect. He put the stuff back.\"],[\"I dreamed of Brad Pitt.\"],[\"In the dream, I\\u2019m walking with Sabrina. She\\u2019s actually nice and normal, not malevolent or dark. I remember thinking in the dream that maybe this is her core energy that is covered by everything else. Or maybe this was before something happened? She asks me if I can dance ballet. I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t do pointe, but I can dance some.\\u201d Then she wants me to dance or show her. So I start to do ballet. I leap into the air and as I leap, I start to fly. I start flying up in the air in circles, dancing around her. She\\u2019s below and is amazed. There are other people below me, looking at me and are like, \\u201cWow!\\u201d At a certain point, I realize Sabrina can\\u2019t fly. Then I realize the things I can do that she can\\u2019t do, which has been a theme in a few of the dreams with her, even the dark ones - I can meet her power and am even more powerful than she is. I\\u2019m struck by that in the dream. At a certain point, I\\u2019m dancing and flying, then the air of the Holy Spirit goes into me through my yoni. I realize I\\u2019m being made love to by the Universe, by God, by Spirit. Then I become filled with the Holy Spirit and impregnated.\"],[\"I dreamt of Keanu Reeves again.\"],[\"This dream was about Trump (I\\u2019ve never dreamt of Trump before). In the dream, I\\u2019m in a top apartment or maybe a nice hotel or maybe a really nice attic apartment. I\\u2019m at the top of something. I\\u2019m sealing everything up. I\\u2019m closing the doors, I\\u2019m taping the windows, I\\u2019m taping the cracks. I\\u2019m sealing everything up because something really bad is about to happen and it\\u2019s connected to Trump. I\\u2019m assuming it\\u2019s toxic or poisonous or something.

I can\\u2019t remember the specifics. In another scene, I see a huge tidal wave - 100 feet and right there I have my daughter with me and I grab her hand and say, \\u201cCome with me!\\u201d I pull her into this giant building that we just happened to be walking by - a really tall, huge building. I pul us in and lose the door and it secures. We just make it as this wave goes by. I notice when we\\u2019re in there that there are no windows and I guess this is why we were safe. It may have been a gymnasium, all concrete with no windows and huge. I\\u2019m not sure if anyone else was in there. It\\u2019s possible there were a few others, though. It was definitely not a full building. I feel like when I pulled her in, I ran her up some stairs so we could go up a few levels, but it\\u2019s vague. We are in the right place at the right time for having just walked by this building when this tidal wave was coming. If we were anywhere else we would have been caught in it. Towards the end I\\u2019m like, okay, when we walk out, everybody will have died. There\\u2019s no way anyone survived that. We hadn\\u2019t gone back out yet, I was just bracing myself for going out to see what happened.\"],[\"There are underground labyrinth subterranean pools. They are dark and kind of dirty looking, almost like a sewer. People would go in them and get lost and never come out. They were hidden everywhere. They\\u2019d come out everywhere. You could just be walking in the city, then there's this place hidden in plain sight and it\\u2019s a portal into these subterranean chambers and also coming back out. They\\u2019re hidden, but if I lift something up, I can see them. But they don\\u2019t look like they should be lifted. You have to know to lift it to see what\\u2019s underneath. Then there\\u2019s a tunnel or some kind of portal into the labyrinth. When I see the hidden places, I can't just go lift up the top, I have to ask the teacher. There\\u2019s some person in there. People aren\\u2019t supposed to touch these things. But I\\u2019m not in a class, so I don\\u2019t understand that. At one point I see one and I lift it without asking. I almost get in trouble. I finally found the end of it where all of them go to or come from. It\\u2019s like a giant hot tub. I pulled open the top and it was steaming and swirling but also dirty looking, almost like a sewer. I could not figure out how people go in there and then almost had to swim under to then find the space to pop up in. It just looked really gross and I couldn\\u2019t figure out how people breathed in it. At one point, the teacher or leader says something about me as I\\u2019m walking away - I think it\\u2019s when I apologized for opening one of them without asking and they were like, oh it\\u2019s okay okay.

They\\u2019re following you.\\u201d It was like a lightbulb went on my brain: Oh, I\\u2019m being followed because of my light and tracked by these darker energies. It was almost like what you\\u2019d imagine if someone is being followed by spies or the CIA. At one point, I\\u2019m in my house and locking all the doors to make sure no one can get in. At a certain point, Tom Hanks is there and he\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve never dreamt of him before. He\\u2019s being creepy, but I\\u2019m being naive and nice, thinking he\\u2019s just nice. We must be at a hotel pool because I\\u2019m lying somewhere reading a book and relaxing. I realize I don\\u2019t do this a lot because I work so much. Tom Hanks is there and he\\u2019s really close to me. He comments on the book I\\u2019m reading: \\u201cOh you\\u2019ve been reading that book for a while.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, you know, I\\u2019m just relaxing.\\u201d Later on I wonder how he knows I\\u2019ve been reading this book for a while? Then he starts to touch my neck I\\u2019m really weirded out and am like, \\u201cStop, stop, stop.\\u201d It wakes me up. As I wake up, I make this really weird noise with my throat, like a choking guttural noise. I have a weird energy waking up from this dream and making that sound. There were other parts of the dream where I remember being in the rafters of a giant building and I\\u2019m hiding from these bad guys. I can fly between buildings.\"],[\"\\u201cDriving with Bernard\\u201d I was visiting Bernard and Carol. I park in their garage. I had recently gotten my hair cut or trimmed again - I had just chopped it. The person that cut it, cut it wrong and cut it too close and it looked disgusting. There are ravens and crows in Bernard\\u2019s garage. I've been with them a long time and it\\u2019s late, so he drives me home. But he\\u2019s tired. I forgot that my car is in their garage. He seems slightly annoyed that it\\u2019s late and he\\u2019s having to drive. He drives on the walls! I freak out and ask him if Carol is okay with this. He\\u2019s driving more like a skateboarder kid, so he\\u2019s going straight, then he\\u2019s going up on the wall and going down and then going up again. He\\u2019s acting kind of like a child. Then he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes. But it\\u2019s not a major crash. He just lightly hits a wall. I end up having to call for help. Carol is worried. I end up bringing him home. I have to take him upstairs. Then I get in my own car and leave. At some point, I see a silver french bulldog that I used to own in dreamtime, but rehomed it. I keep thinking about getting a dog, but we had a dog once and we rehomed him because he was the neediest dog ever and competing with my daughter for my attention, but the whole point of getting this dog was so that he and my daughter could bond. So I rehomed him. I used to have this french bulldog in the dream, but was like, \\u201cOh, I got rid of it.\\u201d\"],[\"I dreamt of this guy who showed up in my dreams as an animus figure. He used to show up as a new animus figure, a healthy, good, kind, integrated masculine. But then he shifted into a wounded masculine figure. He\\u2019s there in the dream and he\\u2019s into me and I\\u2019m hanging out with him. At a certain point, he is going to kiss me then he pulls away. I end up kissing him. Then I think to myself, \\u201cI\\u2019m being the masculine here.\\u201d His mouth is limp. It\\u2019s weird. His roommates tell me he is like a child and they always have to pick up after him and he\\u2019s really immature.\"],[\"I had a dream of my friend Havilah in a beautiful landscape that reminded me of Panther Meadows.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to get two cats that I had dropped off. But when we get them, they\\u2019re adolescent tigers. They\\u2019re nuzzling each other. We\\u2019re petting them and they\\u2019re playful. I\\u2019m surprised that they\\u2019re tigers now. Then I see our old dog who we rehomed years ago because he needed a different situation, but then he ended up dying. He\\u2019s old and blind and bleeding. I grab him to rehabilitate him. He looks very sad.\"],[\"A dream of shoes and shoe boxes. There\\u2019s a white shoe with a heel, like a wedding shoe for some lady. There are lots of shoes, pairing up. I\\u2019m trying to find shoes that fit me and my daughter. Then I realize I\\u2019ll probably just donate the rest to the homeless.\"],[\"I had a weird dream. I was at an Anaiya Sophia ritual. There\\u2019s water in the fridge in a silver carafe. It\\u2019s salty and leaking all over. I use her bath towels to clean it out. During the ritual, a helicopter is spraying the water but runs out of water. I go to a room and open the door. A man and a child are in a bathtub. I see him at a pool. There are women like snakes and things on the floor in Anaiya Sophia\\u2019s bathroom.\"],[\"I saw a big pink church, a school on a hill. As I take a picture, a voice says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ego-maniichal church.\\u201d It was like a big really expensive church up on a mountain like in Malibu.\"],[\"I was booking flights somewhere abroad, maybe Europe or Egypt, in that direction. I was realizing that we were going to get free or really discounted business class upgrades. I was really excited to be traveling again.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of \\u201chouse,\\u201d but I can\\u2019t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we\\u2019re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can\\u2019t live on Gaia anymore and it\\u2019s not worth the effort to try to save her. She\\u2019s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.\"],[\"There are just snippets of this dream that came through. I\\u2019m in the kitchen of my childhood home trying to put dishes away and reorganize the cabinet. My sister\\u2019s there with me. She\\u2019s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she\\u2019s always playing the victim. Then I\\u2019m in a house - it\\u2019s close by my childhood home. There\\u2019s a man living in it who\\u2019s apparently my significant other, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There\\u2019s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he\\u2019s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I\\u2019m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I\\u2019m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There\\u2019s an opera house. It\\u2019s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I\\u2019m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I\\u2019m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There\\u2019s all kinds of magical things in them. It\\u2019s dark up in here and I\\u2019m looking through them. Then I decide it\\u2019s time to leave. Now I\\u2019m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I\\u2019m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There\\u2019s so much snow and I\\u2019m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I\\u2019m driving down, there\\u2019s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn\\u2019t I stop to let them go by, don\\u2019t I know that pedestrians have the right of way. I look at them and I look ahead of me where there\\u2019s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It\\u2019s a small street, I\\u2019m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my ex again (this is the second night in a row). There is tension between the two of us. He says he\\u2019s moving and wants to take some of the furniture. We\\u2019re standing in the kid\\u2019s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it\\u2019s very dark in there. I see that there\\u2019s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don\\u2019t care if he takes them. There\\u2019s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I\\u2019m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I\\u2019m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I\\u2019m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I\\u2019m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I\\u2019m still a mother. I still have two children. They\\u2019re still with me. And my godmother says let\\u2019s just go. All of a sudden we\\u2019re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I\\u2019m starting to get upset because I realize we didn\\u2019t pack anything. There\\u2019s no food. There\\u2019s no water. I don\\u2019t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don\\u2019t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I\\u2019m sure. I say, \\u201cyes, we don\\u2019t have any of the things we need.\\u201d She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there\\u2019s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we\\u2019re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we\\u2019re heading back the other way. We\\u2019re all fine, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, \\u201c well, we\\u2019re going to take a shortcut.\\u201d And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He\\u2019s young - he\\u2019s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He\\u2019s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There\\u2019s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there\\u2019s display cases and a buffet table. I\\u2019m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don\\u2019t because I\\u2019m allergic to rice and I\\u2019m allergic to soy and I can\\u2019t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I\\u2019m heartbroken because number one, I\\u2019m starving, and number two, I haven\\u2019t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m traveling in a car with all my siblings - it\\u2019s a van so we can all fit. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. We seem to be having an okay time. The scene changes really suddenly and there\\u2019s an impression that a lot of time has passed - weeks, months, perhaps. I\\u2019m really confused and don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019ve gotten to where I am. I feel like I\\u2019m waking up or seeing things that are really new and strange for me. My mom is there and she tells me that the car I had been traveling had crashed. My dad had been driving it and the accident was pretty bad. Everything is okay now. My body is fine. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with me. It seems so strange that there could have been an accident and I don\\u2019t remember it at all. She tells me it was pretty bad. I have no idea if my siblings or dad made it because it\\u2019s just me and my mom. The scene changes again and I\\u2019m with a bunch of friends from high school and some friends from now. We\\u2019re in a basement of a building. It has a huge storage unit and has all kinds of things in it from older times but also feels like a theatre costume room. We\\u2019re searching for a very specific item for one of my friends. As we go through all this stuff, it seems kind of weird - all these random bits of fabric and buttons. But we\\u2019re not finding what we\\u2019re looking for. Then the scene changes again. I\\u2019m on a soccer field and I\\u2019m really wanting to play, but I have these white shoes I need to put on and it\\u2019s taking me forever to put the shoes on and the laces are really long. My friend who is also a masseuse is there as well. He\\u2019s playing soccer and he\\u2019s playing really well. I want to go and play, but I also feel like maybe I\\u2019m not good enough and maybe that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s taking me so long to put my shoes on. Although he does keep trying to pass me the ball, but I\\u2019m still on the sidelines. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m not allowed to be on the team. It\\u2019s a full size field and a full size ball, then it suddenly switches to a very small room. We\\u2019re all still trying to fit in and play soccer, and the ball has shrunk down to about the size of a softball and it\\u2019s yellow. My friend keeps trying to pass the ball to me and I keep missing. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019ve never played soccer before. Then I get tired of it because I feel like I really can\\u2019t play and I can\\u2019t get these shoes on. All of my high school friends are still around and one of them is in a bed. I go sit on the bed and talk with her. Then a bunch of others come. They\\u2019re talking about all these adventures they\\u2019ve gone and are going to go on, and all these places they\\u2019ve seen around the world. I\\u2019m sitting there feeling frustrated because I\\u2019ve not done any of that - in my whole life, I\\u2019ve not gone to have a vacation in Costa Rica or Belize and they\\u2019re telling these fantastical stories of when they\\u2019ve gone. They\\u2019re also very chummy, but I feel like the outsider - definitely outsider vibes. Then the scene shifts a little bit, and while there\\u2019s still this big bed that we\\u2019ve all congregated on, now they\\u2019re talking about Brad Pitt and another actor from way back in the day. They\\u2019re talking about how Brad Pitt keeps saying that he could date any woman he wanted, but oddly enough, he\\u2019s still single and nobody really wants to date him and how he just brags all the time. Then we\\u2019re talking about Jennifer Lopez and how she has so much money because she bought an open market in France and charges a commission for each store that is there in the market and so she just makes this passive income forever and ever. Even magazines have commented on how she has this structure and foundation so she doesn\\u2019t have to rely on the work she puts out and if her albums are any good. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. There\\u2019s a building that looks kind of like a town hall you\\u2019d rent for a function, but it\\u2019s a bit grander than that. The patio area has these huge columns like the Roman columns you see in ruins. It\\u2019s night time. It\\u2019s dark out. There\\u2019s a lot of people I don\\u2019t know at the party, but there\\u2019s a lot of my classmates from high school there, too. We\\u2019re hanging out but I have this feeling of being the outsider and not really welcomed or not included somehow. I\\u2019m watching what\\u2019s going on and I\\u2019m trying to get the attention of my classmates but I\\u2019m awkward about it and I don\\u2019t really know how. Then one of my classmates who I\\u2019ve known since we were 8 sees me and hangs out together and kinda takes me under his wing. He\\u2019s showing me around this party - just the outside perimeter part, we still haven\\u2019t gone into any of the building. He\\u2019s getting really comfortable with me. His arm is around me and there\\u2019s this air of ownership almost. I do not like it. I remember when we were in high school and flashing back to when he was a little more touchy feely than I liked. I\\u2019m not excited that he\\u2019s doing that, but I also wanted to see everyone. Eventually I peel myself away. Then some sort of time goes by and I\\u2019m walking around this party and I realize there\\u2019s this point on one side where it was the outside of the party and there\\u2019s grass fields and trees. Time is going on normally. But there\\u2019s a partition and on the other side of this line, everything has been frozen. The people there are asleep. I realize that if I cross over this line and walk into it, I can see them, I can see that they\\u2019re asleep or frozen and I can also bring them out of it. When I do, six years has passed on one side of the line and no time has passed on their side. It\\u2019s very odd. They\\u2019re still who they were and time has gone on on the other side. The dreams shifts completely and my two children are with me. We are walking down to the beach. We walk down this path and on either side of the path are noni bushes - bushes I grew up with in Hawaii. As soon as I come out of the path onto the walkway that skirts the edge of the beach, a lifeguard greets me and says, \\u201chello, good morning, welcome.\\u201d I look up and it\\u2019s my ex boyfriend who used to be a lifeguard. I\\u2019m so surprised that he was so friendly to me. I say, \\u201chello.\\u201d He sees who it is and the friendliness disappears immediately. He says something nasty. I ask him if he\\u2019s still going to be mean to me and if he\\u2019s still mad at me. He says essentially yes forever. That hurt my feelings a little bit but I realized there wasn\\u2019t much I could do about that. He couldn\\u2019t keep me off the beach with the kids and we keep going. I see to my left a huge pool - an outdoor pool. Some of those same friends from the party are in the pool and I feel like I\\u2019ve been looking for them. I head their direction and the kids are with me, but again I feel this weird outsider feeling like I wasn\\u2019t quite invited and I\\u2019m going to be the weird kid that shows up at the party even though they weren\\u2019t invited. But I walk towards the pool anyway and both the kids get in the pool because they\\u2019re really excited to swim. I\\u2019m staying on the edge and all those classmates are ignoring me. But then they start playing with my son and teaching him how to jump in the pool. They continue to ignore me even though they can very clearly see me. My daughter is not excited about this either. She can see that there\\u2019s this outsider vibe going and she\\u2019s backing off and away, too. I\\u2019m trying to keep an eye on her and an eye on my son. Then we get out of the pool and begin to walk away. The awkwardness just gets to be too much. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a beach - lots of sand, kiawe trees all around and they\\u2019re hanging kind of low. I\\u2019m on set. There\\u2019s a movie being filmed. I\\u2019m not part of the movie. I\\u2019m just watching. I can hear the ocean rolling in, the waves are not to be big and I\\u2019m listening to the all actors say their lines. There\\u2019s about five of them sitting around in chairs doing their scenes and one of the actors is Henry Cavill - the guy who plays Superman. I\\u2019m a little bit starstruck and awestruck, but I\\u2019m staying out of the way just watching him. I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. So I watch them for a little bit and he takes a while to come out onto the set to do his lines, but then he leaves. I have definitely got an eye on him - just watching everything he does. Then somehow I get incorporated into the scene and it\\u2019s not so much that they\\u2019re filming anymore, it\\u2019s that all of the actors and myself, we\\u2019re all hanging out, working out. The beach setting has changed to an outdoor weight room setting with weight machines. It\\u2019s like we\\u2019re playing musical chairs but we\\u2019re doing it with the weight machines and we all keep going from one to the next. Somehow I\\u2019m part of the crew even though it\\u2019s all the actors now and we take turns doing our sets and then we all rotate one and get moved to the next machines. Of course I still have my eye on Henry Cavill because he played Superman, he\\u2019s hot. But there\\u2019s not a lot of talking still. All the other actors talk amongst themselves quite a bit, but I\\u2019m still quiet and observing for the most part. I think I answer a few questions from some of the other actors, but I\\u2019m feeling shy. Then I leave that place. Even though I\\u2019ve been integrated with the cast, I leave and go somewhere else - it\\u2019s outside and I have the impression that it\\u2019s part of a school. The handyman of the school - who in real life in this realm is the handyman at the place I live - he\\u2019s there at this school. There\\u2019s a big white box truck. He\\u2019s telling me how excited he is because they cleared out the storage units and got rid of hundreds of pounds of meat and pork. I\\u2019m so confused because I don\\u2019t know why they have meat and pork in the storage units because usually the handyman has all of the tools in the storage units. But I ask him, \\u201chey, if you have more, let me know, because if you\\u2019re just giving away really good meat I will take it.\\u201d He says, \\u201cyes, but mostly it\\u2019s all gone.\\u201d I\\u2019m just excited for him because he\\u2019s so excited. Then I leave that place and go back to the set area and now it\\u2019s a much bigger area. It\\u2019s not just that beach. There\\u2019s an actual set where there\\u2019s scenery that\\u2019s been built and put up. It\\u2019s also part of a neighborhood. I can see houses and there\\u2019s streets. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch and I\\u2019m very very tired so I\\u2019m half laying on it. One of the actors - a male - comes and sits next to me. Because we\\u2019ve all spent time getting to know each other, it\\u2019s very comfortable, it\\u2019s fine that he sits next to me. Then I see Henry Cavill come towards me and he doesn\\u2019t have anything in his hand yet, but he kneels down and he says, \\u201cYou have to have known that it was going to be one of the two of us that was going to come and propose to you,\\u201d - but not like a marriage proposal, but just like be my partner for life type of proposal. I\\u2019m smiling at him because I knew that it would happen, I just didn\\u2019t know when. So I say of course. Then he backs up and pulls this violin out from under the couch and some of the other cast members and the orchestra that was part of the movie playing the soundtrack start to play this song and it\\u2019s so funny because it\\u2019s weird and it\\u2019s a little bit high pitched. They\\u2019ve got violins and they\\u2019re all singing the song. I can\\u2019t remember what the words are, but it\\u2019s for me. I\\u2019m laughing because it\\u2019s such a funny sounding song, but apparently the whole cast and crew were in on it because they\\u2019re singing and they all seem very excited. There\\u2019s one moment where I look up and I do see an old classmate of mine who\\u2019s been lurking in the background and for one moment I have this huge pang of jealousy because she knew about it before I did and she didn\\u2019t tell me. I get this sense that she didn\\u2019t want it to happen. She wanted Henry for herself. But I pushed that aside because it\\u2019s very clear that he\\u2019s head over heels and nothing is changing that because now the entire set or staging area or place where this movie is being filmed is full of all of these onlookers and he\\u2019s made such a point to make sure that everybody knows that I\\u2019m his number one person, even though he goes back and does scenes. He comes back to me every single time in the sweetest way. He\\u2019s really very sweet and for the most part, everyone is totally happy about it and I am too. Then the scene shifts just a little bit and I\\u2019m sitting with a young girl who\\u2019s part of the cast and we\\u2019ve moved onto the set. We\\u2019re off that couch and now I\\u2019m onto the set somewhere down on those streets. She\\u2019s getting ready to say her lines and whatnot. She\\u2019s showing me this necklace that she has and she says, \\u201cMy mama gave me money for when I finish this play I could go buy a bike.\\u201d She shows me the bike, but this girl is maybe five or six, not really reading yet, but she\\u2019s really really cute with curly blonde hair and this necklace seems to be very important to her - it has the symbol of a bike on it. I\\u2019m very attentive to her and some other babies that end up in the crowd and I\\u2019m watching them. Even though it\\u2019s now part of the scene we\\u2019re creating, Henry and I have a baby between us - it\\u2019s not ours, it\\u2019s a baby that was cast in the role, but he and I are now acting with this baby and taking care of it in a way. Then the scene ends and the dream moves on, but I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting in an outdoor market. It\\u2019s sunny out and warm. I have shorts and a tank top on, my hair is down, and I\\u2019m having a beverage of some sort, doing some work. I look up and I see across the way, two women heading my direction. One is tall and dark hair, pale skin. The other one is shorter with lighter skin and blonde hair. I recognize the tall dark one, she is a friend of mine, or we were friends but it ended strangely and abruptly and I still have feelings of sadness, frustration and hurt around it. So, I see them strolling through this open marketplace and pretend not to see them - I put my face down and go back to work and put my hand up over my face. However, they stop right in front of my table anyway and when I look up, the tall dark-haired one says hello and seems to be very happy to see me. I\\u2019m a little bit cautious and wary and say hello and ask how they are and what do they want? nicely but I don\\u2019t feel particularly warm towards them. However, they persist and the tall dark-haired one invites me to go with them just to continue wandering around outside. It is such a nice day. I actually say okay. Part of me is warming up to her, but part of me still wants to say, hey you ghosted me, why are you even talking to me now? We start wandering through the marketplace and we go into shops and out of shops. I think we both already had our coffee or beverages, but we wander around getting gelato and some other things. At one point, she hands me a ring. I look at the ring, it\\u2019s very simple, I think there\\u2019s just a couple of stones in it, and I don\\u2019t remember what the stones are. It fits on my finger, which is rare because I have larger fingers. It\\u2019s lovely and I love rings, so I wear the ring. We continue to walk around and at what point we walk past this group of my other high school friends who are out on a lawn doing a bootcamp style workout. I introduced my taller friend and my shorter friend to the friends of mine who are doing this bootcamp. For whatever reason, I am struggling to remember the shorter blonde friend\\u2019s name, even though I know it, I\\u2019m having the hardest time in the introduction. I keep beating around the bush hoping she\\u2019ll just introduce herself, which she doesn\\u2019t and it just feels awkward and I eventually give it up as a bad job because I just can\\u2019t remember her name. After the awkward introductions we join them in their bootcamp. They\\u2019re doing abs. And so we all get into a hollow rock and I show them how to do a hollow rock with good technique. Then that\\u2019s done and we all get up. The tall friend and shorter friend and I continue on our way. Now we\\u2019re out from the marketplace and we\\u2019re in a slightly wooded area, but we\\u2019re walking through a corridor where there are no trees - the trees are on either side of us. It\\u2019s warm, so they\\u2019re all green and in full leaf and it\\u2019s a grassy area - it\\u2019s not a path, it\\u2019s wider than a path - that we\\u2019re walking through. In the distance, I can see there\\u2019s a cage and there\\u2019s people in it and there\\u2019s also all this light glinting off of metal. This metal looks like a wave or when a bird flaps its wings or when you watch a bunch of birds flying together or a school of fish and they all move together at the same time. As I get closer, we can see that it is indeed people, but instead of hands they have butcher knives and that\\u2019s the metal that the light is being glinted off of. They\\u2019re moving all in unison as a wave, doing some sort of dance in this cage, which is rather tightly packed and they\\u2019re managing not to cut themselves. However in my mind I\\u2019m thinking they must be rather dangerous because they are in a cage and they have butcher knives for hands. They are all men in business suits. We continue on after watching them for a little bit and there\\u2019s another cage right past this one. In this cage the people all have scissors for hands, kind of like Edward Scissorhands, the movie. We go by, but one of them calls out to us and stops us and tells my taller friend to give him some of the pearls that she has. She has two pearls and so she gives two of them. We watch as somehow with these scissor hands he makes two pearl earrings. He also has some other pieces that go with the pearls, so these earrings become rather big like a larger stone at the bottom and the pearl at the top, and he\\u2019s somehow managing to make these while we\\u2019re standing there. They are absolutely beautiful. He has scissor hands, he\\u2019s still doing it and we\\u2019re not sure how this is happening, but he makes this beautiful pair of earrings reaching through the bars of the cage this whole time. No one has been let out of any cages. She takes the earrings when he\\u2019s done and we continue on. It\\u2019s the most strange thing. We move past these cages and now we\\u2019re in a home of sorts. We\\u2019re all wanting a shower, it\\u2019s been hot out. So we go through this little shower that is part of this home - the rest of the home I don\\u2019t see at all. I just see that the shower is all tile and it\\u2019s the small 1x1 tile squares. They\\u2019re all a dark grey, but also translucent - kind of reminds me of labradorite, but instead of blues and greens, it\\u2019s greys. I drop my ring in the shower somewhere and I\\u2019m so upset about it. I want to find it. The two friends have gone on ahead of me. I was the last one in and they have wandered off somewhere. Now I\\u2019m on hands and knees looking for this ring. It\\u2019s kind of gross because the floor of the shower is covered in hair. The shower is for anyone to use even though it\\u2019s in a home, so who knows what I\\u2019m crawling through and I\\u2019m really grossed out. On the other hand I\\u2019m really fascinated because every single corner and crevice of this shower has, along with the hair and other gross stuff, a bunch of different beautiful rings. None of them look like the one I dropped which I\\u2019m getting upset about because it was given to me by this friend, but they\\u2019re all gorgeous. They all have different stones in them. They\\u2019re all different sizes. Some of them are the kind where they incase your entire finger. Some of them are very simple - one little golden band with a tiny little opal heart. One of them has gold shaped up and around and sticks up off your finger. They\\u2019re just amazing and I\\u2019m picking up all these rings. This other pair of women come in. As I\\u2019m picking up all these rings I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cthese are beautiful and I\\u2019m going to keep some of them, but also I really want to find mine.\\u201d But this other pair of women come in and start looking for a ring they\\u2019ve lost and I don\\u2019t want to show them all the ones I have, but they start crawling around on the ground and they\\u2019re picking up rings, too. So eventually we compare rings. She finds the one she\\u2019s looking for. I don\\u2019t find mine, but I find others. I\\u2019m really sort of heartbroken about this. At this point I take the rings I want and I go out the backdoor of this shower place and I meet up with my two friends who have been waiting for me. We continue on and now we\\u2019re in some place that looks like the pictures I\\u2019ve seen of Merikesh where there\\u2019s lots of stone everywhere and stone arches and they\\u2019re lighter in color. We\\u2019re walking through and I\\u2019m beginning to get sad because I know our time is coming to an end and both friends are going to leave and I still haven\\u2019t found the ring even though I\\u2019ve got ones that I like. I know that I have no idea when I\\u2019ll see either of these friends again and it\\u2019s making me a little upset. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I am in a hotel room of some sort. I can see the curtains with the air conditioner underneath and the bed that\\u2019s all made up the way they do in hotel rooms with neatly turned corners and tons of pillows. My ex-husband is with me in the hotel room. We are exes. He has his own girlfriend now and our kids are around somewhere with us; I\\u2019m not sure where - the rest of the hotel room is not clear. But I am so horny I cannot help myself. I\\u2019m feeling these waves of disgust because I\\u2019m contemplating asking my ex to have sex with me even though I really don\\u2019t like him. I\\u2019m observing myself just having this torn feeling between really needing to have sex and really not wanting to have sex with my ex. I hear myself at one point say, \\u201cWell, he has a girlfriend now, so that wouldn\\u2019t be good, but maybe if he just wears a condom.\\u201d The feelings that move through me in the dream and in real life that I\\u2019m still so disgusted for even contemplating it and yet am still really torn - all of that arises in the dream and that\\u2019s the only part of the dream I remember.\"],[\"I am at my place of work and I really enjoy where I am. It has a really bright and light feeling. I can\\u2019t see exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I can\\u2019t exactly see the people around me, but I know I like them and I know that where I am feels really good. I feel like I have purpose. I feel very open and excited to do it. I have two other work engagements and I\\u2019m not as excited about either of those, but I know it\\u2019s time for me to move to my second job, so I leave this light and bright place. I go into this hardware store that\\u2019s kind of dingy and smells metallic like hardware stores do with the little mix of oil. It\\u2019s very dim lighting with fluorescent lights over the top hanging low in the ceiling but only half of them work. I can\\u2019t tell exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I think I\\u2019m organizing nuts and bolts or cleaning something out. I know I\\u2019m greasy and dirty. The woman I\\u2019m working for, the owner, is there. She\\u2019s a mother and she has these two boys that aren\\u2019t hers but they\\u2019re in her care somehow. She also has a baby with her and at one point the baby is needing care and she has a fish she\\u2019s caught. The fish needs to be filleted and cooked and somehow I\\u2019m the one who knows how to do that. So I fillet the fish and I can see the individual muscles - the layers - the way a fish fillet is layered. The baby seems to be sickly and crying and is sitting in a carrier to my right. I fillet this fish and cook it and then take one of the layers off and give it to the baby to eat. This baby seems to be 5 or 6 months old, so it seems kind of strange that I\\u2019m giving it fish, but it seems to be what it needs. There\\u2019s this overall air of sadness and grief, like this baby is going to die anyway even if I give it this nourishing fish. Then I\\u2019m back speaking with the mother and she\\u2019s asking me to keep an eye on her two boys that aren\\u2019t really hers, but she\\u2019s taking care of. I go with the boys to her house. One boy goes in the house and stays in the house and one boy stays out. They\\u2019re twins and one is not allowed inside the house, the other is. The father doesn\\u2019t let the other one in. I\\u2019m watching the two of them and as I\\u2019m watching one boy cross over this threshold and the other stay behind, this group or gang of boys from the neighborhood come. They have some sort of laundry detergent or white powder they\\u2019ve picked up from the hardware store. They throw it into the eyes of both of the boys because neither of the boys are really the children of the family - that seems to be the reason anyway. The one boy who\\u2019s allowed in the house starts to cry and he\\u2019s screaming and he\\u2019s trying to clean the powder off his face. He gets taken care of - someone in the house takes care of him, washes his eyes out. The boy that\\u2019s not allowed in the house is crying and screaming and I go to take care of him. But I\\u2019m not allowed to take care of him. Someone else is taking him. And now some time has passed and I\\u2019m standing in the bedroom - it\\u2019s an upstairs bedroom. I\\u2019m looking out the window, and to my left is the boy allowed in the house. He\\u2019s on the bed and has bandages over his eyes. As I\\u2019m looking out this second or third story window, I\\u2019m looking out at this outdoor shed or barn and it has a huge human size cage hanging from it and the other boy is in it and his eyes are bandaged. It looks like they tried to make it comfortable for him to lay down, but it is a wire cage that\\u2019s rested. He\\u2019s lying down trying to convalesce. Then all of a sudden I remember I still never went to my third job, which was working for my mother, and I really don\\u2019t want to do that. She has been calling me this whole time reminding me that I owed her - that I was supposed to show up, that I\\u2019m supposed to be there, that I\\u2019m supposed to do this work for her. I would answer the call and talk to her, then put the phone down and promptly forget that I was supposed to be there. And now it\\u2019s time for me to go and I don\\u2019t go. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a coffee shop and I see a friend of mine who is working there. I haven\\u2019t seen her for a while. I ask if she wants to hang out but it feels strange. She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it\\u2019s not very big, there\\u2019s not a lot of space. She\\u2019s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I\\u2019m asking her while she\\u2019s busy, and it\\u2019s not that she doesn\\u2019t want to hang out. The scene changes and I\\u2019m in a residential area of a town and I\\u2019m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I\\u2019m walking up a hill and she\\u2019s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I\\u2019m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She\\u2019s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It\\u2019s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don\\u2019t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They\\u2019re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I\\u2019m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It\\u2019s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there\\u2019s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there\\u2019s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I\\u2019m a little bit wary because there\\u2019s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don\\u2019t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don\\u2019t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I\\u2019m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It\\u2019s actually another sort of twilight, but it\\u2019s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it\\u2019s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I\\u2019m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it\\u2019s cordial. Suddenly he\\u2019s talking to me like we\\u2019re still lovers. I\\u2019m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle.\\u201d The voice is also telling me, \\u201cYou can still be kind, you can still be kind.\\u201d So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he\\u2019s going to take me with him. So we\\u2019ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there\\u2019s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It\\u2019s where he lives. He has an apartment. He\\u2019s very very familiar with me and I\\u2019m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He\\u2019s a surfer and he\\u2019s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he\\u2019s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I\\u2019m actually quite glad that he\\u2019s going. So again, I\\u2019m being as encouraging as possible. I\\u2019m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don\\u2019t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I\\u2019m just sending him off for a little bit and then he\\u2019ll be back. But in my mind I\\u2019m sending him off like he\\u2019s going off on a quest and I won't\\u2019 see him for a long while. I\\u2019m relieved that I wont\\u2019 see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he\\u2019s really proud of. I\\u2019m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he\\u2019s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I\\u2019m satisfied with how I\\u2019ve handled all of it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people - I know some of them, they\\u2019re acquaintances that I\\u2019ve met here where I live, but we\\u2019re not close. We\\u2019ve met up and we\\u2019re going to a concert, but it\\u2019s music I don\\u2019t know or I don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not excited about it, but it\\u2019s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There\\u2019s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it\\u2019s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we\\u2019re listening, and I\\u2019m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I\\u2019ve met them before or they\\u2019re from some era of my past. We\\u2019re listening and while we\\u2019re listening there\\u2019s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it\\u2019s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m just sewing away and now it\\u2019s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can\\u2019t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I\\u2019m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don\\u2019t tangle my threads and it\\u2019s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I\\u2019m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I\\u2019ve been in a bowling alley. There\\u2019s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I\\u2019m just watching them bowl and they\\u2019re all having a really good time. It\\u2019s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I\\u2019ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It\\u2019s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it\\u2019s time for me to bowl. It\\u2019s not time because I\\u2019m part of their team or anything; I\\u2019m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I\\u2019m so terrible at it. It\\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. So, I\\u2019m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there\\u2019s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it\\u2019s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can\\u2019t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can\\u2019t go head on or straight. So it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there\\u2019s a person sitting in the way. So it\\u2019s my turn again and I go to him and say, \\u201cCould you please move so I can bowl correctly?\\u201d The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he\\u2019s watching me to see if I\\u2019m going to get it. There\\u2019s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I\\u2019m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it\\u2019s my turn and he\\u2019s not in my way, I go to bowl and it\\u2019s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It\\u2019s the most beautiful bowl you\\u2019ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I only remember a snippet of this dream. I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It\\u2019s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I\\u2019m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It\\u2019s warm so I don\\u2019t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I\\u2019m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I\\u2019ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I\\u2019m headed back in their direction. As I\\u2019m walking down the street, I\\u2019m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There\\u2019s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there\\u2019s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there\\u2019s very tall windows - they\\u2019re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it\\u2019s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I\\u2019m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I\\u2019m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She\\u2019s talking to her daughter. She\\u2019s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there\\u2019s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that\\u2019s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I\\u2019m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I\\u2019m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There\\u2019s an awkwardness now because I don\\u2019t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She\\u2019s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I\\u2019ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I\\u2019m wearing doesn\\u2019t have any pockets and I also suddenly can\\u2019t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I\\u2019m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I\\u2019m so distraught and I wonder if it\\u2019s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don\\u2019t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It\\u2019s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There\\u2019s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody\\u2019s birthday, I\\u2019m not sure whose. Maybe we\\u2019re celebrating everybody\\u2019s birthday. We\\u2019re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There\\u2019s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we\\u2019re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I\\u2019m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I\\u2019m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I\\u2019ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s this man I want you to meet.\\u201d She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it\\u2019s Cyril or something but I don\\u2019t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I\\u2019m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I\\u2019m at her home and it\\u2019s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We\\u2019re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis is the person I want you to meet.\\u201d He\\u2019s got this leather jacket and his hair is longish and curly or wavy and dark. Yes, he\\u2019s definitely good looking, but all my alarm bells are going off because he\\u2019s riding a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket - how cliche. And he\\u2019s got tattoos. She says, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s a plant medicine maker, so he knows how to make medicine from plants.\\u201d That peaks my interest because you don\\u2019t meet a lot of men who know how to do that. But I\\u2019m still feeling like I\\u2019m being put on the spot and I don't appreciate matchmaking. It feels awkward because I know he\\u2019s been invited there to meet with me. I don\\u2019t like those kind of situations. I would much rather there be an organic conversation where you\\u2019ve met or something. In this part of the dream I am feeling so awkward with meeting this guy. But I\\u2019m still feeling tender feelings for my friend - I still love her very much and I don't care that she\\u2019s set me up with this dude. I think it\\u2019s kind of funny. Anyway, I\\u2019m not into it. In the next part of the dream, I\\u2019m taking him and a couple friends on a tour. The dream switches scenes again. Now I\\u2019ve left my friend who has done the introductions, but this guy is with me. He\\u2019s off the motorcycle at this point and there are other guys with him. They\\u2019re his friends, I think, but they\\u2019re all strangers to me. I\\u2019m giving them a tour of what I think is my old high school, but it\\u2019s in the snow and my old high school was in Hawaii. So this version of my high school is somewhere in the snow - there\\u2019s lots of ice. We get in a car and I\\u2019m driving them up and around the drive that usually takes us to the school. We drive past the chapel part I grew up going to, past the admissions building. I\\u2019m taking them onto campus because these guys are all going to run a race. So it\\u2019s a bunch of hotshot runners or super athletic guys. Again I\\u2019m asking myself, \\u201cWhy am I with all these guys? Why am I showing them around?\\u201d So we actually end up driving past the beginning of the race and we have to go park way down below in a parking lot. To get to the beginning of the race is a ton of stairs covered in snow and ice. Now because it took a while to drive around, school has let out, so there\\u2019s a bunch of students out and it\\u2019s really really crowded. So these men I\\u2019m leading around are getting a little bit frustrated because it\\u2019s taking extra long to get to the race. They\\u2019re worried they\\u2019re going to miss it - it\\u2019s a running, cross country race. It\\u2019s cold and they\\u2019re in their running shorts - not my problem. I lead them up to the beginning of the race through all these stairs. We\\u2019re winding our ways through the crowds, being careful not to slip on the ice. The headmaster of the school comes to greet us. What\\u2019s interesting is that the school now has a ton of people of color going to it, including black people, but these guys I\\u2019m bringing with me are all white. This is interesting because I\\u2019m noticing as we\\u2019re walking through the crowd, the guys I\\u2019m leading are being rude. They\\u2019re totally trying to use their white male dominance to move themselves through this crowd. They\\u2019re pissing a lot of people off. So the headmaster meets me, and the headmaster in this dream is actually the head of the Waldorf School my kids currently go to now. Her name is Cecilia and she\\u2019s a woman of color. She meets me and helps me lead these men to the start of the race. But she is giving them a lecture on white male privilege, dominance, the patriarchy and their atrocious behavior. There\\u2019s a part of me rubbing my hands in glee, getting to listen to Cecilia school these men who have been incredibly arrogant. We get to the start of the race, which is interesting, because it\\u2019s actually through a bunch of buildings and they have to race through a bunch of doorways before they can get outside. It\\u2019s literally doorways and Cecilia has had me go open up some of the doors so they know which doors to go through. I mark them somehow, so there\\u2019s literally a little note that says, \\u201cRun through this door,\\u201d so they can find their way to the outside, because there is an outside part of this race, but it literally starts in a building and they have to run through these doorways. Now Cecilia has been joined by a male teacher of color who is continuing the lesson and lecture for these white men who are all still in their running gear - short shorts, tennis shoes, a sweater because it\\u2019s cold. They are finishing up this lecture and the white men are part of this other group. The other group has people of color in it. They\\u2019re not in the front to start this race. I really don't know how it\\u2019s going to go because everyone has to run through these doors and these doors are not lined up one after the other. You run through a door, then you have to hang a right to go through another door. It\\u2019s quite maze-like until you get out. But they\\u2019re all set up, ready to go, and the lecturing is done. Sure enough, somebody shoots off one of those little start guns and they start running through. The dream ends there.\"],[\"The first one is me someplace warm, at least I\\u2019m wearing a tanktop and shorts. I have protectors around me and I don't feel I\\u2019m in danger, but I do feel I\\u2019m new. I\\u2019m learning some things, so I need guidance and someone or something to keep an eye on me and that\\u2019s exactly what I have. I\\u2019m actually learning to fly and to use some of my other superpowers. So my two protectors are there to show me how to do the things and make sure I don\\u2019t hurt myself. One is golden in color and I keep seeing a lion or mountain lion as the shape of this particular protector, but they tend to shapeshift into human form, too. When this lion or mountain lion is in human form, it\\u2019s a male with blonde/gold hair and green eyes and nicely chiseled body. The other protector is a black jaguar with wings. It has big black wings on it and it flies around and shows me how to fly - that\\u2019s one of the things I\\u2019m trying to learn. I keep seeing places that look very similar to my childhood home in this dream. I\\u2019m on a balcony and this balcony reminds me of the balcony that was outside my parents\\u2019 bedroom. The view from it looks like the view from my house which is looking out onto a lava rock desert that\\u2019s got dried grasses and smaller shrubs growing. The grasses are all golden in color, too. I\\u2019m aware of my protectors\\u2019 presence. I do see them fly off on occasion, go take care of things and come back. I\\u2019m just observing the whole time, trying to figure out how to fly, myself. I\\u2019m aware that they are going off to fight things, then they come back. I\\u2019m a little concerned because I don\\u2019t want them to get hurt, but they seem to be fine every time. Then the dream shifts a little bit to another spot where I\\u2019m walking across and open space - kind of a grassy space, but I can feel there are other things around me like maybe trees and possibly houses, but I\\u2019m not completely aware of what is around me. I just know there is enough space for me to practice my flying and I\\u2019m in human form for this. I start walking and the black jaguar is with me. He\\u2019s encouraging me not to start flying, but I\\u2019m not really listening and doing it anyway. So I start running as fast as I can, and sure enough, I take a leap and it launches me into the air. I start flying up and up and up. I can control it. I can direct it. I can make myself go in the direction I want to go in. One of the guardians is with me flying - I can't tell which one. I\\u2019m doing a really good job of flying around. I have a particular direction I head - it\\u2019s towards a taller apartment complex. I\\u2019m heading there because there's a particular balcony I want to land on but I can\\u2019t remember why or what I\\u2019m doing. But I have purpose, I just don\\u2019t remember what it is. I\\u2019m mostly impressed that I am actually flying because it seems there are so many dreams when you want to fly and you run and run and run but never get off the ground. But in this one I do. Then a couple dream segments go by, which I can\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s totally shifted now. I\\u2019m in a cave and this cave is also a bar. There\\u2019s a huge dance party going on, like a rave. I have no idea why I\\u2019m there because I don\\u2019t do raves and I don\\u2019t drink. It\\u2019s also late and I don\\u2019t like to stay up late. The people in this rave are all my high school classmates and they are the last people I want to see. I don\\u2019t want to interact with them. I don\\u2019t want to know what they\\u2019ve all been doing for the last 20 years because I definitely feel I won\\u2019t have anything cool to share and there will be a lot of judgment around where I find myself currently in terms of accomplishments in life. I also have a very thick layer of judgment around the fact that they all still drink together and that\\u2019s what they do, and their friendship is based on having drank alcohol for the last 20 years and that just in no way excites me. I don\\u2019t want to be around it. So as I\\u2019m in this crowd, I\\u2019m making sure to avoid all my classmates and not be seen by them. I\\u2019m trying to get out of the cave so I can be outside because the cave is dark and imposing. I don\\u2019t want to be in that kind of place - it\\u2019s too heavy. I want to be out where there\\u2019s sunshine and fresh air. So I make my way out. My hair is down and I\\u2019m wearing shorter shorts and a crop top. I do seem to be dressed for clubbing, but I\\u2019m not into it. I make my way out of the cave - the cave is where the dancing is happening - and on my way out is where the bar is. First I pass a little waterfall that\\u2019s coming down this rock cliff. The cave is all rock, but the entrance is also rock and it\\u2019s open on one side, but there\\u2019s rock on the other. The side that has the rock wall is where the bar is. I\\u2019m wanting to go past the bar because I can see above this rock wall, it shifts into green grass that goes up an incline for quite a ways. Beyond the green grass, I can see forest is starting. I want to head up that way. I can also see that halfway up this hill, there\\u2019s a ton of people milling about. It\\u2019s almost like this grassy area and hill is a tourist destination that people climb up to go see. It reminds me of the Tor in England, but it\\u2019s definitely not a sacred site in that way. Halfway up this hill is a plateau with a round circle that reminds me of a caldera - the inside of a volcano. Inside is a bunch of workout bikes, like exercise bikes. I want to go up there and go get some exercise in. So I can see my destination - I can see where I want to go. But I have to get past this bar and all of my classmates first. I can see that the wall of the bar which is all rock similar to the cave is kind of consuming people. I can see it curl in and it doesn\\u2019t eat them or kill them, but they never really come out once it curls up and over them. I can see this happening, so I want to get out as quick as I can. But I have to go past and the last group of people on my way out is all my classmates. I\\u2019m just watching them and staying pretty hidden because it\\u2019s very easy for me to pull a veil over me. Even though I\\u2019m very noticable, I\\u2019ve pulled a veil around me and they can't see me. So I\\u2019m just observing and watching as they\\u2019re drinking and dancing and yelling at each other. It seems like they\\u2019re having a good time, but I still don\\u2019t want any part of it. One of my friends from high school - a particular classmate who happens to be in my dreams pretty often - she\\u2019s the bartender and she is singing and rapping and entertaining everyone while they\\u2019re dancing. I\\u2019m really just wanting to scooch by and all of a sudden I realize I don't have my phone and my phone is somewhere back in that cave. I don\\u2019t want to go back in it because I see that now the cave is somehow consuming people and I don\\u2019t want to do that. But I catch this friend\\u2019s eye and she sees that I\\u2019m trying to get out. She seems cool with it and I tell her I can\\u2019t go because I don't have my phone. She says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. I\\u2019ll go get it.\\u201d She goes in to get it. Meanwhile, I\\u2019m watching the rest of my friends dance, but also disappear. I can see that the rock wall of the bar is coming up and it\\u2019s cresting over me like a wave. There is water under me. I have to dive down as fast as I can and dive forward as fast as I can to get out in front of this rock wave that\\u2019s curling. I do, but of course I\\u2019m totally panicked. It only takes me once and I\\u2019m in front. My friend shows up and hands me my phone and I can leave. I get out of there as fast as I can, leaving all my friends having a great time partying. I\\u2019m at this point completely panicked because I\\u2019ve almost been consumed. I get out of there as fast as I can and head up towards the green. While I\\u2019m on my way out, this couple introduces themselves to me. They come out of nowhere. They don\\u2019t speak English and I don\\u2019t speak their language, but somehow we are communicating and talking. They want to introduce me to their son or daughter whoever it is. But I\\u2019m so desperate to get out at this point that i say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to meet you, and I hope you enjoy your visit here.\\u201d They\\u2019re visiting and somehow I know this even though neither of us are speaking each other\\u2019s language. Then the dream shifts to a grocery store parking lot. I\\u2019m showing up there because there\\u2019s some sort of meeting like an AA meeting, or a meeting of people coming together for a particular cause, but it\\u2019s one of those info sessions then they try to sell you something. I\\u2019m standing there trying to gather the information and feeling this information is really important. In the end I realize they are just trying to get me to join their church or cult or whatever it is. It\\u2019s something I don't want to join and I\\u2019m so disappointed that I wasted my time standing in this parking lot when I could have been doing something else. I get in my car and drive away. Then the dream shifts to something else but I don\\u2019t remember it.\"],[\"Just a few snippets of dream: one is an outside battle of sorts happening. There\\u2019s some forces that are trying to wipe me and my companions out. I\\u2019m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I\\u2019m responsible as I\\u2019m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it\\u2019s a general feeling of protecting, but I\\u2019m not sure who I\\u2019m protecting. It\\u2019s not anyone in particular, it\\u2019s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don\\u2019t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don\\u2019t even know what's coming for us, I\\u2019m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we\\u2019re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that\\u2019s coming towards us. So whatever it is that\\u2019s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn\\u2019t last. As the battle continues, it\\u2019s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can\\u2019t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don\\u2019t know and his friend who I also don\\u2019t know. The first group I\\u2019m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they\\u2019re getting a tour of a ranch. I\\u2019m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also has an herb garden where they\\u2019re allowed to gather some herbs as souvenirs. I am down there with them. There\\u2019s chives or green onions that we\\u2019re growing but they\\u2019ve dried somehow. So you can pick them up and take the dried chives with you. There\\u2019s also lemongrass and a bunch of herbs and people are able to gather them. I\\u2019m gathering them and working the ranch - that\\u2019s my role. I\\u2019m part of the tour but I also have work to do on this ranch to keep it going. The man is the owner of the ranch and there are a ton of other people who work on the ranch with separate roles. There\\u2019s a bookkeeper and all these other people that I don\\u2019t know who have roles and do a lot of planning for the tours or parties that come through, they do this man\\u2019s finances and just sort of run things for him. I\\u2019m mostly a little worker bee out on the land. So this group of people comes and goes and I'm getting the feeling this is a regular stop on a tour. Then the scene shifts a little bit from daytime to evening. The man is in the carriage thing and he asks me to go for a ride with him. His friend is driving the carriage. I get in and we head down the driveway like we\\u2019re going to leave the ranch. There's a place where the road turns and on the right hand side there\\u2019s a huge mud pit. You can see old tire tracks in it, but I\\u2019m really concerned because if the carriage falls into this mud pit, it is never coming out. I\\u2019m watching the friend struggle a little bit. He\\u2019s really close to the edge and I\\u2019m concerned. He has all my attention even though this other man who I\\u2019m sitting in the carriage with doesn\\u2019t seem to be concerned at all. He\\u2019s keeping a conversation going with me and I have one mind on the conversation with him and one mind on the fact that this carriage could get really stuck and fall off into the gigantic mud pit. I finally say something to this man and he says not to worry. At this point, the carriage turns itself around so I can see the entrance of the ranch with this big sign. It dawns on me that the whole reason for the driver to have been going so close to the mud pit was a distraction technique so that I wouldn\\u2019t turn behind me and see what they were doing to the sign on the ranch. When the driver finally does turn the carriage around, I see the sign on the ranch and it\\u2019s a marriage proposal from this man in the carriage. I\\u2019m so confused because this man is essentially my boss all the time and we don\\u2019t have any relationship that I know of and all the people that work for him have been changing out this sign and preparing this whole thing. I\\u2019m a little bit speechless and really confused and thinking that there\\u2019s another person this man would rather be with. I remember sort of sitting in the carriage going: \\u201cWell let\\u2019s try some things out and see how we work together.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a large house with two stories. I think it's my ex-husband\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m not sure. He\\u2019s there or his presence is felt at least, but I don\\u2019t actually see him. There is an upstairs bedroom with a crib in it. There are two babies in it. One of the babies is mine or I gave birth to it. I can\\u2019t tell. It\\u2019s about a year and half and I have this knowing that I left it when it was younger and I\\u2019m coming back now. I\\u2019m not sure why I\\u2019m coming back. I just know that when I see this baby in the cradle that it needs nourishment - it needs feeding. So I bring it to my breast to nurse it. I\\u2019m worried that ti didn\\u2019t get all the nutrients it needed when it was younger. So while I\\u2019m nursing it, I can feel that it\\u2019s a relief for me somehow - like when you get engorged it is taking the pressure off my chest, out of my breast and the baby is getting what it needs. But the whole time I have this sense of sorrow or sadness like I had perhaps abandoned the baby or there was some reason why I wasn\\u2019t able to be with the baby when it was younger and I\\u2019m only coming back now to tend it now that it\\u2019s a year and a half. As I nurse the baby I can feel the relief in my chest and my breasts. It\\u2019s sucking hard like it\\u2019s desperate to get what I have for itself. This is the only part of the dream I remember; there are other pieces, but those are gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It\\u2019s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we\\u2019re on our way to the place. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s a road that\\u2019s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We\\u2019re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there\\u2019s a ravine under us. We\\u2019re headed to a cave where we\\u2019re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it\\u2019s like - it\\u2019s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I\\u2019m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there\\u2019s water that\\u2019s swirling around the rocks. It\\u2019s so fun because we\\u2019re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I\\u2019m floating and we\\u2019re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We\\u2019re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it\\u2019s smooth and flat. It\\u2019s still light in a sense, it\\u2019s not full daylight. We can still see. It\\u2019s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we\\u2019re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It\\u2019s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I\\u2019ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it\\u2019s very particular, it\\u2019s something I asked for. Then it\\u2019s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I\\u2019m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that\\u2019s everywhere and the flowers - they\\u2019re gathering them. It\\u2019s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There\\u2019s now a table. There\\u2019s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she\\u2019s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they\\u2019re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we\\u2019re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we\\u2019re carrying bags of trash because we\\u2019ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we\\u2019re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn\\u2019t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. It\\u2019s evening time. I am walking around a college campus. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who\\u2019s with me, but it\\u2019s another woman. I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She\\u2019s beautiful. She\\u2019s a little bit sad - she\\u2019s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she\\u2019s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it\\u2019s like an artist studio. It\\u2019s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She\\u2019s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there\\u2019s not much room. We\\u2019re hanging out with her and I\\u2019m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn\\u2019t even have a bathroom and I don\\u2019t think it has a kitchen area - it\\u2019s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She\\u2019s still really, really sad. I\\u2019m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she\\u2019s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend\\u2019s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There\\u2019s a little tension between them, like a depression. They\\u2019re together but they\\u2019re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don\\u2019t know why. They\\u2019re talking and there\\u2019s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it\\u2019s going to be fine - let\\u2019s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it\\u2019s full dark now. There\\u2019s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He\\u2019s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he\\u2019s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He\\u2019s kind of got a belly. He just doesn\\u2019t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there\\u2019s other college kids lingering around. There\\u2019s stuff happening and I\\u2019m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I\\u2019m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It\\u2019s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don\\u2019t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they\\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\\u2019s very orderly. It\\u2019s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they\\u2019re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it\\u2019s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I\\u2019m watching these people come and go and there\\u2019s this competitive energy in me where I\\u2019m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It\\u2019s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There\\u2019s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who\\u2019s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That\\u2019s the atmosphere that we\\u2019re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We\\u2019re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There\\u2019s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there\\u2019s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it\\u2019s mine. But he\\u2019s holding the baby and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I sort of like holding the baby.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don\\u2019t say anything but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, we should do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we\\u2019ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we\\u2019re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He\\u2019s in a costume of some sort and he\\u2019s asking me if I recognize who he is. I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s familiar but I can\\u2019t quite place it.\\u201d Somebody says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your gloves.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cOh yeah my gloves!\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, your Hans Solo!\\u201d He runs off to get his gloves and I\\u2019m still somehow totally content because we\\u2019re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he\\u2019s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There\\u2019s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he\\u2019s at least 10 years younger - which is why I\\u2019m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it\\u2019s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he\\u2019s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I\\u2019m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It\\u2019s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I\\u2019m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, but we\\u2019re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I\\u2019m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it\\u2019s a spaceship. It\\u2019s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they\\u2019re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I\\u2019m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they\\u2019re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I\\u2019m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I\\u2019m starting to be crushed. So I\\u2019m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It\\u2019s me and my friend, Aila. We\\u2019re in a car together, traveling. It\\u2019s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There\\u2019s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it\\u2019s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He\\u2019s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He\\u2019s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don\\u2019t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he\\u2019s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it\\u2019s the sample. It\\u2019s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that\\u2019s made out of gold and it\\u2019s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who\\u2019s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there\\u2019s something up with these bracelets because the material they\\u2019re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, we all need one of these.\\u201d He\\u2019s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it\\u2019s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that\\u2019s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he\\u2019s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there\\u2019s more, but that's all I can remember right now.\"],[\"Holy crap. This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I\\u2019m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he\\u2019s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he\\u2019s talking with me and he\\u2019s trying to court me. He\\u2019s showing me all the things he\\u2019s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he\\u2019s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he\\u2019s done, he\\u2019s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it\\u2019s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He\\u2019s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It\\u2019s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I\\u2019m in my home now - it\\u2019s not very descriptive, I just know I\\u2019m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn\\u2019t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That\\u2019s my first \\u201coh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn\\u2019t look very safe. She\\u2019s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it\\u2019s falling out. There\\u2019s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it\\u2019s also filthy. She\\u2019s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I\\u2019m offering to make them a meal - I guess they\\u2019re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she\\u2019s wild. She doesn\\u2019t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He\\u2019s just telling her what to do. He\\u2019s literally telling her: \\u201cOkay, now do this, do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s so proud of himself. He thinks he\\u2019s being the best dad. I\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god, your daughter is wrecked.\\u201d I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I\\u2019m with the next man in the lineup. It\\u2019s my ex-husband. He\\u2019s different. He\\u2019s also trying to show me how different he is. He\\u2019s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We\\u2019re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There\\u2019s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we\\u2019re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I\\u2019m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I\\u2019m really excited for their blind date. I\\u2019m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we\\u2019re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they\\u2019re snuggling up. I\\u2019m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it\\u2019s cute, it\\u2019s sweet. There\\u2019s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it\\u2019s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there\\u2019s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: \\u201cCan she do it? Is she strong enough?\\u201d Since he\\u2019s already over my back, he\\u2019s essentially in the fireman\\u2019s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\\u2019t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.\\u201d I realize that that\\u2019s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I\\u2019m with the next man. It\\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you\\u2019re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He\\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We\\u2019re hanging out and i\\u2019s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there\\u2019s also different types of equipment around, too. There\\u2019s these three younger men and they\\u2019re teachers or they\\u2019re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: \\u201cOh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.\\u201d So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We\\u2019ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He\\u2019s so attentive and affectionate. He\\u2019s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he\\u2019s getting agitated and I think that\\u2019s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn\\u2019t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken\\u2019s hat and I\\u2019d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He\\u2019s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5\\u20196\\u201d, I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d and Luke\\u2019s about 6\\u20192\\u201d or 3\\u201d or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It\\u2019s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I\\u2019ve seen you strip.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? I\\u2019ve been stripping?!\\u201d Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, \\u201cOh yeah, I totally did that, but don\\u2019t know what it was for.\\u201d Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you\\u2019re amazing and I didn\\u2019t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, \\u201cWhat, do you think you want my hat back now?\\u201d He\\u2019s saying this like he\\u2019s not going to give it to me and I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m like whatever. I hadn\\u2019t thought of it and it\\u2019s not a big deal to me. We\\u2019re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We\\u2019re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he\\u2019s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it\\u2019s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it\\u2019s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I\\u2019m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he\\u2019s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to be a part of any of them. They all seem so unstable!\\u201d\"],[\"There are three distinct parts to this dream. The first part I remember is a gathering of a lot of women - at least 25 of us. It\\u2019s a retreat and it\\u2019s towards the end of the retreat. It\\u2019s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She\\u2019s been doing a lot of the teaching. I\\u2019ve been in the mix, too. I\\u2019m not a participant, but I\\u2019m there. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m helping out with the retreat or not. She\\u2019s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They\\u2019re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She\\u2019s giving them a speech, more or less, that\\u2019s along the lines of: \\u201cOkay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.\\u201d I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn\\u2019t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else\\u2019s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I\\u2019m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they\\u2019re all complaining. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cDid you not learn anything from what we just did?\\u201d They\\u2019re all holding hands with each other. They\\u2019re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I\\u2019m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that\\u2019s what I should be doing because I\\u2019m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don\\u2019t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave their clothes where they are and I walk away from the clothesline and I walk away from the whole retreat. I am thinking that I need to leave them all to their own devices because they don\\u2019t get it. That\\u2019s the thought going through my head. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m in conversation with my ex-husband about our daughter. It\\u2019s my time with them - we\\u2019re still sharing custody and visiting time. My son is there and he\\u2019s closeby - he\\u2019s with me. But my daughter is not there and I\\u2019m asking my ex where she is. He tells me, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s at her friend Gus or Gum\\u2019s house.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWho is that? I don\\u2019t know who that is.\\u201d He tells me that he is a teammate of hers. She\\u2019s apparently playing soccer and this is her teammate. But she\\u2019s 12 and this boy is a little bit older - that\\u2019s the impression I get. I\\u2019m starting to get pissed off and scared because I don\\u2019t know this kid\\u2019s parents and they live in another county. There\\u2019s a little map flashing before my eyes and the place they live is highlighted and flashing and it\\u2019s far away from where we are - at least a day away by car. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I don\\u2019t know this kid, I don\\u2019t know his parents, I haven\\u2019t talked with my daughter in a long time and I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing and I don\\u2019t trust that she\\u2019s safe. I start yelling at my ex, telling her he can\\u2019t just let her go to places that he doesn\\u2019t know the parents or the situation just because she wants to hang out with a boy, essentially. He doesn\\u2019t get it. His face turns stone cold. I\\u2019m trying to keep my voice even and level. But the more he grey rocks what I say, the louder and frustrated I get until I\\u2019m just yelling at him. I\\u2019m so disgusted with him. His dad is the one driving my daughter down and back and he\\u2019s there. I\\u2019m just as mad and frustrated at him. It feels very much like they\\u2019re stonewalling me and taking my daughter. But they're putting her at risk is what I feel. I'm panicked and so upset but getting no answers from them. I\\u2019m asking them where this boy lives because I want to go pick her up, but they won\\u2019t tell me. So the dreams shifts again and I retain the panic. In the next shift of the dream, I\\u2019m hanging with some friends - some are from high school, some are from this time - other instructors I\\u2019ve met at the pole studio. We\\u2019re all outside. It\\u2019s a bright, beautiful sunny day. We\\u2019re walking down a paved path - it\\u2019s available for a lot of people to walk on. It\\u2019s me and another girl and another guy. Other couples are around me as well. We\\u2019re all walking and there\\u2019s space between the other couples and me and this girl and this guy. I\\u2019m noticing that they\\u2019re starting to hit it off. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m jealous or frustrated. I\\u2019m having an emotional reaction, but not sure. Some of it is that panic has carried over from the last part of the dream. Again I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou guys don\\u2019t really know each other. It\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up right now.\\u201d We all stop walking. We end up at some sort of grassy area. The couples have split off - they have their own blankets. This guy and this girl - there\\u2019s a sense that I know who they are, but I\\u2019m not seeing who they actually are - they split off, too. Everyone gets under a blanket. I\\u2019m watching and can tell that these two are hooking up. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know each other!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at this through the lens of us being in quarantine and I\\u2019m thinking it\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up with someone you\\u2019ve just met while we\\u2019re in this quarantine. I\\u2019m just really concerned again. Then somebody passes out bathing suits to all of the women. I\\u2019m watching as all of the women and all these couples put these bathing suits on. They look different on every single woman. It\\u2019s very interesting to see how it\\u2019s the same cut of bathing suit bikini, but looks so different on every single woman. I have one, too, and am trying to put it on. But I\\u2019m putting it on over my clothes and I don\\u2019t understand why I\\u2019m doing that, other than the thought going through my head is that I want the added layer of protection. Everybody else seems a little bit carefree and somewhat nonchalant about the situation we find ourselves in. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve hooked up with their person and it\\u2019s them and their person and they\\u2019re okay. But I\\u2019m by myself. I\\u2019m watching all these couples and the ones that have been together I\\u2019m like, \\u201cyeah okay, they\\u2019re good,\\u201d but the ones that haven't been together, I\\u2019m totally horrified and that sense of not just panic, but a little bit that I\\u2019m in the wrong frequency goes through all the dreams - that I\\u2019m just not in the right timeline. That sense, I woke up with and still feel.\"],[\"I am with a friend but I\\u2019m not actually sure who it is - there\\u2019s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we\\u2019ve known each other for a while. We\\u2019re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don\\u2019t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We\\u2019re walking through a town. We\\u2019re on the streets of the downtown area. It\\u2019s dark - like night time or really early morning. We\\u2019re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that\\u2019s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she\\u2019s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it\\u2019s a room off to the side. I\\u2019m so happy to see her. She\\u2019s such a beautiful soul. And she\\u2019s so happy to see me. She\\u2019s showing me some of the pieces she\\u2019s working on. It\\u2019s an interesting interaction because there\\u2019s this air of how much we love each other and she\\u2019s so excited about all her work and I\\u2019m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They\\u2019re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there\\u2019s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it\\u2019s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she\\u2019s found a different coffee shop. So we\\u2019re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It\\u2019s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I\\u2019m happy to see her, but also not. There\\u2019s a little bit of, \\u201cOh no, I don\\u2019t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me\\u201d (which is what happened in real life). So I\\u2019m kind of glad to see her, but there\\u2019s also part of her that\\u2019s also sort of ignoring me. She\\u2019s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I\\u2019m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I\\u2019m with - the one who I still don\\u2019t know who it is - says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.\\u201d So, we\\u2019re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There\\u2019s a bunch of people at it. They\\u2019ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\\u2019m on vacation. I\\u2019m not doing any business. There\\u2019s no meetings.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWell you know this is a BNI meeting.\\u201d The way these things work is if you\\u2019re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn\\u2019t know that was happening, but it feels like that\\u2019s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that\\u2019s gotten us in the mess we\\u2019re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh D\\u2019s here! Great!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my fucking god, get me out of here now.\\u201d He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn\\u2019t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, \\u201cEh.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw.\\u201d He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cFuck, you can\\u2019t even be neutral. You can\\u2019t even control your body. You\\u2019re in my damn space and I don\\u2019t even want to be here!\\u201d I still haven\\u2019t had any food or coffee, so probably I\\u2019m \\u201changry\\u201d - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don\\u2019t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I\\u2019m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it\\u2019s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it\\u2019s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I\\u2019m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There\\u2019s a pier off to my right. There\\u2019s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He\\u2019s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He\\u2019s also writing stuff out in the sand that they\\u2019re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren\\u2019t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I\\u2019m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There\\u2019s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I\\u2019m noticing them as I\\u2019m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I\\u2019m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party, it\\u2019s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I\\u2019m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m feeling like, \\u201cUh, I don\\u2019t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn\\u2019t feel super good.\\u201d Fear of judgment and all that. I\\u2019m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we\\u2019re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll be back.\\u201d I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019ve never seen before, but it's a house that\\u2019s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I\\u2019m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I\\u2019m at her house, which I don\\u2019t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They\\u2019re talking to me about planning how they\\u2019re going to remodel parts of their house and how it\\u2019s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they\\u2019re going to earn it. I\\u2019m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he\\u2019s one of those ages). They\\u2019re showing me how they\\u2019re going to do it. They\\u2019re really, really friendly - it\\u2019s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there\\u2019s different ways. I\\u2019m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, \\u201cWell, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.\\u201d So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It\\u2019s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.\\u201d Then my friend is like, \\u201cWell I need you to come and do this thing with me.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I\\u2019m feeling torn because I don\\u2019t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there\\u2019s all these crappy t-shirts like you\\u2019d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They\\u2019re on one of those round racks and I\\u2019m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re doing all these things, come do this with me.\\u201d A second friend from the party comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGuess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.\\u201d She\\u2019s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that\\u2019s where I worked. It\\u2019s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.\"],[\"This dream really did not want to stick. I kept trying to call it back and it wouldn\\u2019t come even though I could feel the felt sense of it. There was something good going to happen if I could just get the right thing to happen - if I could just be lucid enough in the dream and follow the thread of what felt good, then something good would happen. I was in a large dance hall and the windows were floor to ceiling with curtains on either side. There\\u2019s bleachers. I\\u2019m sitting on the bleachers and take my shoes off. The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they\\u2019re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don\\u2019t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren\\u2019t there. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you\\u2019d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - \\u201chey go look over there, there\\u2019s all these shoes.\\u201d There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn\\u2019t progress through the dream if I didn\\u2019t find them. And I didn\\u2019t.\"],[\"Dreams are getting weird...I\\u2019m in this dream, but I am an observer. I do not have a body, I am not taking up any space, I am just watching it all happen. There is a black man and his two daughters. He is showing them how to ride trains for free because they\\u2019re really poor and they don\\u2019t have money for a ticket. So he showed them how to get on these subway trains for free and ride where you need to ride it. They\\u2019re riding on the outside of the train. His daughters are maybe 9 and 11 or maybe 11 or 14. I\\u2019m watching them. I\\u2019m not even on the train. I\\u2019m watching from outside the train. This train is underground, kind of like a subway because there are walls around it and me. They\\u2019re on this train and it\\u2019s going in one direction. They are on a trip and traveling cross-country. But his daughters get very fearless and bold. They decide to do train hopping and take what he\\u2019s taught them and get on any train they want. Sure enough, they\\u2019re on this train and they see another train passing them and going in the opposite direction. They were heading one direction because they were heading across the country and then the daughters hop trains and the father is upset. He says, \\u201cHey don\\u2019t do that, now we\\u2019re going in the wrong direction plus you could kill yourselves.\\u201d But it\\u2019s too late. The daughters are already on another train, so he has to hop it and get on with them, so he doesn\\u2019t lose them. So he gets on this other train. Now they go from being on top of the train down inside the train where there\\u2019s other people. There are all kinds of other people on this train. All kinds of ethnicities, races. It\\u2019s a mix of white, black, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander - everybody and all kinds. They\\u2019re all quirky people. They have their own idiosyncrasies. They\\u2019re each working through some sort of story - they\\u2019re living their own personal story out on this train and they\\u2019re kind of interacting with each other, but it\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re bouncing off of each other. The interactions aren\\u2019t particularly conscious. It\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re each doing their own thing. They run into each other and it\\u2019s sort of like a pinball where their actions, thoughts and stories are mainly about themselves, but they bounce off each other and have an interaction. In particular, there\\u2019s a couple that I can see and am following - a white man with a mustache and shorter hair and with his partner/wife - I can\\u2019t tell what kind of relationship they\\u2019re in. The dad and the two daughters are in the mix now. I\\u2019m watching them. Now that the direction they\\u2019re going has now changed completely, he\\u2019s realizing they need clothes and supplies and food. They\\u2019re going around the train and getting some supplies. Everybody is pretty friendly and are like, \\u201cYeah, we all don\\u2019t have a lot, but here I have this one coat or this shirt.\\u201d It seems like everybody on this train doesn\\u2019t have a lot of money, but they do have some resources. Everything they\\u2019re offering up has been well-used. But the daughters need clothes, shoes and food. And the dad\\u2019s like, yeah I could use a jacket. So everybody is offering what they\\u2019ve got. Then back to this one man with this woman. He\\u2019s wearing a flannel shirt that\\u2019s opened and jeans with rips. He knows what he\\u2019s wanting to do - he\\u2019s very focused. The train has now gone out from a tunnel to outside. I can see outside now. I\\u2019m in the train and outside the train, both simultaneously. I\\u2019m observing what\\u2019s happening in the train and outside of the train. So the train is outside and stops suddenly. Part of the tracks go through this person\\u2019s yard. Their yard looks like a big farm. The train dead stops in the middle. My thought when I see that is, \\u201cUgh, how inconvenient to have a train in the middle of your front lawn. Then all the people start getting off the train. They\\u2019re milling about the lawn of this farm. It\\u2019s a big property. Then some of the people are going into the farmhouse and I\\u2019m watching them wondering, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s the owner of this house? They're probably not going to like this.\\u201d Then that one man and the woman go into the house and they start looking for supplies. I see this other man, he\\u2019s a big beefy burly man, almost like a bodybuilder type guy. He\\u2019s with a woman, too, and she\\u2019s really big, maybe 200lbs and she has a backpack on. They see that the farmer has a horse that\\u2019s in the front lawn and they climb up on the horse to ride it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that horse\\u2019s back is going to break. That\\u2019s too much weight - bodybuilder, large woman plus backpack.\\u201d I see the horse walking, then trotting, then galloping. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d The horse is fighting the whole time. The farmer comes out and yells at them to get off his horse, which is something I would have done. But the thought that registers in my brain is: \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe they know how to ride a horse.\\u201d With the whole bodybuilding persona, it doesn\\u2019t seem like something they would know how to do. Then I go back to the inside of this house where this other man is - the one with the mustache. He has found jewelry making supplies and he\\u2019s making jewelry. It\\u2019s gorgeous, raw stones and he\\u2019s soldering the silver. He\\u2019s making a pendant. It\\u2019s not his supplies, but the farmer\\u2019s that he found in this house. I can see this happening through a sliding glass door. Then I am inside the house. This black man and his daughters are in there, too, and they\\u2019re rummaging for food. The other people on the train are milling about, too, doing all kinds of things. The train has stopped because it\\u2019s stuck. But eventually, you hear the conductor yelling, \\u201cHey, the train is back together. You need to get on. We\\u2019re going to go. We\\u2019re going to continue on.\\u201d So some of the people get back on the train, and some of the people are like, \\u201cNo, we like it here. We\\u2019re going to stay here.\\u201d (not necessarily in the farmhouse, but in this area). The train continues on in its direction while another train passes in the opposite direction. I think the black man and his daughters get on the train going the opposite direction so they can get back to where they had originally set out to go to. Then the dream switches completely. Again I am an observer. I\\u2019m watching women I know - they are performers. It\\u2019s kind of like a circus. There\\u2019s a big tent. They\\u2019re in a dressing room in the back where everyone is talking. There\\u2019s lots of love and connection between all these women. They\\u2019re definitely family, they get along, some are actually blood family. It\\u2019s not a hierarchy because not just one person is in charge, but there is a synergy with one person who directs things. Things get done around her direction, but nobody has more or less power than her. This is fascinating for me to watch as she gives directions about how to do their show. It\\u2019s not actually directions. She\\u2019s asking who wants to do what - \\u201cDo you want to do this part of the show? Are we going to take a break?\\u201d Then there is an announcement that this man is coming in and he\\u2019s going to be a guest spot and do part of the show. I see all of the women perk up. Some are like, \\u201cWell, is he handsome?\\u201d But I see the woman who is the glue and directs things. She gets that look in her eye like, \\u201cHmm, I don\\u2019t know if I trust this.\\u201d So everybody leaves the dressing room and goes out in the circus tent area where there\\u2019s definitely a crowd of people watching. They\\u2019re watching a show in a huge copper bathtub, big enough for multiple people to be in. The man comes in and he\\u2019s going to do his show in the bathtub. It reminds me of synchronized swimming and people who act like mermaids, so you can watch through the glass as they do this show under the water. So this man is doing all of it, but normally the show is done completely naked - all of the women are completely naked while they do it. He\\u2019s doing it with his clothes on and the women are wondering, \\u201cWhat is going on? Why is he doing it that way?\\u201d So the woman who directs and has some good mothering energy goes into the tub to do part of the show and she\\u2019s naked as usual. The man who has all of his clothes on has an assistant and she has all her clothes on, too. The woman that is directing things goes in and does her part. You can tell there is tension and this attempted shaming that she\\u2019s in there naked. It\\u2019s totally beautiful to watch her, but then there\\u2019s this man and this other woman who have their clothes. They look so weird, they can barely move because their clothes are dragging them down, especially in contrast to the woman who\\u2019s naked. Some of the other women come in and start doing the dance in the water and they\\u2019re naked. But then you see some sort of official come in and say, \\u201cYou have to wear clothes now.\\u201d So they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, we have to put our clothes on.\\u201d They do put their clothes on. The person who says, \\u201cyou have to put your clothes on\\u201d is the husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing things. He says it because he says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t dance with that man naked,\\u201d because now in the show, they\\u2019re supposed to dance together. The husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing the show is feeling jealousy or protectiveness and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t dance with him without your clothes on. You all put your clothes on.\\u201d So there\\u2019s this dynamic of men coming in and directing the woman and their dancing, nakedness, wildness and freeness.\"],[\"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I\\u2019m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She\\u2019s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She\\u2019s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I\\u2019m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we\\u2019re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it\\u2019s men. We\\u2019re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila\\u2019s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We\\u2019re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it\\u2019s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I\\u2019m watching and I see Aila\\u2019s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it\\u2019s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I\\u2019m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it\\u2019s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it\\u2019s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It\\u2019s not quite a break wall because it doesn\\u2019t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I\\u2019m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He\\u2019s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They\\u2019re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It\\u2019s okay that they\\u2019re playing. I don\\u2019t have any concerns about who they\\u2019re playing with. I think that because I\\u2019m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They\\u2019re definitely working something out. I\\u2019m not concerned about that part at all. I\\u2019m just concerned that both children don\\u2019t drown. I\\u2019m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They\\u2019re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they\\u2019re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They\\u2019re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they\\u2019re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I\\u2019m watching this happen and by this time I\\u2019ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I\\u2019m concerned and don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. She says, \\u201cThe train was raided by these police officers.\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get to it. We weren\\u2019t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.\\u201d I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She\\u2019s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she\\u2019s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it\\u2019s the thing that she\\u2019s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a guy I know. In the dream, we\\u2019re together, maybe we\\u2019re dating. I have this feeling I\\u2019m trying to prove myself to him and that feels really gross. We\\u2019re together and he\\u2019s wanting to go from one island to the next. So we\\u2019re on the Big Island and trying to get to Maui. At least that\\u2019s the impression I have. But the setting doesn\\u2019t look like the islands I know. We are driving in a car and there's a baby in a car seat - I think it\\u2019s mine and his, but I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m trying to tell him how in the past, I had island hopped. I would take my car and drive it down this really long stretch of road and catch enough air to hop the channel - a very wide expanse of ocean between the islands. Somehow I\\u2019m trying to convince him I can do this. He\\u2019s very harsh. I\\u2019m trying to live up to expectations. It\\u2019s very strange because that is definitely not how I roll in real life. I\\u2019m driving the car to the place where I know we can catch enough air to ocean hop. We get to the end of the road - to this spot where I know I\\u2019ve done it before. There\\u2019s a huge wall rising up out of the ocean. It\\u2019s painted in colors of blue to look like the ocean. There\\u2019s actually ocean that comes over the top of it - water has been pumped over the top to make waterfalls. I\\u2019m shocked because it was definitely not there before. The times I had tried it, the road went off the edge of a cliff so you could catch some air. Now the road goes down and hits a shore. There's no way to catch enough air to get off of that and over this huge wall that\\u2019s now in front of us. I can feel that he is questioning me and what I\\u2019m telling him. He\\u2019s suspicious. I take the car and I get down to the bottom and see this is not happening. So I turn the car around. We head off to the right to an old dive bar. I say, \\u201cMaybe there\\u2019s somebody over there who can help us who\\u2019s done it before.\\u201d So we park and we go in. It\\u2019s totally dimly lit and smoky. The food is greasy and gross. We sit there and the woman who comes up to take our order reminds me of a friend of mine. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yea, I\\u2019ve figured out how to get over that wall. It takes certain skills and some special tools.\\u201d She\\u2019s also mad about something. She\\u2019s got revenge on the brain. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you how.\\u201d There are other people in this dive bar/diner breakfast place. They all look seedy and suspicious - rough around the edges. As this woman is talking to us, she\\u2019s super bitter and resentful. I can't tell if it\\u2019s because of where she works or the people she works with or what, but she\\u2019s definitely holding a grudge. She has her apron on and she\\u2019s holding her little notepad in her hand. We are trying to order some food and the baby is with us and sitting in its car seat - so strange because I can\\u2019t tell if this baby is mine or ours or what, but we\\u2019re taking care of it. She offers to go with us to get the car over the wall so we can go from one island to the next. It\\u2019s really important for us to go to Maui because I get the sense that it is a place where we will be free. So, she offers to go with us. Her and the ugy I\\u2019m with start hatching a plan and it\\u2019s kind of violent. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019ve gotta blow up this part of the wall.\\u201d So one of us has to swim under the waterfall part and plant these little grenades down low in the sand. I\\u2019m down iwth all of this, but another part of me is like, \\u201cthis is fucking insane. All of it is insane. What is going on?\\u201d We all get into the car. At this point other people have joined in on the plan. They are her people. So she is following us with these other people in a car, or maybe we\\u2019re following them. We\\u2019re heading back to that part where the road stops down near the ocean, but you can see the wall. She gets in the water with a knife and what I assume are grenades or something. A bunch of other guys she's with - her crew - get in the water. I see the guy I\\u2019m with get in the water. I\\u2019ve got the kid in the car. Then I\\u2019m also going in the water. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s watching the kid at this point. We all swim out to this wall. You can tell this wall was built by humans and it\\u2019s a tactic to keep us fenced or hedged in. Now all of us are totally intent on blowing up this wall. There\\u2019s still an edge of violence, anger and rage coming off the guy I was with. But now you can tell it\\u2019s a suicide mission for the woman and she\\u2019s giving up her life for this. Her crew - all the dudes she\\u2019s with - same. This has turned into some sort of \\u201cfor the greater good\\u201d cause. I\\u2019m treading water and don\\u2019t know how this is going to work. At this point I\\u2019m mostly watching because I don\\u2019t have an active role in bringing this down. I\\u2019m not quite sure what my partner is either, but he\\u2019s got an important part to play. All I can see is that the woman has died under the water. Before she dives under she says, \\u201cI hope this serves,\\u201d or something like that. I watch her dive under the water and she puts the grenades down at the bottom. The wall explodes and she explodes - actually, she disintegrates in front of me. Somehow I\\u2019m fine even though I\\u2019m in the water - I\\u2019ve backed up enough that this isn\\u2019t going to affect me. I watch a portion of the wall come down. Then me and the guy I\\u2019m with swim back to the car and we back way up the road in the car. He\\u2019s still like, \\u201cthis better work\\u201d and he\\u2019s going to blame it on me if it doesn\\u2019t. At this point, \\u201cI\\u2019m like, dude, you guys did all that crap. If it doesn\\u2019t work then I don\\u2019t know what to tell you.\\u201d But the urge to be free is really strong for both of us, so we\\u2019re both willing to try anyway, even though he seems completely ready to scapegoat me for whatever doesn\\u2019t happen. I\\u2019m a little pissed off about all that. So we back the car up all the way up and get as much speed as possible and somehow manage to launch over the broken part of the wall and make it to Maui. At this point, the dream completely shifts. Now I\\u2019m on the top of a hill. There\\u2019s a sports store where I\\u2019m working. Down below is another type of store - it looks like a UPS shipping center warehouse or something like that. To the left of that is a gym. I think I\\u2019m working in the sports warehouse store. I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie, but in some of the pictures, I\\u2019m naked from the waist down and in some of the pictures I\\u2019m completely naked and in some of the pictures I have all my clothes on. I have no idea what I\\u2019m doing or what that\\u2019s for, but apparently I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie to post on instagram. As I\\u2019m going back to work after this, I run into a friend - I think it\\u2019s an old classmate. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know you worked here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019ve worked here for a while. It\\u2019s a cool place to work.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cDid you know that our friend Levi works down at the shipping center?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t know he was down there. Sweet. One more person for me to sleep with!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, Kahenu works at this store with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I forgot that Kahenu was here. Awesome. One more person to sleep with!\\u201d This guy is pointing out to me all these people I know and I could sleep with. I\\u2019m totally stoked about it. Somehow, Jennifer Lopez shows up. She\\u2019s a fitness instructor for all the female employees. I\\u2019m watching her doing a workout and they\\u2019re all doing it with her. They\\u2019re all badass, totally kicking ass, covered in sweat from head to toe. They do have all their clothes on, but it\\u2019s bootie shorts and sports bras. For part of this workout, J Lo is in roller skates and some of it is coordinated because some of it is part of a music video. I watch them all working out, dripping sweat. Then she gets her roller skates and starts skating down the hill because this sports warehouse is at the top of the hill. All of these women, at least 25 if not more, are following her down the hill as part of this music video. I\\u2019m observing all of this and not making contact with all the people. I see Levi coming in and out of the building, but I don\\u2019t actually talk to him. I see Kahenu and start walking behind him. He turns around me and sees me and his eyes glaze over then get wide and he actually sees me, then he gets suspicious looking again. He turns around and keeps walking. I\\u2019m behind him and like, \\u201cHey you know me! Don\\u2019t pretend you don't know me.\\u201d Then the scene shifts one more time. I\\u2019m in a home, but now I\\u2019m in the observer role. I\\u2019m watching this woman who is pregnant with her third kid interact with the husband. The husband could give two fucking shit about her or the kids. She is trying so hard to engage him. She is being a super good mom. Her two little boys are probably 4 and 6 or maybe 5 and 3. They\\u2019re a little bit of a handful. She\\u2019s maybe 8 or 9 months pregnant and definitely putting on a persona of the cheerful, happy, bubbly wife. She\\u2019s also really, really short, maybe 4\\u20198 or 9 - not that much taller than her kiddos. Her husband is going off to work and she\\u2019s saying, \\u201cHey, have a nice day, honey!\\u201d His face is glued to his phone. I can tell that he\\u2019s on the phone texting a mistress or scrolling through pictures of other women. I have judgment around it. I\\u2019m also watching her trying to keep him engaged, and he\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYup, yup, going to work, bye, see you later.\\u201d I see him leaving and her trying to engage her two sons in play and learning like a home or unschooling situation.\"],[\"The felt sense of this dream is sticking with me - a panic from the coronavirus. I\\u2019m in my home, but it doesn\\u2019t look like the one I grew up in. It\\u2019s warm out, like Spring. The ocean is around in the background - I can hear it. My parents are there along with a dad and two sons who I grew up with. This dad was my dad\\u2019s business partner when my dad opened a restaurant. He was a chef and a referee for soccer. I\\u2019ve organized a talk because they\\u2019re trying to take away our rights. It\\u2019s a big community. What\\u2019s most striking is this place we\\u2019re having the talk is this open lawn - a communal area with grass, trees and shrubs - pink camellia blossoms - and white picket fences everywhere and white folding chairs where we are all sitting. I can feel how everyone needs to sit down and listen to this. I have an agenda and really wanting people to listen to this talk that\\u2019s happening, which I feel like I was a part of putting it together. My mom and dad are there and I have this feeling that I have the talk for them to listen to because I want them to grasp a point. I\\u2019m upset about something. The talk starts. Coronavirus is happening in the dream. We\\u2019re afraid we\\u2019re all going to be sick, but we\\u2019re wearing our masks, but sitting way too close to each other. People are complaining about not having their freedoms and liberties. The talk is going according to an agenda and people are wanting to say, \\u201cenough with this social distancing, isolating and taking away our rights.\\u201d But then Bob and his two sons come along with a bunch of other men and boys. They\\u2019ve all had the coronavirus and their mothers and wives have died. They\\u2019re up in front of us and trying to tell us what it\\u2019s like to have this and how devastating it is. Bob is saying that even though he and Sarah were divorced, Sarah came back from a trip to the UK with her partner and didn\\u2019t know she was sick. She was cleaning silverware at her job at the hotel before she came down with it and she and her partner died. Of course everyone who was at the bank where he had been and using the silverware got sick and some died and some didn\\u2019t. Both the boys got sick. They look pretty pale and wan. I hear one say it was the first thing he ever had to recover from. He\\u2019s not looking like his full healthy self, neither is the other son, and neither is Bob. They give their talk to all these people. There are a bunch of mothers in the crowd - moms with their babies and young children. My brothers show up at one point. They\\u2019re sitting next to me. I have my kids with me. There is so much community in this dream - people I know - and it\\u2019s shocking to hear Bob and his sons talk about it and see their sorrow at their loss. The dream goes from this outdoor area to a home. Part of the reason I was calling the meeting is I was protesting that my home was being taken away. Now my ex- father-in-law is in the dream and he\\u2019s trying to kick me and the kids out of the house. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have anywhere to go and the coronavirus is out there.\\u201d Then Bob and his sons who\\u2019ve all had it (we\\u2019re not sure if they\\u2019re contagious or not) need a place to stay. My parents offer them our place to stay. My brothers and I are trying to set up a place for them in the attic. The confusing part is all of the different people that come in - sometimes it\\u2019s my parents, sometimes my siblings, sometimes my ex, sometimes my kids, sometimes my friends including one of my friend\\u2019s from high school, Nani who I haven\\u2019t spoken to since we were Juniors - she\\u2019s one of the friends sitting near me. All of these people I know are coming and going, and sometimes I\\u2019m talking to my dad and sometimes I\\u2019m talking to my ex-father-in-law. Emotions are swirling a lot and I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m mad at everyone or happy to see them or scared for them. I know the feeling of upset I have for Bob and his two boys is big. I\\u2019m so worried about their experience and I know the fear is real. But I can\\u2019t tell how I feel about all the other people that keep showing up. They keep coming and going and playing these roles. The last part I remember is being in this attic of a home and listening to Bob and his sons talking about what it\\u2019s like to have the virus. I\\u2019m making a place for them to sleep - laying out bedrolls and sleeping bags. But I\\u2019m aware that I\\u2019m not wearing a mask and should probably be wearing a mask. The whole time I should have been wearing a mask especially when we had gathered for the community meeting. I\\u2019m very concerned about it. Bob speaks eloquently about what it\\u2019s like to lose your loved one because you didn\\u2019t believe that the coronavirus was real. That\\u2019s what I woke up with.\"],[\"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He\\u2019s very protective. I\\u2019m lying down on my back. I can\\u2019t tell where I am. There\\u2019s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I\\u2019m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I\\u2019m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I\\u2019m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it\\u2019s the time of coronavirus, people can\\u2019t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They\\u2019re gathered around me and I\\u2019m definitely still vulnerable because I\\u2019m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I\\u2019m telling them: \\u201cMy playlists are for pole classes. It\\u2019s not your normal CrossFit playlist.\\u201d They don\\u2019t care. They\\u2019re adamant that they get a workout. So, it\\u2019s either the man I\\u2019m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It\\u2019s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren\\u2019t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, \\u201cOkay, the winners get some of these ferrets.\\u201d During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s my kids or somebody else\\u2019s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I\\u2019m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they\\u2019re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn\\u2019t going to be what they thought. I\\u2019m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There\\u2019s this process I\\u2019m going through where I\\u2019m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they\\u2019re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can\\u2019t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they\\u2019re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I\\u2019m in the observer role. There\\u2019s a man and his son - I don\\u2019t know who they are. He\\u2019s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he\\u2019s very attentive. They\\u2019re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I\\u2019m not very neutral. I\\u2019m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it\\u2019s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he\\u2019s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, \\u201cWe need to take your son.\\u201d The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I\\u2019m fucking pissed. There\\u2019s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it\\u2019s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he\\u2019s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they\\u2019re basically not listening - they\\u2019re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man\\u2019s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that\\u2019s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with some friends - one or two are high school friends, but some are co-workers. I\\u2019m at a grocery store and we\\u2019re stocking shelves and cleaning up. We\\u2019re in the breakroom, too. We have to clean up the store to prepare it for the next day. There\\u2019s an interesting split between how much the men and women are cleaning up. The work is getting done, but the small details keep getting missed by the men and the women clean up after them. The dream shifts a little bit out of the grocery store to another room, maybe a home because there\\u2019s a home office and what looks like a home entertainment room. I\\u2019m watching a man who is a BDSM trainer and you can book sessions with him. There\\u2019s also a gorgeous super curvy black woman and it\\u2019s her birthday. Her husband has booked a session with this pornstar BDSM trainer. His name is King Noire. She\\u2019s so freaking excited and it\\u2019s so cute to see her exclaim, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m going to get hit with a paddle!\\u201d She\\u2019s really excited that this is her birthday gift and her husband is excited for her, too. Now we\\u2019re in what looks like an underground garage. She\\u2019s in some short shorts with a skirt over top and a regular top on. She\\u2019s walking down a ramp. There are other people getting ready for the scene. She\\u2019s so excited. She drops her purse and when she goes to pick up her skirt, it rides up. She\\u2019s wearing shorts, so you can\\u2019t see anything, but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my!\\u201d Her husband is standing behind her. You can tell she is nervous and excited at the same time, but doesn\\u2019t know which way to go with it. So she heads down the ramp and disappears into the darkness of this underground garage. I think this is perfect and she\\u2019s getting what she needs. I\\u2019m observing that part. Then I become part of the dream. Now it\\u2019s me and it\\u2019s my birthday. The whole tone of the dream changes. I\\u2019m with the person - but they\\u2019re not actually King, the BDSM expert. I can\\u2019t tell the person\\u2019s face, but they\\u2019re a tall, muscular and strong male. There are other men around. Whoever I am with, he and I are flirting and he\\u2019s telling me he\\u2019s going to treat me good on my birthday. We\\u2019re in the entertainment center part of the house. There\\u2019s a huge movie projector and a movie playing and there are some really comfy big seats. He\\u2019s sitting in one of them and I\\u2019m sitting on his lap. Now the dream starts to feel weird because I\\u2019m watching these other men in this room with women - they\\u2019re chasing the women. It reminds me of scenes where you see a satyr chasing nymphs. But there\\u2019s an edge of danger that it may not be consensual. I see someone in front of me cracking a whip. I turn to the person whose lap I\\u2019m sitting on and ask, \\u201cDid you bring one of those for my birthday?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh yeah, don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay!\\u201d He\\u2019s tending me to give me what I want and he has his own desires but is holding them in check - I can feel it. There\\u2019s another scene where things start to shift. Now instead of being in this entertainment movie room, all of a sudden we\\u2019re in a different room. I feel like a sacrificial offering. Now King is there in the room. He\\u2019s sitting in front of a computer at a desk and I can\\u2019t tell if he\\u2019s editing film. I can see out a bunch of windows to skyscrapers - a city. I come up to him, put my arms around him and tell him, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m going to be okay.\\u201d He clenches his jaw and starts to pretend to headbutt people three times. He\\u2019s really tense and he\\u2019s gripping the computer mouse. His whole body is really tense. I ask, \\u201cAre you worried about me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, and I know you\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d I say again, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time for me to head down to this underground parking lot. King is walking me down the ramp. I go from light into the dark. He has to stop at a certain point, and now it\\u2019s just me going forward from this point on. Now the dream gets a little funny. It\\u2019s still me. There\\u2019s a group of men - all white men and their faces are covered and they\\u2019re wearing all black. They kind of look like the Ku Klux Klan, but they have black instead of white. There is leather and chains and spikes and a lot of weapons - knives, rope and chains. This is the part where I pop out. Now I\\u2019m watching myself. They\\u2019ve formed a semicircle and I\\u2019m walking down into the middle. They grab this material with straps and loops for their hands. They come around me in a circle and take this material. They open it up - it was folded like an accordian. When they open it up, it circles around me. I am enclosed in this darkness - this black fabric material that looks like a set of bat wings, but their hands are through the loops and they are closing it. That\\u2019s the last bit of the dream I see - myself being enclosed in this thing. I can feel King or my Lover behind me is tense and not okay with it. But this is something I\\u2019m supposed to be doing - being a sacrifice. There will be pain, but it is consensual. But there is an edge of darkness as it is not a consensus between two people, but there are larger forces at play. King keeps acting like it\\u2019s out of his control.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know from waking life, but in the dream I recognize them as co-workers. We\\u2019re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they\\u2019re working. I work there, too, but I\\u2019m there on my day off. We\\u2019re talking. I\\u2019m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I\\u2019m barefoot and I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There\\u2019s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don\\u2019t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I\\u2019m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There\\u2019s some other way that I\\u2019m helping these co-workers. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an energetic helping or if I\\u2019m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They\\u2019re both younger women. I\\u2019m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn\\u2019t super clear. I just know I\\u2019m in the store with them and we\\u2019re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I\\u2019m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I\\u2019ve been hanging out with say, \\u201cOh, we have something for you.\\u201d All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we\\u2019re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There\\u2019s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don\\u2019t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, \\u201cWe have these shoes for you.\\u201d These boots are pretty incredible. They\\u2019re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I \\u2018m looking at these boots, the heel doesn\\u2019t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It\\u2019s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I\\u2019m so, so tall. I love them and they\\u2019re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I\\u2019m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re that tall in those shoes. That\\u2019s how tall you are. That\\u2019s who you are.\\u201d But I\\u2019m surprised. I didn\\u2019t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I\\u2019ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There\\u2019s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It\\u2019s an interesting mix because we\\u2019re in quarantine and we can\\u2019t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I\\u2019m thinking that for someone who\\u2019s never driven a huge tour bus before, he\\u2019s doing a pretty good job. I don\\u2019t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I\\u2019m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it\\u2019s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I\\u2019m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I\\u2019m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it\\u2019s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren\\u2019t going to tip him. I say, \\u201cYou have to tip him. That\\u2019s how this works.\\u201d I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it\\u2019s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I\\u2019m not stoked to be there. I\\u2019m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there\\u2019s stuff everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I\\u2019m somewhere I don\\u2019t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There\\u2019s definitely friction here. I\\u2019m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.\"],[\"I am in a large warehouse with racks and racks and racks of clothing, kind of like a Goodwill, but just clothing. I think some of the clothing is slightly used, some might be new. I\\u2019m with a couple other people - I\\u2019m not sure who they are, but there\\u2019s a friendship vibe. They\\u2019re searching for clothes to wear. One of them is a woman. She finds a green dress with multiple layers to it - a sheath dress part, then a lace overlay. The lace is really frilly with lots of ruffles and volume and not tailored - it\\u2019s more of an A-line. She puts it on. It looks fine on her. It looks alright. But I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, you always wear that kind of stuff. It\\u2019s not particularly form fitting. I don\\u2019t think it shows off your beauty fully. I don\\u2019t think it actually expresses who you are.\\u201d But she likes it, so she\\u2019s wearing it. Then there\\u2019s this group of other people. We\\u2019re standing at a rack where we\\u2019ve pulled the dress from and they\\u2019re watching us. It\\u2019s like the most purposefully diverse group of people - someone in a wheelchair, all ethnicities, skin colors, gender identifications and sexual orientations. I don\\u2019t know how I know this. I just know this. So it\\u2019s my turn and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll try this dress on.\\u201d The group is like, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t. That\\u2019s an ugly dress. It\\u2019s kind of like the same shit you always wear or think you want to wear. Don\\u2019t try it on.\\u201d But I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, I want to try it on!\\u201d I\\u2019m wearing a pair of jeans. I put the sheath part over my jeans. Already I think this doesn\\u2019t look good - Why would you wear a sexy form fitting sheath dress over jeans? But I\\u2019m just trying this on. The crowd is shaking their heads no at me. But I\\u2019m going to do this. They\\u2019re pretty adamant, like \\u201cCould you just listen to us already? We already know. Just don\\u2019t do it.\\u201d So then I pull on the second part of the dress. Of course it looks terrible. It\\u2019s a little bit frumpy with the ruffles and lace and sheer mesh. It doesn\\u2019t look good on me, it\\u2019s definitely not my style. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOkay, so that looks bad.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, okay, but I had to try it on.\\u201d So I take it off and I put my regular clothes back on. Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, there's a gigantic warehouse with racks and racks and racks of clothing I\\u2019m sure I can find something I like.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, please. I\\u2019m glad you tried stuff on, but now go explore more.\\u201d That part of the dream ends. Then I transition. Now I\\u2019m both the person in the dream and I\\u2019m also observing. I\\u2019m a younger woman who doesn\\u2019t really look like me, even the body shape is slightly different. I\\u2019m out in the desert - it reminds me of the Arabian Nights and a scene from the Disney Movie, Aladdin, because there\\u2019s a castle that looks like the Aladdin Castle with the big round spires, and then there\\u2019s desert everywhere. I\\u2019m with a young man. He has a turban on his head and a loincloth. I think he\\u2019s a young man, but he\\u2019s actually kind of ageless. He\\u2019s very clearly a medicine man. He knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s working magic. I\\u2019m with him. We\\u2019re on a quest to find liquid that comes out of this one tree when it\\u2019s blooming at a very specific time. It blooms for a couple of hours and the liquid is produced then and that\\u2019s the only time we can get it. I\\u2019m going with him. I\\u2019m not entirely sure why. I think there\\u2019s a beloved connection between the two of us and also I\\u2019m learning from him and also I\\u2019m his apprentice and helper. So there are multiple layers to this relationship. We head out into the sand - the desert. I know I\\u2019m working on something. I have my own little concoction that I\\u2019m making. We come to an oasis where there is this tree/bush. It looks like a tree, but like grape hyacinths - that purple flower that comes up in the spring and looks like grapes stacked on top of each other. The petals or grape looking things are pink. We\\u2019re at this oasis. The man is doing something at the edge of the water. I\\u2019m a little bit further back. I\\u2019m sitting in the reeds. I look over at this tree and I see it bloom. The liquid comes out and it looks like dewdrops on every single one of these grape-looking petals. There are no leaves, just this trunk and this conical shape. Then all of a sudden there is dew on every single petal. I know this is the substance we need for the elixir - the nectar. There it is! I call out to the medicine man: \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing it! Look! There\\u2019s the bloom. It\\u2019s happened.\\u201d He hears me and goes to gather a bunch of the nectar. I gather some of it, too. It is some of the sweetest stuff. I know I\\u2019m using it for my own potion and he\\u2019s using it for his, but I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m making. I just know it\\u2019s really important for me to make this and it\\u2019s important for him to make his concoction and it\\u2019s important for me to learn and watch the way he gathers and creates his concoction and for me to do my own. This is the part where the dream shifts a little bit. I become the observer. We leave the oasis and head into a jungle. He has a task for me/her. I\\u2019m watching outside of my body and notice I don\\u2019t look like myself - a younger woman with a different body type. She is muscular and thin, which is how I look, but slightly different. I see him tell her she has to climb a couple of trees to gather more ingredients. For whatever reason she\\u2019s doing it totally naked. I see her climb the tree and then she clutches her left or right butt cheek. I can tell she\\u2019s in pain, there\\u2019s a muscle spasm in that glute. It\\u2019s like foreshadowing or foreboding. She clutches it, then pats it and is like okay I\\u2019m okay, then continues on. All the tasks are very physical. One is climbing this tree. I think it\\u2019s a coconut tree. She comes down and then has to climb this other thing. She\\u2019s already checked in with herself - she had that twinge in the glute but she\\u2019s okay. But then I see her climb this one tree and she drops from a height into an athletic stance - like you would if you were an athletic person and practiced at this stuff. But as soon as she drops, I know, \\u201cOh no, that thing that was bothering her is going to flare up.\\u201d Sure enough she lands and I see her wince in pain. I can almost see the pain shoot up her back from that glute that was bothering her. There\\u2019s a younger boy around at this point. When she dropped from the tree, she dropped onto a wooden platform. This younger boy was working the platform. He\\u2019s pulling ropes that are part of a pulley system that is part of this platform she drops on. He watches her land. He is observing all this pain shooting up her back. She is crumpling to the ground with it and I know something went wrong. You can see that this young boy is realizing that he has to go find the master - the medicine man - to come help. I can see that he is thinking that he needs to help her. As the observer, I get the sense that there was a foreshadowing and now here we are at the major cruxe of things. Of course that\\u2019s where the dream ends.\"],[\"There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I\\u2019m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I\\u2019m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It\\u2019s showing up in flashes. There\\u2019s one part where I\\u2019m in an airport. I\\u2019m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It\\u2019s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don\\u2019t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It\\u2019s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I\\u2019m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There\\u2019s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I\\u2019m sorting of chatting with. I\\u2019m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I\\u2019m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that\\u2019s happened. I can\\u2019t find my sweater. We\\u2019ve landed and it\\u2019s time to disembark but I can\\u2019t find my sweater. I\\u2019ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we\\u2019ve landed and I\\u2019m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can\\u2019t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn\\u2019t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn\\u2019t look quite human. So, there\\u2019s this sense that I\\u2019m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don\\u2019t want to be because I don\\u2019t know where I am. I get on a tram. It\\u2019s more like a train that will take us to our destination. I feel out of place. I don\\u2019t know where I am - this place is new, this tram is new, I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going. Even though I\\u2019m part of this group, I don\\u2019t know all the people around me, It\\u2019s just a little uncomfortable and I feel disoriented. Then I come out of that part of the dream into another part where my ex\\u2019s presence is around. He\\u2019s not in the dream with me, but he\\u2019s been around. We\\u2019ve definitely been divorced. I\\u2019m agitated because he\\u2019s pulled more super controlling shit. I\\u2019m just wanting so badly to get away from this person, to get out from under his thumb, to not have to interact with him in any way. In the dream he does have the kids. It\\u2019s just me in the dream, but there\\u2019s a sense of him being around with the kids. I feel like I\\u2019m under surveillance as if he has cameras on me. I don\\u2019t even know where I am. I think it\\u2019s a house, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave the house and go out into town. There\\u2019s a building that is a retail shop. Things are sold out of it, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure what. I need to go there because there\\u2019s a desk that I\\u2019m trying to fix. What\\u2019s interesting is my dad shows up. The front of the retail shop is all these floor to ceiling windows. A lot of them have been broken - someone was throwing bottles or rocks. There\\u2019s glass everywhere in the entry area. I need to go in. I know this shop is owned by my ex and his father. There\\u2019s something about a desk that I need to get or repair. Or I need to get something from that shop. My dad is there and trying to sweep up all the broken glass. My dad is actually part owner of the shop, or maybe he owns the land that the shop is on. I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s super ineffective with his broom, so I just grab a broom and start sweeping. Between the two of us we get the glass picked up. The glass is in tiny, tiny pieces - not quite sand, but pebble size. It didn't break in big chunks - it broke like safety glass into little round pieces without sharp edges. The entryway is paved in cobblestone, so the glass is getting stuck in the grooves. We sweep up all the glass and I don\\u2019t know what we do with it. I go inside the retail shop and walk in through one of the broken windows rather than the door. There\\u2019s the desk that I need. I go to pick it up and move it and it just falls apart. I look underneath and the structure of it is crumbling. It\\u2019s like that really thin pressed board that cheap furniture is made out of and if it gets wet, it swells and disintegrates. It\\u2019s made of that stuff. I\\u2019m underneath the desk and trying to fix it. I ask my dad for help. He hands me a roll of duct tape. I try to duct tape it back together. I\\u2019m working on it and wondering why I\\u2019m trying to fix this desk. It\\u2019s my ex\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t want it, why am I fixing his shit? This desk is not going to provide what I need and is not the thing that I actually need. I come up from under the desk and there are other sturdy pieces of furniture made of real wood. I can see them and I\\u2019m comparing them to this desk. I have this sense of, \\u201cOh god, please make sure that my ex or his dad do not show up at this shop while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I have their permission, but don\\u2019t want to interact with them and their super controlling, contemptuous attitudes of disgust. I know I don\\u2019t want to be there when they arrive, so I\\u2019m trying to hurry.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s very cluttered. One of my brothers is with me. All of a sudden there\\u2019s a bunch of tiny little black bugs swarming. They all hatched at once and they\\u2019re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We\\u2019re both like, eww get them off. I\\u2019m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There\\u2019s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It\\u2019s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It\\u2019s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, \\u201cNo, no. Give me that rat. That\\u2019s our friend. That\\u2019s who\\u2019s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There\\u2019s more space between the rat and the cast. While I\\u2019m looking at this rat, part of me is like, \\u201ceww, it\\u2019s a rat,\\u201d and another part of me is like, \\u201cwell, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.\\u201d It\\u2019s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it\\u2019s a rat and it\\u2019s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I\\u2019m in a home. The part of the home I\\u2019m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It\\u2019s a square room with a round table in the center. It\\u2019s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he\\u2019s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he\\u2019s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frustrating, and I\\u2019m not entirely sure what we\\u2019re talking about. Then my ex shows up, or at least his voice does - I don\\u2019t actually see him. He tells me that he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with the kids. In the conversation with my ex father in law it was apparent that I was going to need to stay in the house that I\\u2019m in and I can\\u2019t move anywhere because it\\u2019s my only place of residence. So when my ex tells me he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with my kids, I\\u2019m pissed because I can\\u2019t get out of this house that I\\u2019m in. I\\u2019m super mad that they\\u2019re all in Hawaii. They\\u2019re not even from there. They\\u2019re just these white people who will just buy land and move there and my kids are going to be there without me to show them what Hawaii really is. I\\u2019m just mad that I\\u2019m stuck in this house. Somehow whatever agreement I\\u2019ve made with my ex father in law is keeping me stuck. Then I\\u2019m pissed at my ex because he just makes decisions about the kids without asking and just does whatever he wants.\"],[\"This dream has a deeper part where I know I was deeper in the dream realms or sleep. There\\u2019s a castle - this huge black maybe glass castle perched on the edge of a shoreline. It\\u2019s super dramatic with tall cliffs and ocean waves hitting the edge of the cliffs. Everything is dark - the ocean and the sky. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s dark because it\\u2019s stormy and cloudy or because it\\u2019s night time. The inhabitants of the castle, myself included, are all pegasuses - horses with wings. They kind of remind me of the cartoon from my childhood, \\u201cMy Little Pony,\\u2019 but it\\u2019s not light and joyful like that cartoon. It\\u2019s definitely darker, not sinister, just dark. There\\u2019s a couple of us flying pegasus horses. We are friends and we all have our own magical powers. We have things to do and are coming and going. It\\u2019s clear that I have a journey to take. I need to go somewhere and fly through the sky. The first part of this journey is me looking for another pegasus sister. She has gone down into the ocean to find something. I realize I need to do the same thing. There\\u2019s a greenish blue orb of light that is way, way deep below the waves and that\\u2019s where I need to go. I\\u2019m flying over the ocean waves looking for this sister and for my way in. Finally I dive into the water. It\\u2019s not cold and I can breathe under the water. It seems pretty normal. I\\u2019m swimming/flying through the water going really deep to find this blueish green light. I do eventually get to it. It takes a long, long time. I know there is something waiting for me and I don\\u2019t remember what it is when I wake up. Whatever the information is, I receive it and I come back up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m not supposed to go back to the castle. I know I am to continue this journey. So now I\\u2019m flying over the ocean. The dark has gone. It\\u2019s like when a storm starts to clear and patches of light come through. I\\u2019m heading to blue sky, sunshine and bright daylight. Clouds are breaking up. I\\u2019m flying out of the darkness and towards the sunny, lighter part. The water beneath me is changing from black, dark, inky and choppy waves and storm tossed waters to deep-dark blue of a darker ocean to greenish blueish turquoise and I think the water is getting shallower. Then I get to a point where there is more land. I\\u2019ve left the land with that castle, which was all dark and craggy with cliffs. The land back there was like black lava rock. As I approach this land and the water gets shallower, I can see shoals and places with coral reef that I can see, then little atolls - places with a little bit of land above the water. Then there is even more land above the water with palm trees. It\\u2019s more substantial and I can see that off in the distance there are homes - a neighborhood, actually. What strikes me is as I\\u2019m flying over this place, I see a wooden bridge. I land on the bridge and as soon as I land, I turn from pegasus to human. Then I notice the water around me is light green and really shallow. You can see algae growing on rocks and the water is really warm. It\\u2019s the brackish water of a hot spring. I can tell because of the smell that the water is from a hot spring coming up into the ocean. So there is a completely different kind of plant and animal life happening here. I get in the water. All of it is so heartbreakingly beautiful - the colors, the shape of the land and reef underneath, the rocks in the water that I\\u2019m walking in, the color of the water, the color of the plants, the flowers, the birds. There are hummingbirds flying in and out, getting the nectar from the flowers. There is so much life. Part of me is still that pegasus, but part of me is human now, because I turn into human as I walk over this bridge. There is a car parked on this wooden bridge. My first thought is, \\u201cHow did that car even get on there? The bridge does not seem wide enough for a car, only a human. And how is this wooden bridge holding up a car?\\u201d Then I see a woman sitting in the car. She\\u2019s taking in the view the way I am. I can tell she has parked her car there because it is healing for her to be in this gorgeous brackish hot spring ocean verdant full of life area. There\\u2019s just enough room for me to walk past the backend of her car and finish crossing this bridge. Her car is in the middle of the bridge. As I walk past the car and onto this second section of the bridge that takes me to land where these houses and this neighborhood are, I feel a shift happen. I leave that very mystical and magical place I had been in with the castle and the journey over the ocean and being a flying horse, and now I\\u2019m in human world. But I\\u2019m very aware that I\\u2019m actually a pegasus. It reminds me of the movie, \\u201cThe Last Unicorn,\\u201d where they turn the unicorn into a human girl and she has to wander the forest until she finds the rest of her unicorn sisters who were turned into white water ocean foam. I feel that way. I\\u2019m not human but I\\u2019m in human land. There\\u2019s another bridge. The bridges change. The first one was a wooden platform bridge and this next bridge is a swinging wooden bridge that dips down and swings when you walk on it. The reason for these bridges is that they are going over the water. There are little islands of land and I haven\\u2019t made it to solid land yet. Even then, there are ravines through the solid land. The land is not yet solid or flat. I can see past that it is flat at a certain point. I have to go over these bridges to get to that solid point. The problem is I come to a third bridge and I can see at the other end a sign that says No Trespassing. It\\u2019s not facing me - it\\u2019s facing the other way. My side of the bridge is open and in fact, everything has been open. But as I get to the end of the other bridge, it\\u2019s sort of like a dead end. There\\u2019s a house. Interestingly enough, there is a bridge parallel to this one that has chains on it that go across. The chains are very clearly there to keep people from crossing or passing. There are signs on that bridge saying you\\u2019re trespassing if you're on here. The bridge I\\u2019m on only has the trespassing sign at the end of it. I go to cross it and it stops at this house. Their backyard is really low, below me. Their house is up a bit on a hill. I can see into their garage area. There are people - two women and a couple of children - and they see me coming. They\\u2019re not poor, but it\\u2019s like the simple houses in Hawaii. They look at me like I\\u2019m not supposed to be there. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI know, but I\\u2019ve come from the other direction. There were no signs where I came from indicating that I couldn\\u2019t come this way.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome down off that bridge and come into our yard.\\u201d Somehow I figure out how to come off the bridge. The thing is I need to continue on because I know there is a house I need to get to that is much further down this path. At the end of this bridge is a road I was supposed to walk on and follow down. This road is on a place called Puako on the Big Island. This neighborhood looks exactly like Puako. In waking life, I lived there for a year with an ex-boyfriend and it was a beautiful place to live. There are palm trees, kiawe trees and sand. The ocean is to my left and land is to my right. I\\u2019m trying to get on this road and my ex-boyfriend is down at the end of the road at a house. There\\u2019s a house with a lot of people and a party going on. I\\u2019m trying to get there, but a part of me doesn\\u2019t actually want to go there. I\\u2019m wondering: \\u201cWhy do you want to go there? There\\u2019s nothing in that for you.\\u201d Because there is this stopping point - this gate - for me at the end of this bridge, I can\\u2019t go any further. The women in this house want me to get off the bridge and come down and be with them. I do. Everything changes in that moment to very mundane world. They tell me there\\u2019s a concert happening. I\\u2019m curious about the concert. It\\u2019s a typical party with smoking and drinking, like the college kind of party. But it\\u2019s the neighborhood with all ages. Somebody is going to come play music. There are three younger men who come near me. They try to engage with me and talk with me. I notice at this point that it\\u2019s cold. I have knit handwarmers and a knit hat on. The pair of handwarmers is a pair I actually own - they\\u2019re elastic and grey and I knit them for myself. There\\u2019s another pair of handwarmers in my pocket that I have as extra in case anyone needs. One of these young men is talking with me about how he\\u2019s cold. I say, \\u201cWell, why don\\u2019t you just put on a pair of handwarmers? I have an extra pair.\\u201d I look down and see that he has a knit pair on, too. In my mind, I think, \\u201cOh, he has a pair of handwarmers that I\\u2019ve wanted to knit. I just haven\\u2019t gotten to it yet.\\u201d He takes one off. So now he\\u2019s wearing one and he has another in his hand and he says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve lost one.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s in your hand!\\u201d This whole time he and his other hand are giving me this weird vibe. I really don\\u2019t want to be around them and I don\\u2019t want to be at this party. I\\u2019m looking for a wide open space where I can transform back into the pegasus and fly away. So I find this place in the yard, but it\\u2019s covered in lentils. It\\u2019s a mountain of lentils. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I can\\u2019t transform in this. I can\\u2019t even walk in this. It\\u2019s just a mess.\\u201d The ground is not solid. I can\\u2019t anchor in so I can transform. In the meantime, these three younger men have followed me. I\\u2019m trying so hard to get away from them. I don\\u2019t want anything to do with them, the party, the vibe of the neighborhood. I\\u2019ve gone too far into this reality. I can tell. I want back into the other one. Even if I could just get back across the bridge, back into that incredibly beautiful land and the bridge that was beautiful in its own way and there weren\\u2019t all these humans yet and it wasn\\u2019t packed in. I just want to get back there or fly back all the way back to the castle. But I can\\u2019t. I am so stuck and I cannot transform. I start to feel panic and anxiety because if that is my grounded space, I don\\u2019t want to be grounded there. I want the other more beautiful space. I wake up with panic, anxiety and grief because I can\\u2019t get back to that beautiful place and I can\\u2019t transform back into my pegasus self and I feel so stuck.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We\\u2019re outside and there\\u2019s a picnic table. I think there\\u2019s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We\\u2019re a part of that. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She\\u2019s hosting. I\\u2019m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They\\u2019re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it\\u2019s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There\\u2019s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I\\u2019m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I\\u2019m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they\\u2019re saying and learn from them. I think I\\u2019m really not welcome here. I don\\u2019t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I\\u2019m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It\\u2019s getting heated. They\\u2019re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I\\u2019m feeling all of these emotions. I\\u2019m pissed that that\\u2019s their reality and mine. I\\u2019m pissed that I feel like there\\u2019s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it\\u2019s more equal and fair for everyone. I\\u2019m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I\\u2019m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They\\u2019re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they\\u2019re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, \\u201cHey, I want you two to know that I\\u2019ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you\\u2019re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don\\u2019t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I\\u2019m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn\\u2019t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can\\u2019t tell if they appreciate what I\\u2019m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I\\u2019m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There\\u2019s a wooded forest behind me. There\\u2019s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I\\u2019m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they\\u2019re young. I\\u2019m a young adult in this place, or I\\u2019m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They\\u2019re playing and they\\u2019re hungry. They want something to eat. There\\u2019s a guy and in my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201coh my god, pedophile.\\u201d I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they\\u2019re playing. The kids say they\\u2019re really hungry and the guy is like, \\u201cWell, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019re all hungry. There\\u2019s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don\\u2019t even know where it\\u2019s plugged into. It\\u2019s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don\\u2019t want to take the meat from this guy because I don\\u2019t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He\\u2019s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he\\u2019s watching them play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t even watch them play.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it\\u2019s safer. I don\\u2019t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I\\u2019m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that\\u2019s right after me. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re talking about. We are in a different place. They\\u2019re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they\\u2019re in is devoid of trees. It\\u2019s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn\\u2019t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I\\u2019m talking to them and I\\u2019m checking in with them. But part of me doesn\\u2019t want to be talking about this with them because they\\u2019re not listening to me. They\\u2019re not hearing me. I\\u2019m not getting a say. I\\u2019m not getting to use my voice about this. They\\u2019re just telling me how things are. I\\u2019m annoyed because that\\u2019s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They\\u2019re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they\\u2019re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, \\u201cDo you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?\\u201d But they\\u2019re not listening and not open to it. I\\u2019m not saying anything. I\\u2019m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.\"],[\"Holy shit, this dream. And dreams within dreams. The deepest dream starts with me and all six of my high school classmates - two or three women and two or three men. They\\u2019re putting on a hula show for an audience. I don\\u2019t know who is in the audience. I haven\\u2019t learned it yet. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? How don\\u2019t I know this? Why didn\\u2019t you teach me? Out of all of us, I\\u2019m the actual hula dancer.\\u201d They are like, \\u201cWell, because you dance hula, you\\u2019ll be able to pick it up. But we\\u2019re going on stage now.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, right.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have the costume. Can you at least dance it for me at least once?\\u201d They find lei for me and costume for me. Interestingly enough, the costume is a bleached white pareo on the bottom. I don\\u2019t know what we have on top - I think nothing, just lei and lei on our head and kupe\\u2019e on our wrist and feet. I keep saying, \\u201cCan you show me the dance? Where in the lineup do I need to be for all of this?\\u201d We\\u2019re heading out onto the stage. The stage has maybe two inches of water on it and water all around it. The audience is on the other side of the water. We\\u2019re going to be dancing in the water. But I still don\\u2019t know the dance all the way, and none of my classmates are forthcoming. I get the sense that they\\u2019re bummed that I showed up and they were going to do the dance without me. They didn\\u2019t want me there. The reason they didn\\u2019t teach it to me is that they didn\\u2019t want me there upstaging them. This is such a strange thing in my mind. I don\\u2019t understand in my mind why as a class we\\u2019re presenting this hula to everyone and they\\u2019re trying to keep me out of it. Then the dream shifts to me being an observer. There is a dream oracle - he's like Edward - and a husband and wife. The wife looks like Julia Roberts. The man looks like a very stereotypical college professor type white man with the sweater and the khakis and loafers and glasses. This couple has come to see this dream oracle. They\\u2019re in a library - the dream oracle\\u2019s personal library with floor to ceiling books and lots of gold. It\\u2019s really ornate with all kinds of filigree style decorations of wall sconces and velvet chairs. It\\u2019s very opulent. The dream oracle is going to help them work through their dreams. The dream oracle explains to them how dreams work. You can see the man is very, very skeptical. But the wife is like, \\u201cOf course, it totally makes sense that dreams work this way - that they are hidden messages with multiple layers and that they come from other realms.\\u201d The husband is like, \\u201cWhatever, this is a bunch of bullshit.\\u201d This is where there is a dream within a dream. I watch them go into a dreamstate. In the dreamstate, the husband and wife are very lovely dovey. They\\u2019re in an open field with clouds. The husband just goes psycho. There\\u2019s another man there. I\\u2019m not sure who or what he is. The husband turns into a psycho as his wife watches. His true nature comes out in this dreamstate. He\\u2019s not just an animal, he\\u2019s cruel. This other man that shows up in the dream, he cuts his head off. The blood sprays all over the wife. The wife starts to freak out. This is where they\\u2019re in the dream together. So even though she\\u2019s freaking out, I can hear her say, \\u201cThis is just a dream, it\\u2019s not real.\\u201d The husband is trying to kiss her, but he\\u2019s very violent about it. He\\u2019s grabbed her hair. He\\u2019s covered in blood and he has a knife in his hand from when he cut the head off the other person in this dream. They come out of the dream together. They\\u2019re back in the dream oracle\\u2019s study. She\\u2019s horrified. I'm horrified. I\\u2019m looking at the husband and can tell that the dream completely revealed who he actually was. Maybe it was just a dream, but maybe it was the realest thing because now they can see who the husband is. He\\u2019s this violent guy, not the stereotypical well-spoken professor that he showed up as. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m no longer an observer. I\\u2019m back in my body. There\\u2019s a woman. She\\u2019s older than me. In this part of the dream, I\\u2019m younger, maybe 12 or 13 at least. She has a ton of books. She\\u2019s selling books. I\\u2019m outside with her. The books are on this round wooden table with a single leg in the middle. She goes door to door selling books and she\\u2019s showing me how to sell books to make money. She has dark hair that touches her shoulders. Her face is friendly. I get the sense she is not of this world. I\\u2019m trying to take in everything she says about selling the books, but I have this weird sense that things are not as they seem. I have my bicycle and there\\u2019s a little basket on the front. It doesn\\u2019t have any gears - it\\u2019s an old-fashioned bike with a banana seat. I\\u2019m putting some of the books in the front so we can go door to door and sell these books. I don\\u2019t know exactly what\\u2019s in them. She\\u2019s trying to tell me what\\u2019s in them, but I\\u2019m not remembering. So I\\u2019m younger in this part of the dream, but then the dream goes forward and now I\\u2019m probably 18-12. I\\u2019m college-aged. Now I\\u2019m with Josh, current lover in waking life, and his girlfriend. We\\u2019re all going to college together. He\\u2019s registering for courses. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m here because I\\u2019ve already been to college and don\\u2019t like college. I already have two degrees and don\\u2019t want to be here. What\\u2019s heartbreaking for me is that he\\u2019s with his girlfriend and they\\u2019re registering for classes together and I hear him say, \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s so many people here to meet and sleep with!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, I\\u2019m going to register for all my classes.\\u201d The thought crosses my mind, \\u201cWhy are you even here with him registering for classes? You\\u2019ve already got your degrees? And why are you registering for all of these undergrad courses. If you\\u2019re going to go back to school, get your PhD.\\u201d My response to that is like, I don\\u2019t want to do that. I don\\u2019t need a PhD. I don\\u2019t need to go to classes to get a PhD. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m here. I\\u2019m only here because I followed this guy here. And now he\\u2019s off and encouraging me to go meet a bunch of people. But I\\u2019m like, I don\\u2019t need you to tell me that. I don\\u2019t need your permission. I\\u2019m questioning why we\\u2019re even here together. I decide to write the whole thing off and try to make it my own. The dream shifts one more time. College is still part of it. Now my mom is here. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey honey, I got you some shoes. They were giving shoes away to low income people.\\u201d I guess I qualify as a low income person. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know if I need any shoes.\\u201d But I look. They\\u2019re these oxfords with the heel and front toe a dark maroon and the rest of the shoe is light pink. The colors go well together and the shoes are cute for low income. But I\\u2019m not expecting any shoes. I don\\u2019t need any shoes. I don\\u2019t feel like a low income person and don\\u2019t know why I need these shoes. They\\u2019re cute but I don\\u2019t actually want them. I wake up thinking that I don\\u2019t want any of this. I feel like I\\u2019m not following my path. I recall how the woman selling the books was telling me I need to do my own thing. I had this sense of frustration and my jaw was tight and tired as if I was grinding my teeth in the dream because I was playing catch up or doing something I didn\\u2019t want to do or I\\u2019m doing something that is not at my level. I get the sense that I\\u2019ve learned all this stuff and am repeating all of these patterns, but it\\u2019s time to move on and stop taking what\\u2019s offered to me as if there aren\\u2019t other things being offered to me or other things I could be taken advantage of. The feeling of being irritated stays with me.\"],[\"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people, but don\\u2019t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We\\u2019re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re heading, except that we\\u2019re trying to get out of where we are. It\\u2019s dark. If there is any lightning, it\\u2019s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we\\u2019re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don\\u2019t even know what they all do. We\\u2019re on the move. We\\u2019re all kind of dirty and grungy. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There\\u2019s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I\\u2019ve been practicing pole moves that she\\u2019s given me at home, but something happens and I\\u2019m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I\\u2019m watching. She\\u2019s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can\\u2019t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you\\u2019re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I\\u2019m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They\\u2019re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven\\u2019t touched a pole in weeks and don\\u2019t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it\\u2019s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It\\u2019s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I\\u2019m holding onto the handle to push out. I\\u2019m super disappointed because it\\u2019s so hard for me to do these moves because I\\u2019ve taken so much time off. I don\\u2019t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven\\u2019t been able to do what I\\u2019d like to do. I keep thinking I\\u2019m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I\\u2019ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back. That always bugs me.\"],[\"The dream starts with me in a car driving through rolling hills with big houses in the distance. It reminds me of a gated community. There\\u2019s lots of land. The parcels are huge and the houses are huge and there\\u2019s a lot of space between all of them. The hills are green and rolling. There\\u2019s a community center that we\\u2019re heading to. I get to this community center and home owners are coming and going. There are tables and chairs in one area and tv\\u2019s on the wall. Another area is like a nurse\\u2019s office. People are having their temperatures taken and getting shots. I think maybe they\\u2019re quarantining for coronavirus or giving vaccines. I\\u2019m not sure, but something like that is happening. I\\u2019m here. I get dropped off in this community center or clubhouse that the HOA owns. I\\u2019m watching people come and go - mostly white men. My ex father in law and ex show up. We have some interactions. I think I owe him some money and he wants the money from me. I don\\u2019t think I have everything I owe him, but I give him some. I\\u2019m reminding him we\\u2019re on a payment schedule and he\\u2019ll just have to wait for the rest. This part of the dream feels uncomfortable. I\\u2019m really not excited to see him or my ex. I don\\u2019t know what my ex wants. He\\u2019s just kind of there lurking. I\\u2019m really wanting to get away from both of them. They leave with some sort of promise from me that I\\u2019ll continue making my payments. I\\u2019m going from table to table in the clubhouse. I\\u2019m bored. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m waiting or why I\\u2019m still there. For some reason I have to stay because I\\u2019m in quarantine of some sorts. There\\u2019s a nurse that comes in and gets me. I go into her office. I\\u2019m sitting on one of those benches with the paper on it. She\\u2019s taking my temperature and drawing my blood. She\\u2019s very friendly and I actually feel comfortable with her. While I\\u2019m in there, some of the wives of the owners of these houses come in and they\\u2019re all very chatty Kathy\\u2019s and dripping in jewelry and expensive stuff. I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m wearing shorts and a tank top and slippers. Either the nurse or someone else who runs the clubhouse sees that I don\\u2019t look like the rest of them. She finds these strands, maybe 20 or 30 glass beads of all different colors. It\\u2019s a gorgeous necklace. She puts in on me and says, \\u201cNormally you\\u2019d have to pay for this, but I'm giving this to you. Don\\u2019t tell anybody I did.\\u201d It\\u2019s something she got from the gift shop part of the clubhouse. It\\u2019s this gorgeous necklace. She wraps it around twice and it looks beautiful on me. As soon as she does that, I'm suddenly no longer this misfit in the clubhouse, I\\u2019m queen. The energy changes. The other housewives, instead of just tolerating my presence, actually really begin to leave me alone in recognition of how much power I have. I get up and leave the nurse\\u2019s office and the clubhouse. I think I don\\u2019t need to be here. I go outside and there\\u2019s these huge trees - they look like oaks. There\\u2019s a storm, maybe a hurricane coming. Some of the husbands are trying to fortify the trees by raking the ground and moving the roots - trying to spread them wider so the trees will make it through this high wind. I\\u2019m watching them do this. Every time they try to move a limb or root to put it in the ground, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the trees. You can\\u2019t change how they\\u2019re going to plant themselves or be.\\u201d I keep watching this one husband raking the ground. I see him take a fallen branch and try to plant it in the ground. It\\u2019s got all this green moss over the top of it. I see him plant it then turn around and move away. I watch as the tree just picks it up and moves it to where it wants it to be. These trees keep doing that. They keep moving their limbs to where they want them to be. I keep shaking my head at these men who think they\\u2019re going to be able to direct where the trees grow.\"],[\"I am in a house. I don\\u2019t recognize the house. My mother is there. She\\u2019s kind, which is strange because she\\u2019s not usually. We are washing dishes together at the sink. The sink has a bunch of windows that we\\u2019re looking out of and there are a bunch of indoor plants hanging. The plants are beautiful. One of them is totally cool and looks like green pearls that hang down. There are other leafy ones. That setting is quite beautiful. The energy and vibration coming from the plants is amazing and healing. But I don\\u2019t feel very comfortable talking to my mom - I feel like she wants something from me and I\\u2019m not wanting to give it to her. She wants kindness from me, I think. I do not want to give her any compassion and kindness. I\\u2019m faking it though and going through the motions. There\\u2019s another piece of the dream where I am holding my son as a toddler, he\\u2019s maybe 2 or 3. I\\u2019m just loving on him and he seems pretty content. I put him down to play. We\\u2019re hanging out next to each other and both of us are doing the parallel play that toddlers do. Then all of a sudden, in my mind, I go, \\u201cOh my god, I\\u2019m an adult and yes, he\\u2019s content and happy where he is right there, but actually we need human connection.\\u201d I pick him up and his demeanor changes from very content and quiet toddler play to this absolute snuggly. His little body clings to me and he\\u2019s so much happier when I pick him up, love on him and include him instead of putting him down so he does his thing and I do my thing. It just dawns on me that I need to be holding him and carrying him. The connection between the two of us enlivens and blossoms and blooms. It\\u2019s so much better and deeper the second I pick him up and look at him in his face and eyes and he looks back at me. We\\u2019re connected and touching and present, really present with each other.\"],[\"I am with my lover - it\\u2019s not anyone I recognize from real life. He has tan skin and these piercing blue eyes. He\\u2019s not 100% white, he\\u2019s definitely a person of color. I\\u2019m in his bedroom. I\\u2019m naked. He\\u2019s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I\\u2019m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s mine, but I\\u2019m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It\\u2019s weird and doesn\\u2019t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It\\u2019s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It\\u2019s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I\\u2019m on my back. I can see my lover and he\\u2019s over me. He has a fork. He\\u2019s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?\\u201d This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s what I want, let\\u2019s go for that.\\u201d Then I do this weird thing while I\\u2019m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they\\u2019re scratching my skin with the fork. It\\u2019s like some very strange BDSM play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, this is what I want. Go for it. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But the lucid part of me is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?\\u201d I\\u2019m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I\\u2019m not enjoying at all. I\\u2019m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, \\u201cHere let me show you how to use your power now.\\u201d It\\u2019s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn\\u2019t. They say, \\u201cYeah okay, show us how.\\u201d They are truly wanting to learn. Somehow I have this queen-like presence, even though part of me sees this is not it. Then they are paid and they leave. Other people are showing up at the house, like we\\u2019re having a party. There are younger women - girls, maybe early 20s - who have shown up. I\\u2019m out on the back deck adjacent to the bedroom I was just in. The bedroom was huge with white gauzy curtains and the fancy netting over the bed. All the sheets and linens and carpet were white - everything was white in this room. I go out to the deck and some of these girls from the party show up. I\\u2019m switching out the rugs that were on the deck and right at the door to wipe your feet on. I\\u2019m showing these women how to pick the correct one that goes with the decor for this party.\"],[\"A lot of different parts to this dream. I\\u2019m with a friend, Vanessa, she was another white girl who would hang out with my hula halau. She wouldn't actually dance, but she lived across the street from my kumu\\u2019s house and she would watch the kids. She was a super humble woman and also a lesbian. She\\u2019s making dinner for us - she was very much a caretaker. She\\u2019s making a meal. I\\u2019m excited for it. But I taste it and it doesn\\u2019t taste good - something feels a little bit off about it. Somehow my friends from where I live now, Austin and Aila - they own a cattle ranch - are in the dream, too. There is food that Austin is contributing because they raise cattle for eating. There\\u2019s a table where Vanessa is making the food and white walls everywhere else. When Aila and Austin show up, we are in her house, which is gorgeous. It\\u2019s a two-story house with windows that go from the floor to the second story on one side. Her kitchen is big and beautiful. She\\u2019s upset about something. She leaves. Austin starts to tell us that she\\u2019s trying to kill herself - she\\u2019s been eating poison. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on. Why is she doing that? I keep asking him if I can go see her or find her. He says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t even find her.\\u201d He also says, \\u201cNo, leave her be. She wants to be alone.\\u201d I\\u2019m really worried about this. He says, \\u201cCome with me.\\u201d I go with him. Now there are other people around and I\\u2019m not quite sure who they are - it might be my siblings or other people we both know. He says, \\u201cWe have a job to do, so let\\u2019s give Aila her space. Let\\u2019s go do our job.\\u201d We go to a Home Depot or Lowe\\u2019s type of place with hardware and all the stuff you\\u2019d find at those kinds of places, as well as their garden center. He says, \\u201cEverybody grab a plant.\\u201d We all have to bring a plant with us. I have a plant in my hand and am feeling good about having this plant - a green lush hanging plant. Whoever else I\\u2019m with is young because it feels like Austin is directing us all. He\\u2019s in charge of directing us and giving us a task. So now all of us have plants. We\\u2019re filing through the checkout line with our plants. Then, Austin and the others start to recede. Even the hardware store starts to recede. What comes forward is what seems to be Lahaina in Maui. But it does not actually look like Lahaina, at least not the Lahaina I remember. I\\u2019m there and I\\u2019m on the street. My plant is gone now. I think I\\u2019m with one of my brothers. We are walking through the streets. I have this feeling of homesickness and longing. Even though the streets don\\u2019t look like Lahaina, the palm trees are there, the tall papaya trees the banyan, and the monkeypod trees are there. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood and walking down these streets with houses on them. At one point, there\\u2019s a really big hill that I need to walk up. Through all of this, my brother is with me. Then he disappears. I\\u2019m now wandering through a part of Lahaina that feels barren or industrial - it doesn\\u2019t feel beautiful like Hawaii is. My mom and dad show up and say, \\u201cHere, come with us. We\\u2019re going this direction.\\u201d They\\u2019re young - they don\\u2019t look like who I grew up with, but like who they looked like before kids. So I follow them to the end of the road. They get in this line. There\\u2019s a crowd of people and a house. The house is freaking beautiful. Suddenly, the Ko\\u2019olaus are there. At the end of this road, we\\u2019ve passed through this weird area that doesn\\u2019t look like Hawaii and now we\\u2019re at this house that does look like Hawaii. There\\u2019s an avocado tree growing in the yard. The backdrop is all these green luscious Ko\\u2019olau mountains. There\\u2019s a crowd of people all there to see the wizard that lives at this house at the end of the road where everything is lush and green. He has some answers for everybody. My parents say, \\u201cYou have to be very respectful. You may not be invited in. He may not talk with you.\\u201d Then I see the wizard come out of his house. He wanders up the side of his lawn. There is a thick grey wall between the neighborhoods and the magical place of green and avocado trees and lusciousness. I\\u2019m on the side of the wall that is the neighborhood side. The wizard invites two people in at a time to talk with him. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to go into my house this time. You can ask me questions out here in my yard.\\u201d His yard is the base of the Ko\\u2019olaus so it goes up really steeply. I\\u2019m watching from the side of the wall as all these people go and ask their questions of him. My parents turn. I have an old point and shoot camera, and this other woman grabs the camera out of my hand. I\\u2019m trying to take pictures of the green mountains - not of the wizard and my parents. The beauty is so breathtaking that I want to take a picture of it. But this woman comes up. She is a tourist with an accent, not from the US. She grabs my little grey camera and she goes to advance the film - the way you do by pulling back on the lever. But instead of doing that, she starts winding the film up, the way you do when you finish a roll. I can hear her breaking the camera as she does that. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not how you do it. You\\u2019re not actually being helpful.\\u201d But she thinks she\\u2019s being so helpful. I\\u2019m looking at the camera and thinking if I try to advance it just once it will be okay. I try and it doesn\\u2019t work. I can see where it is and open it up, but I know if I do, I will ruin the film. I do open it up and see that sure enough the film on the inside is broken. So there\\u2019s no camera, no pictures. This woman was in line behind my parents who had been talking with the wizard this whole time. I go around the wall and sneak up and sit down to hear what he has to say. There is a sense that he will teach me and share with me what he knows. My parents didn\\u2019t think it was time for me to learn from him because I\\u2019m a kid to them, but I know I\\u2019m me and I can definitely learn all the things that need to be learned about magic from a wizard. He agrees to start teaching me. I sit down with him in his yard at the base of these mountains. There\\u2019s one other piece of the dream where I\\u2019m the observer. It\\u2019s a young couple - teenage kids. They\\u2019ve run off together. They\\u2019ve run away from their families so they can be together even if it\\u2019s just at the beach, which is where I\\u2019m seeing them. She\\u2019s definitely the one who is more riled up and instigating and pushing it. He has fear of his parents and retaliation, but he really loves her and wants to be with her. So the two of them are just hanging out for now. I see him sitting at a dock and she says, \\u201cHey, we\\u2019ve gotta go do these things. We have to get away from our family, society and culture that say we can't be together.\\u201d The boy is a Latino boy. The girl is white. At one point she drops herself into the ocean off the edge of this dock. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh gross, the water is not clean. There is too much pollution. This sandy beach you were sitting on is covered in micro-litter. It\\u2019s just not clean.\\u201d The boy is saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not clean. Don\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we only live once. We have to do these things. Come into the water. Play with me.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my son and we are going to an event - it\\u2019s a game you play and you can win money if you get the answers right, kind of like Jeopardy or something. We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it. My son is about 10 or 11 in the dream. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go do this! It will be fun.\\u201d He\\u2019s kind of dubious. I\\u2019m also a little dubious. I\\u2019m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we\\u2019re going to do this trivia type thing and it\\u2019s all shit I don\\u2019t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We\\u2019ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I\\u2019ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven\\u2019t answered them at all because I didn\\u2019t know the answer. I\\u2019m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can\\u2019t believe I don\\u2019t know the answers to any of these things. I\\u2019m going like, \\u201cWell, this is shit I don\\u2019t care about, so of course I don\\u2019t know the answers.\\u201d All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I\\u2019m completely clueless. Their judgement and my judgement are super real. My son is looking at me like, \\u201cMom, this is not fun.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, this is not fun at all.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting to leave because I honestly don\\u2019t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.\"],[\"I was with my dad in a restaurant. The restaurant is gloomy looking. There are plush booth-like seats. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m just in that space with him. Then he gets up and leaves. I have his briefcase. I don\\u2019t want to be here. I carry his briefcase and go outside. It is bright daylight. It reminds me of being in a casino where they keep the lights dark so you don\\u2019t know what time it is, so the contrast is weird when I walk outside. I walk down this dirt road. There are fields on either side and barbed wire fences. I think I\\u2019m barefoot and I still have his briefcase. I keep walking. I am going past these houses and notice that some of them are old and falling apart - they are the original houses of the neighborhood. And then there are some new gigantic behemoth houses. The new houses are just huge - all I can see is rooftop after rooftop and I can\\u2019t even see the backend of these houses. Then I get past these houses and there are two separate little farms. The houses are older. It\\u2019s clearly a one-person show. Fruits and vegetables are planted and there are flowers. There\\u2019s also hay for mulching. I\\u2019m walking down the lane, then actually walk through the garden because it\\u2019s so inviting. Then I cross over this boundary - a space of land in between these two farms or houses with gardens - to go to the other little farm. Then I realize the ground underneath me is all hot coals, but my feet are not burning. I\\u2019m wanting to cross and get around, but suddenly I\\u2019m in a labyrinth and I can\\u2019t get out of it. The two owners of the house come out - two older white women. They are trying to help me get out of this little inbetween land that is basically all hot coals. It\\u2019s burning their feet, but not mine. They say, \\u201cWell, you can go that way, but you\\u2019re going to burn yourself.\\u201d But I\\u2019m not getting burned. I don\\u2019t go the way I think I\\u2019m going to go because they say I\\u2019m going to burn myself, but it\\u2019s not hot. At one point I do get out and wave goodbye to these women. As I\\u2019m walking down the lane, these dark hedges appear on either side, maybe to my shoulder height. I still have my dad\\u2019s black briefcase in my hand. Now I think I\\u2019m lost. So I pull an old-fashioned walkie-talkie out of the briefcase and press the button and am like, \\u201cHey dad, can you come pick me up?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cHow are you even contacting me?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI have your briefcase and it has this little walkie-talkie in it. Do you remember? It\\u2019s one of the original cell phones we used to have.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI thought I got rid of that a long time ago. How do you have it? How does it even work?\\u201d I keep saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, but can you come get me?\\u201d He\\u2019s fixating on this thing. He doesn\\u2019t ever come get me. I end up in this house with a friend of mine. I don\\u2019t know her in real life. In the dream, she\\u2019s a kind, effervescent, bubbly, very innocent woman with dark hair. She\\u2019s very round with pale skin. Round cheeks, ample breasts, round butt. She and I are walking together. We\\u2019ve walked across a yard into a house. The guy who is there asks, \\u201cCan I help you?\\u201d because we just show up. She starts to make herself super comfy - gets water and starts to cook. The mother and father who own this house show up and they\\u2019re watching her move around. We\\u2019re all having small talk. It\\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that this woman is the perfect partner for the man in this house - the son of the couple that\\u2019s there. Everything she does, you see his eyes getting bigger and bigger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, she does it like how I do it!\\u201d and \\u201cOh my gosh, I never could figure out how to make bread rise and now she can make the bread rise!\\u201d She\\u2019s not showing off, and she\\u2019s very silly about it. He\\u2019s just suddenly smitten. The parents have this grin on their faces and are laughing and like, \\u201cOh yes! Our son\\u2019s finally going to be married off!\\u201d They come together and you can see this is a little match made in heaven. We go back outside. Then the dream skips a bit and I don\\u2019t have the briefcase or walkie-talkie anymore. We are walking down a lane, but now all the houses are on my left, whereas before they were all on my right. There\\u2019s a big rolling hill - like the hills in Hawaii, covered in green grass. I can see up a ways that there is an outdoor patio with an outdoor fire pit like you\\u2019d see at a ski lodge. It\\u2019s the wedding because a bunch of people have gathered. I don\\u2019t recognize anyone except this couple who used to be my old neighbors in the condo I live in now, Rebecca and Oliver. Rebecca was pregnant while they lived here and now she\\u2019s pregnant again. I see them walking up the hill, but they have 7 or maybe 8 children. She\\u2019s carrying an infant and she\\u2019s very far along with another one. Maybe 9 kids all together. I\\u2019m gobsmacked because that\\u2019s so many kids and they\\u2019re all young - all under 5. Part of me doesn\\u2019t know how that\\u2019s possible. I just look at them and are like, \\u201cAre you guys done having kids?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cNo, we love children.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, if you\\u2019ve got the resources!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at Rebecca and she looks a little haggard, but Oliver is right there with her helping with all the young kids. The dream ends with me wondering why they have so many kids.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I\\u2019m in the back - the receiving room. There\\u2019s tons of product to put out, but it\\u2019s time to close and go home. So we\\u2019re all working as quick as we can. My coworkers along with the manager I usually close with at night are there. My manager is saying, \\u201cOkay, finish this cart, but leave the rest. It\\u2019s time to get out. We need to be done.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what she says, so I gather up my stuff and go out. But then she's like, \\u201cOh no, we\\u2019re not leaving out. We have to put all this away.\\u201d There are a bunch of brand new carts out in this open space in the store. They have orange handles and our carts have green handles, so I\\u2019m looking at these orange handles and one of my other coworkers who is also a manager says, \\u201cHey, can you clean that one cart right there?\\u201d It has all this sticky stuff on it - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s honey or maple syrup or what. I\\u2019m looking at it and am like, \\u201cOh my god, this is going to take forever to clean. I just want to go home.\\u201d But they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t go home until this stuff is put away or cleaned up.\\u201d So, I\\u2019m scrubbing this and I\\u2019m pretty cranky about it. I get it clean. Then I realize later that if I had just stuck the cart in the freezer, that stuff would have frozen and I could have just flaked it off. But I get it cleaned and I roll it to the back. Now everybody is ready to go, but they\\u2019re waiting on me because it took me forever to clean that cart. I sit down because I need to change my shoes and take off my apron. They\\u2019re all in the room where we clock out. I\\u2019m still in the break room, trying to hurry. Suddenly, this pole appears in the receiving room in the back. The coworker who told me to clean all the sticky stuff off the cart is like, \\u201cOh, can you show me some pole stuff? I want to see what it looks like.\\u201d So, I get on there and I do some moves. I\\u2019m totally impressed with myself because I didn\\u2019t know I could do all these moves and they look good. She\\u2019s totally impressed. But I still have this in the back of my mind that I need to hurry up and get my stuff and go. But she\\u2019s like, \\u201cShow me another one.\\u201d So I go to do the same moves but on the other side - my drunk side. I\\u2019m not as good on the drunk side. I don\\u2019t hang onto the pole and I\\u2019m falling off. I feel rushed anyway. So I mess it up. I don't fall off the pole, but I get off real quick. She leaves. I go to gather my stuff again because I still don\\u2019t have everything because I was on the pole. I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes. I get my shoes on. In my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you putting these heels on? You\\u2019re going to have to get in the car and drive. It\\u2019s hard to drive in heels. You should just leave your flats on.\\u201d I get my bag. It\\u2019s one of those sports bags that have shoes and my lunch and my earrings - I haven\\u2019t put my earrings back on. I go to leave and I\\u2019m rushed because everybody is waiting on me. We walk out the back door. I\\u2019m no longer in town. As soon as I go out the back door, I\\u2019m somewhere else. I\\u2019m not entirely sure where I am. There\\u2019s a train like the sugarcane train that\\u2019s in Maui that is open on all sides. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I gotta catch this train.\\u201d I get on the train. I am still messing with my shoes and I don\\u2019t get off at my stop. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, well it\\u2019s okay, I\\u2019ll keep riding the train.\\u201d I think maybe I\\u2019ll walk home. I don\\u2019t know why I decide to stay on the train instead of getting off at my stop. Now the train goes and it\\u2019s long past any of my stops. We\\u2019re passing a ton of ocean - there\\u2019s this large expanse of ocean on my right side. The train is on land still, but all of this ocean passes and suddenly I\\u2019m in Lahaina, on Maui. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m really screwed now. There\\u2019s no way for me to get home.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left my phone at work - at the grocery store. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well maybe i can just get off at this stop and I\\u2019ll walk home.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019m going to walk home. It\\u2019s so far for me to get home. So I go to get off the train at this one stop as I hear the conductor say, \\u201cAnybody for this street?\\u201d The street names are all in Hawaiian. It looks like we\\u2019re on Front Street in Lahaina, at least parts of it look like what I remember Front STreet looking like. So I go to get off and then I realize, \\u201cNope, I can\\u2019t.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left that sports travel duffel bag on the train, too. So, the train goes into town and then it starts to reverse a little bit and backs up for a couple of stops. I get off at the stop closest to home, except it\\u2019s still miles and miles away. I get off and then I realize I can\\u2019t get off and this is silly of me. There\\u2019s no way I can get anywhere and I left my bag on the train. So I get back on and go to get my bag. But now I don\\u2019t know what to do because the train is going to go forward again. I\\u2019m just going to be further away from home than I want to be. But if I get off here, there\\u2019s no one for me to call to get me home and I don\\u2019t have my phone with me. I think, \\u201cWell, my dad lives in Lahaina.\\u201d But even then, I can\\u2019t call him and I don\\u2019t want to be with or near him anyway.\"],[\"This dream starts with Dana and I. We\\u2019re together and learning about anti-racism. We\\u2019re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We\\u2019re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He\\u2019s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we\\u2019re all watching. I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I\\u2019m feeling unsure and I don't know what we\\u2019re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don\\u2019t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I\\u2019m white. So I\\u2019m nervous. We\\u2019re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, \\u201cWhat do I do with Majesty?! I\\u2019m not nursing and I can\\u2019t feed him!\\u201d I have this feeling that I can\\u2019t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I\\u2019m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We\\u2019re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, you just dropped the baby!\\u201d I go to pick up the baby and Majesty\\u2019s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no!\\u201d I\\u2019m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?\\u201d Then I realize Majesty\\u2019s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he\\u2019s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he\\u2019s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphitheatre. I\\u2019m going to watch a performance. Everybody in the crowd is dressed to the nines like they\\u2019re going to see an opera. In the front row I see Nani, Janet and Shawna who are my three friends from high school that I used to hang out with. I see them and am pretending not to see them because I don't want to talk to them. But they see me and I see them track me. I walk past them and sit. I watch the performance (I don\\u2019t remember what it was). The performance ends and I walk out of the theatre. I\\u2019m in the lobby now and the lobby looks an awful lot like the lobby of the theatre at the high school I went to. It was called Gates Theatre because that was the last name of the people who donated enough money to build it. The three of them call my name and are like, \\u201cRose! Hi! We see you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, hi!\\u201d But I don\\u2019t want to talk. In Junior year of high school, Nani and Janet dropped me from the friend group and Shawna went with another friend group so I was left with no friends in my junior year. In my senior year, Nani moved away, but she sent me a letter apologizing for ostracizing me and leaving me out. I realize this is my hesitation. They always show up in my dreams and I'm like, Eh. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou know what, I\\u2019m great, I\\u2019m fine.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do small talk. But Nani wants a hug, so I guess I\\u2019ll hug her. Then I get away as quickly as I can. I go sit on a barstool at a tall table. My classmate Ikaika who I've known since second grade cruises by. He does this double take because I don\\u2019t look how I used to look and it\\u2019s not just age - I\\u2019ve had a nose job since my brother broke my nose and I just look different than I did in high school. He\\u2019s trying to figure out who it is. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey Ikaika, it\\u2019s Rose.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d He\\u2019s doing the double take thing and side eye thing that men do when they see an attractive woman. He's like, \\u201cYou are so beautiful. You are gorgeous.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup!\\u201d I hug him hello and we do some small talk and then he goes on his way. Then the dream comes back around to King Noire and anti-racism and sex work. Now I\\u2019m in a car with King. It\\u2019s a Cadillac and the top is down. We\\u2019re driving through a city and through some shady neighborhoods. I\\u2019m taking everything in. My jaw is dropped. He\\u2019s talking to me about sex, anti-racism and social justice. I can\\u2019t recall his exact words. He\\u2019s teaching and I\\u2019m listening. We end up near a river. There\\u2019s a shell floaty - like Aphrodite. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, now here\\u2019s the part of your education aroudn sex.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d Oh, I\\u2019ve been eating blueberries and they\\u2019re so sweet - they\\u2019re the most magical delicious blueberries that have ever existed. I climb on the shell and I have the blueberries. I\\u2019m wearing a skirt. King offers me the rest of the blueberries: \\u201cTake as many as you want because these are the last of them. So I put the blueberries in my lap right over my pussy. I\\u2019m eating them and am reclined back in this shell that is now floating down the river. King is like, \\u201cNow it\\u2019s time for your sex education.\\u201d There are so many feelings and thoughts and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what to do!\\u201d He leans over me and starts to eat the blueberries out of my lap where I have them nestled in my skirt. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh hell yes!\\u201d When I look up, I realize he\\u2019s completely naked and he\\u2019s leaning over me from the top. So it\\u2019s like yes, his penis is right in my face. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! I know what to do with this!\\u201d From that point forward, all of my \\u201coh my god I don't know what\\u2019s happening\\u201d thoughts change to \\u201coh I don\\u2019t need to be an expert, I know what to do with what's in front of me.\\u201d There\\u2019s this beautiful dick hanging in front of my mouth and I am definitely going to suck on that. It\\u2019s a knowing. This part ends with us 69\\u2019ing in a shell floating down a river in a city by some shady neighborhoods. It\\u2019s not a problem! I realize I was just getting in my own way of things I was trying to learn. The whole time King was being very stern and very king-like. There\\u2019s a recognition of King and his wife - they are so centered, they know who they are, they know what they\\u2019re doing here, they know their worth, they don't fucking question it, they just are king and queen. The whole time I didn\\u2019t know if I was worthy. But by the end of the dream, I knew what to do and realized this is very human. What else would you do if I had a lapful of blueberries?!\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to see my lover. He\\u2019s working out in the forest. There\\u2019s a complex of a bunch of buildings where he\\u2019s working with a bunch of his buddies. One building is a dorm. There\\u2019s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I\\u2019m out there and thinking I\\u2019ll do this work with him. He\\u2019s really not happy to see me. He\\u2019s really pissed off that I\\u2019m in his space. I\\u2019m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there\\u2019s a whole sheet of them, so there\\u2019s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I\\u2019ve collected it and I\\u2019m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There\\u2019s a presence of my son, but he\\u2019s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don\\u2019t come out here.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019m actually here to do work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t lie to me. I know you\\u2019re here to see me.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling hurt and confused. I\\u2019m not really sure why I\\u2019m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he\\u2019s not happy about it. I\\u2019m not happy about it now either, because he\\u2019s being a bit of a dick. He\\u2019s asking me all kinds of questions like, \\u201cWhat are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?\\u201d He\\u2019s asking all these questions that I don\\u2019t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn\\u2019t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can\\u2019t remember. In the last scene, I\\u2019m with a client of mine who is getting married. It\\u2019s the day of the wedding and I\\u2019m there as an officiant. I\\u2019m also there to set up the wedding. It\\u2019s the second time she\\u2019s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting read are not there. I\\u2019m trying to make these burlap pumpkins as part of the decor. I\\u2019m just making do with what I\\u2019ve got because I can\\u2019t find some of the supplies I used last time when I was getting everything ready for the wedding, but it didn\\u2019t happen. This time I\\u2019m trying to do my best with what I\\u2019ve got. My client is really excited. She\\u2019s trying on her wedding dress. She\\u2019s showing it to me. We\\u2019re in this room that\\u2019s part of a bigger hall where she\\u2019s getting married. Her bridesmaids are there and there are other people. It\\u2019s going to work even though it got canceled once and we don\\u2019t have all the supplies we had last night. We\\u2019re still making the wedding work and she still looks beautiful. There\\u2019s joy in this part of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with this older man in his 50s or so - he\\u2019s white with blonde curly hair like a surfer dude. His body is in shape, but since he\\u2019s 50 everything is not as firm. He has a wife, but we\\u2019re hanging out together. I don\\u2019t know what exactly we\\u2019re doing. We\\u2019re exploring some kind of weird relationship. The scene stays in mind of us in bed together. I\\u2019ve thrown the covers back to get out of bed and I\\u2019ve started my period. There\\u2019s a little bit of blood on the sheets. I\\u2019m wearing underwear, which is crazy because I don\\u2019t. There\\u2019s blood on the inside of the underwear and it has seeped through. I take the underwear off and go to take a shower. I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and am rinsing the underwear in cold water. I see the words \\u201cBlockbuster\\u201d stamped on the inside of the underwear. I\\u2019m watching the blood disappear. I get up and come back to the bedroom and the man\\u2019s wife is there. We\\u2019ve both known he\\u2019s married and she\\u2019s fine with me being around. She\\u2019s older - their age is matched. I come back and she\\u2019s there. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re caretaking me in a way. It feels strange. In another scene, my daughter is a toddler, 2 or 3 years old. She\\u2019s how she was as a baby - on me all the time. I feel like one part of me knows I need to let her be on me for attachment and all that, but another part of me is like, \\u201coh my gosh child, get off, I need to breathe.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much more to this dream, but it\\u2019s gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my brother, sister and son whois 4 or 5 in this dream. We\\u2019re on a rooftop of a building. The building is a college. I have my son in multiple pairs of pants. He\\u2019s old enough to get dressed himself and he comes out wearing this. Even though he seems to be younger, he\\u2019s also 9 - his age is ambiguous. My brother is young and looks as though he did in high school. My sister also looks younger, like how she did in high school. There\\u2019s a break in college and we\\u2019ve all met up between classes and have gone out onto this rooftop. You can see this black wall of clouds off in the distance. They are turning greenish and as I\\u2019m watching, they form a funnel and there\\u2019s a tornado heading our direction. I\\u2019m yelling at my son to go in the door we came out of onto this rooftop. There\\u2019s also a set of fire escape stairs. My brother is over there. My brother and sister were excited about the parties they were going to go to. They are totally doing the college thing. But I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019m too old for this shit and I don\\u2019t drink - it\\u2019s not my thing - plus I have this little one to take care of. So I see this funnel and am yelling at my brother and sister to look and be careful. I\\u2019m also yelling at my son to run back in the door inside where he\\u2019ll be safe. My son goes inside and is panicked. My brother and sister do not believe me and just stay out there. I watch through this thick glass window. As the storm tornado goes by, this woman appears and she\\u2019s sitting in a chair. The chair is small and wooden with two slots across the back. It\\u2019s like she was the tornado or was in the tornado. She\\u2019s telling my siblings what to do. So instead of the tornado sucking them up and carrying them off, she\\u2019s telling them to go jump off the edge of the roof. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to die either way, but I\\u2019m telling you that instead of sucking you up, you\\u2019re just going to jump off.\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified. I want my siblings! But I also want to protect my son. I know at any point, if she turns around and sees us or especially sees my son, she\\u2019ll kill us, too. So I\\u2019m not being gentle with my son at all. I\\u2019m being really rough and have grabbed him by his shirt. I\\u2019m shoving him down because there\\u2019s a dresser between us and the window. The woman is on the other side. All I can see is the back of her and she\\u2019s sitting in the chair. Her hair is dark and is up in a bun. I can\\u2019t see much else. So I\\u2019m shoving my son down so she can\\u2019t see him. The dresser is between them. He keeps trying to pop up to see her, and I very roughly shove his body back down. I\\u2019m yelling at him to stay down so she can\\u2019t see him. I see my brother and sister disappear. She disappears and the funnel dissipates even though the clouds dissipate. I tell my son to stay and I go out the door to look. Of course there is no sign of my brother and sister anywhere. My son is distraught. He\\u2019s screaming and crying and so mad at me for being rough at him and so upset about his aunt and uncle leaving. He regresses into a younger child, from 9 to 3. I feel horrible because I was so physically rough with him and verbally unkind in trying to keep him hidden. I think I just traumatized him in so many ways.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been in school learning. I just have a vague impression of being in school. Right now I\\u2019m out. I\\u2019m either looking for food and have bought food from what used to be a McDonald\\u2019s, but things still look weird post-quarantine and there\\u2019s only limited availability. The golden arches sign is no longer available to be used. I\\u2019ve bought boxed cereal and some other items, but they\\u2019re stale. I\\u2019m going back to return them. I\\u2019ve gone inside the building. I have these two big grocery bags with the cereal and other stuff. I go back to the counter and tell the woman who\\u2019s working behind the counter in her viser and McDonald\\u2019s uniform that I\\u2019m returning these. The whole time I\\u2019m thinking that you can\\u2019t return cereal to McDonald\\u2019s, they don\\u2019t do returns. But she takes the cereal and whatever else I have in the bag. I\\u2019m really relieved. It was a big pain in the ass and burden to have all this cereal and other stuff that was stale and I couldn\\u2019t eat and spent money. I was relieved to get my money back, but also surprised. The scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a gigantic empty warehouse. A wedding or birthday is happening - something is being celebrated. But again, things are kind of strange because the crowd is sparse. There is a pastor or somebody doing the marrying or celebrating...or maybe someone has graduated? My friend from high school, Teresa, is there. She\\u2019s all by herself. I see her but she doesn\\u2019t see me yet. It\\u2019s been years and years since we\\u2019ve seen each other and I\\u2019m really excited. But for the moment our focus is on what\\u2019s happening in this party thing. The ceremony concludes and there\\u2019s a handful of other people - some men - one of which I think is her husband and the husband\\u2019s side of the family. I\\u2019m watching because it seems odd that she\\u2019s not hanging out with or sitting next to him. She\\u2019s off by herself. So I go to talk to her and say hello because I haven\\u2019t seen her in forever. She\\u2019s happy to see me and I'm happy to see her. We talk a little about the ceremony that just happened. There\\u2019s some sort of triage that has to happen. Someone is sick or ill and needs some help. I watch her as she helps this person. We\\u2019re still catching up. Then she finishes what she's doing and I ask her: \\u201cSo how is your husband? How is your married life?\\u201d She gives me this look. I look at her fingers to see if she has a wedding ring on. She has multiple rings on. I think one of them is a wedding ring. But she gives me this look and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been the most painful thing I\\u2019ve ever experienced.\\u201d I'm not sure if she\\u2019s still married or not. She says, \\u201cHe cheated on me.\\u201d I can see on her face that she still has pain around being cheated on. I still cannot tell if they\\u2019re still together or not by the way she\\u2019s talking. She is relaying to me the absolute pain she has experienced in finding out her husband cheated on her. I\\u2019m looking at her and am like, \\u201cWell, my husband didn\\u2019t cheat on me, but I\\u2019m no longer married and I\\u2019m in a situation where things are kind of hairy and frustrating and it doesn\\u2019t feel good.\\u201d We talk about that a little bit. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been so long and we have so much to catch up on.\\u201d As she\\u2019s telling me this, she\\u2019s talking really quickly because she has to catch a plane and leave now that the ceremony is over. Again, I\\u2019ve been looking at her fingers for a wedding ring and I\\u2019m also looking to see if she\\u2019s pregnant. I keep thinking she is pregnant, but I can\\u2019t quite tell. She tells me a little bit of her story. I realize that whatever plane she was supposed to catch, she\\u2019s probably missed it or we\\u2019re bending time because it\\u2019s taking awhile for her to tell this story. There is a sense of urgency that she has to go, though. I am feeling that I really want to hear her and witness for her. It seems important to do that. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a grocery store and it\\u2019s very dark out. It\\u2019s not night, but there are dark clouds. Everything is dark out and even the grocery store is dark and dreary even though there are fluorescent lights. It\\u2019s pretty packed with people. I have a cart and I\\u2019m shopping for the kids. I\\u2019m doing the week\\u2019s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I\\u2019m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me. I\\u2019m walking through the aisles and my kids and are talking about what they want for dinner. Then my ex shows up and he says, \\u201cWell you can\\u2019t actually have the kids. You\\u2019re not going to get to spend a lot of time with them. You\\u2019re just shopping, then I\\u2019m going to take all of this and leave with the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m fucking pissed that he\\u2019s treating me like that and talking me like that and manipulating the kids in front of me. I can see that they\\u2019re torn because they were just having a great time with me, but when he showed up, their allegiance went straight to him. He\\u2019s saying he\\u2019s just going to take the groceries and all this because he\\u2019s paying for them. I\\u2019m so done with him and seeing the kids frustrated that I say, \\u201cNo, you do it. I\\u2019m out of here. I\\u2019m not going to participate in this.\\u201d The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very \\u201cfuck you\\u2019ish\\u201d way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It\\u2019s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I\\u2019m so mad, but I\\u2019m very clear that I\\u2019m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I\\u2019m not playing his game. I\\u2019m not doing it his way.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark again - that\\u2019s been the persistent theme with all these dreams lately - it\\u2019s either twilight, or nighttime, or just dark. This time I\\u2019m in a flat that I rent with a bunch of other people. We\\u2019re in school again. My high school classmate Connie is one of my roommates in this apartment that I\\u2019m in. There are four other roommates and they\\u2019re all men and they\\u2019re really rowdy. It\\u2019s nighttime and also bedtime, so I\\u2019m trying to sleep. All of the beds are in the living room; it\\u2019s not like we have separate bedrooms to go to. The dudes are all wired, they\\u2019re totally super high energy. But I\\u2019m super tired and wanting to go to sleep. Connie is wanting to go to sleep. She\\u2019s kind of fussing over me, trying to make sure I\\u2019m okay. The guys are bouncing around the living room, fighting and wrestling with each other and getting kind of nasty and obnoxious and drinking. I\\u2019m trying to fall asleep on my bed. Even though it\\u2019s my apartment and my place of rest, I feel like a guest, especially with the way Connie is fussing over me and making sure I have all the things I need. She\\u2019s going out of her way to explain the other roommates\\u2019 behavior. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, Rose, we see you, we see you\\u2019re sleeping, but we can\\u2019t help ourselves, so you\\u2019re just going to have to deal with it.\\u201d There\\u2019s an air of \\u201ctough shit.\\u201d I\\u2019m lying down and next to my bed is a screen that separates my bed from all the other beds. It\\u2019s a light colored pine wooden screen with slats. I get a phone call from James, one of my roommates from this dream. In real life James is a friend of a friend who I just went camping with. I like him a lot - he\\u2019s a very soft spoken person and in his day job he works with conflict resolution and has the biggest heart and is so kind. In the dream, he\\u2019s calling me to check up on me and make sure I\\u2019m okay with all the noise and violence. There\\u2019s an undercurrent of violence and threat of sexual harassment. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNot really. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable or safe to sleep, that\\u2019s for sure.\\u201d The dream shifts out of this flat and goes outside. It\\u2019s still dark outside - this eerie green darkness that comes before a thunderstorm or tornado. I can see James in the distance and he\\u2019s with other people. It\\u2019s his wedding - he\\u2019s engaged in real life and they were supposed to be married this year, but they\\u2019re pushing the wedding off to next year because of coronavirus. It\\u2019s not a bright sunny wedding. I can't hear what\\u2019s going on. I can just see James and the people moving in the distance. I\\u2019m watching and I have this feeling of melancholy and curiosity.\"],[\"It\\u2019s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I\\u2019m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It\\u2019s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it\\u2019s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I\\u2019m going in and out of groups and shops. I\\u2019m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it\\u2019s a shop or someone\\u2019s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave and walk out. I\\u2019m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I\\u2019m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I\\u2019m hovering - I\\u2019m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don\\u2019t see me. They\\u2019re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m standing there, but I\\u2019m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they\\u2019re not seeing me. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a lake or the ocean. There\\u2019s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It\\u2019s all outdoors. As I\\u2019m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I\\u2019m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I\\u2019m telling them, \\u201cYes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great\\u201d because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I\\u2019m not going to get any of them because I\\u2019m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They\\u2019ve gotten their cheese and now they\\u2019re at the wine bar ordering wine. I\\u2019m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, \\u201cWe actually have work to do.\\u201d There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There\\u2019s a hose right there. She says, \\u201cI have all these things I have to clean.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I\\u2019ll help you clean these things.\\u201d So we\\u2019re scrubbing containers and tubs. I\\u2019m doing all the scrubbing and she\\u2019s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She\\u2019s really sad. I\\u2019m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn\\u2019t doing a whole lot. She\\u2019s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I\\u2019m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I\\u2019m just doing the motions. There\\u2019s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a shower stall with Ana. I can\\u2019t remember if our clothes are on or off. We\\u2019re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I\\u2019m looking at her like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re just kind of winging it.\\u201d I wish I could remember more, but there\\u2019s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with my siblings. We\\u2019re all in a big house together and it\\u2019s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We\\u2019re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it\\u2019s just covered in blueberries. We\\u2019re munching on them. We\\u2019re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he\\u2019s not a very smooth driver. So I\\u2019m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he\\u2019s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it\\u2019s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We\\u2019re in a house of some sort but I don\\u2019t recognize it and I don\\u2019t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we\\u2019re all gathered for a wedding. I\\u2019m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he\\u2019s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there\\u2019s no bowl and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cHey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.\\u201d The popcorn starts popping and it\\u2019s endless. I\\u2019m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it\\u2019s going everywhere. It wouldn\\u2019t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I\\u2019m looking down and thinking you can\\u2019t even save this. He\\u2019s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, \\u201cnice way to go, dad,\\u201d and I think my dad is standing there like, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s not a good way to pop popcorn.\\u201d As he\\u2019s sweeping up the popcorn, there\\u2019s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There\\u2019s tons of it and it\\u2019s all over the floor. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what you\\u2019re going to do with all of this. You\\u2019re going to have to throw it away.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make more.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.\\u201d It feels like a waste. There was more to this dream, but I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and my siblings are there as well as my mom and dad. My youngest brother is the one I\\u2019m interacting with. They\\u2019re young, it\\u2019s when they were babies. My ex is there, he\\u2019s somewhere in the mix. My current lover is with me, as well. We\\u2019re trying to clean the bedroom and get my younger brothers ready for school. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I\\u2019m getting frustrated trying to get them ready. My lover and I want to take a shower. We walk into the bathroom and the entire bathroom is covered in shit and grey water and toilet paper. It\\u2019s like a toilet backed up all the way to the ceiling. There are white tiles on the shower wall and the whole bathroom is white, but it\\u2019s covered in this grey old toilet paper and poop. We\\u2019re both standing there barefoot, having walked in and are like, \\u201coh my god, this is so gross,\\u201d but not having another option. We just had to clean it. We\\u2019re both naked and trying to clean it. It\\u2019s just so gross. At one point we fill the whole bathroom with water to wash it all away. Neither of us are happy about it. I have some feelings of embarrassment and I can tell my lover is annoyed, but it\\u2019s just something we have to do. So we clean it. Then we get my little brother off to a race - it\\u2019s like a go-cart race. We get him to the race in time after cleaning the disgusting bathroom. So gross.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on the campus of the school I went to for middle school, which was an old inn that was converted into a school. The buildings are all layered shingles and it was really a beautiful campus. I have in the back of my head a nagging, \\u201cHey, you have a car that you have to pick up. You have an appointment with your car.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t put it in my phone calendar for whatever reason. I\\u2019m there on the campus and taking classes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine, I\\u2019ll just remember or I\\u2019ll just know when it\\u2019s time to go.\\u201d So I\\u2019m in classes and car alarms are going off and they\\u2019re kind of irritating. One of my friends from high school is there. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cGod, can you hear those car alarms? They\\u2019re so annoying.\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering if one of the car alarms is my car that I need to go take in and I just haven\\u2019t. Then, she says, \\u201cI also need to go. Can you drive me?\\u201d I grab my keys. The campus has completely shifted. Now everything is concrete - the walls, the stairs, the floor, everything. We\\u2019re walking out of the classroom and down some stairs and into the parking lot. I can\\u2019t find my car anywhere. So we just get into a car. I think someone else is driving and they start driving us around. This part is blurry; all I can remember is the impression of being driven around in a car. At one point I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI need to get out because I need to get my car.\\u201d I leave my friend and whoever is driving us. My hands are full of things. One of the things I have is a parachute-type thing and it\\u2019s small enough to fit in my hand. It\\u2019s really, really windy out. I\\u2019m still on this mission to go find my car. Now I\\u2019m walking down the side of the road - it\\u2019s the piece of the road that was right before the turn to my neighborhood when I was growing up. So this is all happening in Hawaii. I\\u2019m talking to my dad. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s on the phone or in person. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey dad, I\\u2019m trying to find the car. It needs to be fixed. But watch this. I\\u2019m going to be able to get to it real quick.\\u201d I start running in the direction of the wind and the wind grabs that parachute thing in my hand and I start flying. I am flying down the road with it and he\\u2019s totally impressed that I\\u2019m doing it. The cars that are driving by me are impressed and they\\u2019re totally honking. I\\u2019m flying down the road. I fly way further than I could have walked. I get halfway down the road that takes us from our house down to the beaches. There\\u2019s a pullout on one side of the road. On the other side of the road is a pullout but also a cave. So I cross the road and go into this cave because I\\u2019m thinking my car will be there. There\\u2019s all this half-done prep for a meal and it\\u2019s been left. So I go into this cave and see all these countertops with everything you would need in a kitchen - utensils, a stove, a vitamix, a mixer, all kinds of kitchen tools I don\\u2019t even recognize, a sink full of dishes. It looks like it has been left for weeks and weeks and weeks. No one has cleaned it. They were in the middle of a meal when they left, so there are things rotting and it\\u2019s gross. This whole time I have this feeling that I\\u2019ve gotta find the car and I need to get it fixed. But then when I walk into this kitchen, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh shit, I gotta clean all this up, too. I gotta take all this stuff out to the compost.\\u201d I have this nagging feeling the whole time. Somebody joins me, a younger man. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, I gotta work on all this, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, do you want to help me clean this up?\\u201d He starts cleaning up. Then my dad shows up at this cave. He says, \\u201cWell, if you want to get in my car, I\\u2019ll help you find your car.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, what about cleaning up this cave?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, you can do that later or whatever.\\u201d The dream ends here and I don\\u2019t know if I get in my dad\\u2019s car or what.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger\\u2019s seat. We\\u2019re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I\\u2019m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex\\u2019s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It\\u2019s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she\\u2019s there, but I\\u2019m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There\\u2019s only one white man in the entire house. It\\u2019s so interesting. I\\u2019m noticing all of this. They\\u2019re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There\\u2019s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the \\u201cI feel\\u201d and \\u201cI experience\\u201d and \\u201cWhen this happened, it made me feel like this\\u201d language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It\\u2019s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, \\u201cOh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.\\u201d I start to get this nagging feeling that it\\u2019s time for us to continue on our road trip. I\\u2019ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it\\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. I\\u2019m cleaning up my space. It\\u2019s like an Airbnb, so I\\u2019m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she\\u2019s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I\\u2019m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I\\u2019m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I\\u2019m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it\\u2019s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don\\u2019t, and I change my clothes. I\\u2019m kind of damp. I don\\u2019t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren\\u2019t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.\"],[\"There are a bunch of kids that I\\u2019m in charge of somehow. I\\u2019m a caretaker, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure how - I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m their mother or not. I\\u2019m needing to get them to a safer place. I have a little bit of help. There are hallways where I\\u2019m trying to gather them up from and get them on a bus so they can be in a safer spot. I\\u2019m really clear that I don\\u2019t want that responsibility. I\\u2019m going to make sure they get where they need to go, but after that the choices I make are going to have a lot less to do with being their caretaker 24/7. These are not my kids. These are just random children. I can't tell if it\\u2019s a school or daycare or something. It\\u2019s everybody\\u2019s children, but they are not of my body. So, there are other people around who are also caretaking them and trying to get them to wherever they need to go. There\\u2019s just this feeling of needing to get them to a safe place. We get them somewhere, but I drift out of the scene somehow. I end up trying to find a home for myself. My beloved is with me now. We\\u2019re looking at houses - they are the same houses we were looking for for the kids. We were looking at a dormitory or something for them to live in. i\\u2019m looking for a house for myself. I\\u2019m clear that I only want enough house for me and one other person to come stay with me whenever they want. They find a cute house. I can only see the inside of it. It\\u2019s in a neighborhood kind of like the one I grew up in, but I can't really see the outside of it. There are cute cupboards. There isn\\u2019t a lot of space because it\\u2019s just me. There is a lot of wood paneling on the inside. I\\u2019m trying to decide if I\\u2019m going to be there. Then we go out of the house and all of a sudden there\\u2019s water everywhere - ocean. I\\u2019m collecting shells and I can see down to the bottom of the ocean. It\\u2019s really clear. I\\u2019m trying to collect the shells and I drop one and watch it sink down to the bottom. I\\u2019m trying to gauge the depth of the water based on how small the item looks, but water magnifies it so i can\\u2019t tell the true depth of the water. So I\\u2019m looking at this one shell that I dropped which then turns into a shoe. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not my shoe. I don\\u2019t want the shoe, I want my shell. The shells are prettier.\\u201d My beloved is there and he\\u2019s helping me collect these shells and I have a few. Then the scene morphs. That one shoe takes me to another scene. I\\u2019m carrying bags of trash. It\\u2019s actually not trash - it\\u2019s stuff I\\u2019m getting rid of, all these clothes and things I used to have or need but now I don\\u2019t. It includes pairs of shoes. The trash bags go in the trashcan and the pairs of shoes go on top of the trashcan. I\\u2019m back in a neighborhood again and I\\u2019m taking the trash over to my neighbor\\u2019s house so she can look at it. I take out one bag of trash and only one shoe, one of my snow boots. I go get another bag of stuff and the other boot goes on top of the can. Then I get a third bag and there\\u2019s one more shoe - I don\\u2019t remember what kind of shoe. I see these three shoes and then all of a sudden I\\u2019m done with this and want to dance. I want to dance like the way break dancers dance with all body weight and where you go upside down a lot. But I\\u2019m not very good at it. This area where I was taking the trash bags to changes into an amphitheatre with no walls. There are lights being projected. I\\u2019m moving my body and it\\u2019s really awkward in the beginning. My body hurts, I don\\u2019t have the strength for some of the moves, I can\\u2019t think of some of the moves I want to do, I don\\u2019t have much flow and my body is really jerky. At some point I see myself in a mirror - these mirrors have shown up as part of the walls even though it\\u2019s a completely outdoor space. I have short deep auburn red hair. At one point, scratches appear on my back. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no no, we\\u2019re not going that direction!\\u201d I somehow wipe the scratches off my back as an observer, then I go back into my body and try to dance. I think there\\u2019s part of me that is still in the observer role because I\\u2019m watching myself dance in the mirror. Suddenly the mirrors turn a brilliant turquoise blue. They become the background. There\\u2019s also granite rock mountains in the back. I feel something click in my body and brain and I let go. I\\u2019m suddenly dancing fluidly and my body becomes a lot more muscular. I suddenly have the musculature to be upside down and doing handstands with splits and backflips and a lot of break dance moves where you spin on your shoulders and flip in the air. My legs are really strong. Everything is really really strong. This background of turquoise teal blue is bright like an electric vibrant brightness and the granite rock is reflected in the mirror somehow with me also reflected in the mirror doing dances to some music I can hear.\"],[\"An Asian woman who is shorter than me and is beautiful with long hair down to her waist and a beautiful body and face doesn\\u2019t believe she is beautiful. She keeps saying she\\u2019s not beautiful. I\\u2019m watching her take off her clothes and look at herself in the mirror. As she looks at herself, her legs and hips start to get really big and swollen with fluids like elephantiasis. It\\u2019s just from the waist down. She\\u2019s just telling herself that she looks ugly. There\\u2019s a man in the room with her who keeps telling her, \\u201cNo, no, you look beautiful.\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t believe him. She can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and she can\\u2019t understand him. I\\u2019m watching this interaction and thinking in my head, \\u201cYes, he\\u2019s right. Listen to him!\\u201d But she can\\u2019t hear it.\"],[\"Wild dreams! I\\u2019m hanging with my brother, the one born right after me. We go into a bar because he wants a drink, but I\\u2019m not drinking. We walk into this bar and it\\u2019s a two-story high bar and I can see a balcony where I can see the second story. It\\u2019s wood paneling, so the bar is dark and very masculine. There are deer heads on the wall and the tables are round and wooden. It kind of reminds me of a saloon, like a cliche Western. We walk up to the corner of the bar so my brother can order his drink. I turn around and see three guys who I haven't seen in a long time. One of the guys is a classmate of mine and also grew up on the same street as me. I haven\\u2019t seen him since we graduated. I'm like, \\u201cOh my god! Hi! How are you?!\\u201d He\\u2019s really tall, taller than me and I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d so he\\u2019s 6\\u20194\\u201d or 6\\u20195\\u201d so I\\u2019m definitely looking up at him. There\\u2019s also my friend Johnny who I grew up with in the same neighborhood, though we didn\\u2019t go to school together. I knew him the whole time growing up. There\\u2019s one other person, maybe Ikaika, another classmate who I\\u2019ve known since second grade. They come and stand behind me. They\\u2019re ordering drinks over my shoulder to the bartender. Initially I'm like, \\u201cOh my gosh, hi, it\\u2019s so good to see you all!\\u201d Then they\\u2019re like, \\u201cHey!\\u201d My former high school classmate starts asking me these condescending questions like: \\u201cHow are you and what are you doing in your life? What have you accomplished?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, Whoa! This took a turn that I wasn\\u2019t expecting. They\\u2019re standing over me so I\\u2019m definitely feeling attacked and defensive. I don\\u2019t know if I get up on a chair or suddenly have super powers, so I can hover above them. But I get above them, the bartender and my brother and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAnd what are you all doing with your life? Are you guys looking at your misogynistic beliefs and your sexist behaviors? What are you doing to undo the patriarchy and fight for social justice? How are you looking at your biases and your beliefs?\\u201d I\\u2019m asking specifically about their racial and gender biases and beliefs. I\\u2019m hovering over them as I say that. Then I just leave the bar because I\\u2019m disgusted with how they initially talked to me. I just didn\\u2019t want anything to do with them afterwards. As I was talking to them I could see they didn\\u2019t understand what I was talking about at all. They did not get the concept of biases or patriarchy or any of that. Complete scene change. Now I\\u2019m observing. There are a bunch of people who have been in a white van that you always see in the news. It\\u2019s like these forces are coming after the people in the van. The only three people I know for sure are the driver, Donny who does my taxes, Johnny with his wife Amanda who I've known since second grade and their kids. I\\u2019m also in the van, participating and observing. I have a sense of other people in the van. We\\u2019re trying to get somewhere and Donny is driving super crazy over snow, through woods, across rivers. There\\u2019s very little road driving happening in this first part. We are totally besieged. There are people or things not of this world that are coming after us and trying to kill us, literally trying to wipe us out. So we get to Johnny\\u2019s mansion. We are beat up. Some of us are dead. Not everyone in the van made it. The creatures that were going after us are still going after us. They gave us just long enough of a break to go inside the house and regroup to make a plan. We make our plan. I hear myself saying: \\u201cYou have to keep the windows rolled up. You cannot stop for anything. You have to drive fast until we get to where we\\u2019re going.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know where our destination is. I don\\u2019t know why we\\u2019re running from these things, some of which do look human. I don\\u2019t know what our goal is. As we\\u2019re in the mansion, those creatures start to come in. I keep seeing black tar being spit out of their mouths and if the tar touches us, we die. So, we all run out of the house. We have a new white van because the old one got really beat up and just didn\\u2019t work anymore. So we all pile into this white van. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, everyone roll up the windows. Donny, go as fast as you can. Don\\u2019t stop for anyone or anything. Just keep going.\\u201d This is the part where we drive through multiple scenes or landscapes. At first we\\u2019re driving through a town. When we drive through town, there\\u2019s an Asian man who\\u2019s sitting next to me in the van and he cracks his window a little bit. I start yelling at him because I can see on the right side of the car a pair of twin women with dark hair, but their bodies don\\u2019t move like humans. You can tell they\\u2019re something else. One of them spits on the windshield. Donny wipes the spit off with the windshield wiper fluid. The spit is an orange color. I\\u2019m expecting it to melt through the window at any moment, but it doesn\\u2019t. When Donny uses the windshield wiper fluid and because the guys\\u2019 window is down, some of the fluid comes in through the window and hits his eyes. His eyes start to burn. I look at him and his eyes are the goldish yellow color of the spit. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI told you to keep the window closed. Here\\u2019s another casualty that could have been avoided.\\u201d Donny slows down. These twin women start telling us, \\u201cOkay, if you\\u2019re going to survive this, you have to go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I know!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to tell Donny to go. Now it\\u2019s raining and the pavement is wet. We see the road in front of us is blocked by some of these things or people that are trying to get us. Donny swerves off and he goes over a railroad track. I don\\u2019t know how the van makes it over the railroad track. He swerves around this big piece of metal in our path. Then he swerves around other people and other cars. We\\u2019re going through forests. We seem to be under attack this whole time. There are a couple children in the van with us. We\\u2019re really trying to keep those children safe. This is part of the whole mission, though I have no idea what the point of this mission is. It\\u2019s really wild and there\\u2019s a lot of pressure.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outside in a city which has a mix of futuristic tall buildings and older style brick ones. I\\u2019m walking down a street. To my right is a bridge going over water and also a boardwalk. I don\\u2019t know if the water is lake or ocean, but I just know there\\u2019s water off to my right. There are these big crowds of people because there\\u2019s a marathon or a parade happening. I\\u2019m walking through it one direction. Then I get to a point and have to turn around. Now the water is on my left and I start running like I\\u2019m in the parade or marathon. I think veterans are running and people on the sidelines are cheering them on. I\\u2019m running to this shop in one of the older buildings. The shop is run by my friend. She\\u2019s doing a clearance or inventory reduction sale. I\\u2019m helping her carry racks of clothes out the backdoor of the shop and down two sets of stairs to what would be the basement but it\\u2019s outside. So I go out the backdoor of the shop and these steps are outside. I walk down one flight, hit a landing, walk down a second flight and hit another landing. This second landing is below ground but it\\u2019s open, and there\\u2019s a door that goes into her basement. My head is at street level now, so when I look up I can see everybody\\u2019s feet. There are a bunch of younger women who are dancers, singers and artists. The shop owner is like, \\u201cYeah, come get some of this inventory.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s charging them less or giving them away for free. I\\u2019m just carrying this rack of clothes down and putting it down, and I see all these young women and they\\u2019re all adorable and gorgeous. One of them is Maria. She\\u2019s wearing all black and she has this black hat on sideways. These young women are singing while they\\u2019re going through the clothes. I\\u2019m surprised to see Maria and surprised to hear the singing. I kind of wnat to join in but I don\\u2019t know the words. The scene changes with them all rummaging through and Maria leaving - she saw me and was like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m out.\\u201d So then the scene changes to another outdoor area - a food truck area. I see a bunch of friends from high school around an outdoor table. The table is round. My friend Janet is there - she\\u2019s half Japanese and half German. There are also some younger men who I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m observing that the women are doing that thing they do to get attention from the men and the men are loud and boisterous. Everyone is younger than me. Janet goes up to order food. It\\u2019s a Latino food truck with all these sauces and a version of falafel which I understand is not Mexican food or anything. She\\u2019s grabbing her meal and Maria shows up again. It\\u2019s interesting, when Maria shows up, everyone gets quiet. She starts talking and giving directions and instructions and they listen to her. There\\u2019s also a leader of this group somewhere who\\u2019s teaching or telling everyone what to do. All of a sudden I get a feeling that things are getting covert because whatever this leader is saying is on the downlow, so everyone is hush hush, but there are action steps everyone will take to try and correct some sort of wrong that is happening. I\\u2019m not clear on what it is. I just get a sense that some of this stuff is hush hush and the boisterous boys are part of the act. So my friend Janet goes to get her meal and sits down with some other women. Maria starts yelling at her. This whole time I was trying to engage Maria in conversation or engage the other people in conversation and I\\u2019m not getting a lot of back and forth. So I notice that Maria starts yelling at Janet and she\\u2019s sharp. She feels pretty sinister at this point and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow, I don\\u2019t know who that is actually.\\u201d I leave that table and go to a hallway that\\u2019s like a hallway to some bathrooms. I\\u2019m in the hallway and talking with one of the guys. At some point I see Maria again. She either follows me in or I come out of this hallway and she\\u2019s there. She just keeps trying to avoid me, which is funny because at this point I\\u2019m not seeking her out; I\\u2019m just minding my own business because she\\u2019s made it really clear that she doesn\\u2019t want to talk to me and I\\u2019ve seen that she\\u2019s not the person I thought. That black hat she was wearing earlier, she\\u2019s still wearing but it\\u2019s tilted so that you can only see part of her face - classic villain-esse style. I leave this food truck area because I\\u2019m hungry and I can\\u2019t eat what\\u2019s at the food truck. I go down the street a little bit and there\\u2019s a restaurant with Viking food - that\\u2019s how it\\u2019s advertised. So I go inside and read the menu. They have paleo donuts and I\\u2019m sold. I\\u2019m flipping through the rest of the menu and it\\u2019s Chinese and Thai food and all this international cuisine that is definitely not Viking food. My friend Janet shows up at the restaurant and says, \\u201cOh, I will eat here with you.\\u201d She ends up not being able to eat her meal at the food truck because Maria ate part of it and then threw the rest of it in her face. She sees the paleo donuts and is like, \\u201cYep, I\\u2019m down.\\u201d We go to sit down and order more food. I\\u2019m flipping through the menu and seeing Asian food and stuff. I look up and the inside of the restaurant has really tall ceilings and really tall windows that look out towards the street where there are passersby. There\\u2019s a counter in the back, but it\\u2019s open so you can see the cooks working in the kitchen. I can see two chefs standing at the front counter. There\\u2019s a glass case and I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s food or what in it. They\\u2019re standing waiting for our order. I know I ordered the little paleo donut thing. I think Janet tries to order something, but Maria shows up again and drags her out of the restaurant.\"],[\"I walk into a room, like an acupuncturist's treatment room. I can see rice screens in the background. I\\u2019m there to see a healer. It looks like a cross between a Master Healer and an ex buddhis monk who I learned meditation from - he left the monastery because he preferred joy. I\\u2019m on the treatment table and facing him. He\\u2019s wearing a light blue robe or shirt. He starts to move his hands like an air bender. I start to fall asleep like the REM healing sleep and there are images coming to mind. I tell myself to remember these images so i can remember them later. Then I go into the deep healing sleep. He\\u2019s still doing the airbender motion in front of my body. I\\u2019m lying on my right side the whole time, almost in the fetal position. He\\u2019s working at chest level - heart and solar plexus energy centers. I have a sense that I\\u2019m asleep for a while. As I come out, my brain kicks in again and tells me to remember the healing images. As I wake up, the healer says: \\u201cTend to your masculine energy child. Look up Libra moon. That\\u2019s what you need for healing.\\u201d I did a deep healing breath as he finished his hand motions - in both my sleep in my dream and my sleep in real life. I woke up in that position - lying on my right side. I had a sense he was removing an energetic entanglement.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with two guys, one of them is Josh. We\\u2019re at a zoo. We\\u2019re looking at the displays and I\\u2019m sad about animals being in the zoo. But, I don't actually see any animals. The displays are all empty. I walk into one of them and am trying to show Josh and the other guy, maybe he\\u2019s my brother, that your eyesight is limited from the point of view of the animal. I\\u2019ve walked into the display area and am looking out to where the crowds would be standing. I say, \\u201cSee you can only see so much if you\\u2019re in here.\\u201d I try to show them this. Then I turn around and it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s an inside part of these displays that opens up into a huge cylinder shaped room that opens up to the sky. Inside are more cages and laboratories and places for the animals. I want to explore this. The other two come in with me. We\\u2019re curious. We don't know exactly what is happening in this area of the zoo. I still can\\u2019t see any animals. Except, as I get closer, I\\u2019m looking at a lot of metal and cages and fluorescent lights. As I\\u2019m looking, these tiny, maybe three inches tall, koala bears show up. They\\u2019re climbing this little bird stand with the wide dish at the bottom for bird seed. There isn't a cage around it, though. The tiny koalas are hyper and all over the place. This scientist zoologist comes out with a black house cat (his familiar?) and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! I want to hold this tiny koala!\\u201d The scientist says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the tiny koala. They\\u2019re on something. I don\\u2019t know what they might do to you. They might bite you. They might scratch you. So just leave them alone.\\u201d So I just look at them. At first there was one, then there were two, then there were like fifty of them swarming this little stand. They are moving kind of crazily. I back up a little bit. We\\u2019re just poking around this inside place and looking for other animals. I get a sense that there are other things we could be doing than this. The scene changes. I don't know what happens to the other two. I\\u2019m in this outdoor area that reminds me of a college campus. There\\u2019s a football team going by. It\\u2019s Fall, leaves are falling, there are leaves on the ground and it\\u2019s kind of chilly. I\\u2019m wearing shorts and a shirt. A lot of the football players are classmates from school, but there are also a bunch of them that I don\\u2019t recognize. As the football team files past me some of them who are my old classmates say hi. They\\u2019re really excited to see me. I realize this is because I\\u2019m wearing velvet bootie shorts and a tiny little crop top. So, they seem like they\\u2019re happy to see me but I think it\\u2019s just because of what I\\u2019m wearing. Somehow I\\u2019m wearing this because it\\u2019s one of those fall days where it\\u2019s still pretty warm in the middle of the day. Apparently the temperature isn\\u2019t bothering me. I turn around and go to this larger grassy area where there are a bunch of people gathered. They\\u2019re all on their own blankets. I go to the spot with a bunch of friends. I don't recognize all the people on the blanket but I get the sense that I know them because they say, \\u201cHey Rose!\\u201d and I sit down and we\\u2019re talking. At one point, Ana shows up with her son. They are so brown - their skin is so dark and they\\u2019re totally naked! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThose two have been out in the sun all summer! I\\u2019m jealous!\\u201d They\\u2019re the only two who are naked. The rest of us have some kind of clothing on. But the thing that stands out is how tan the two of them are. Then, I leave the blanket and go into a house or something. I\\u2019m heading towards the inside and set up a lawn chair for myself. Then someone wants to talk to me and I get distracted and go elsewhere. I do the interaction but don\\u2019t remember what it is. I think it\\u2019s a football player who was one of my old classmates and wants to talk. He tries to convince me to come watch the game or go to some sort of after party. I finish that interaction and go back to sit in my chair, but someone is in my chair. This happens like three times where I go talk to someone and go back to my chair, but the chair I\\u2019ve set up for myself, someone else is in it. The first two times I get a new chair. The third time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYo, that\\u2019s my chair! Get out. I set that up for me.\\u201d The person who is in it this last time is a cranky older gentleman. He maybe needs the chair more than I do. I\\u2019m pissed off about losing my chair yet again, but thinking maybe he actually needs it. Then again, one more football player comes over and wants to talk to me. It\\u2019s like they all want to spend time with me and go on a date. They want me to come to their football games and just be around them. There\\u2019s a funny earnestness and innocence in the way they\\u2019re showing up to try and get my attention. It\\u2019s not creepy at all. They\\u2019re not trying to be players or extra smooth. They just really want me around. They want my energy around. It\\u2019s funny.\"],[\"I am outside. I keep going into a building but I\\u2019m not supposed to be inside because it\\u2019s reserved for other people. A convention or something is happening. I see my hula halau there - my kumu hula and all my hula sisters. They\\u2019re going to do a show. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome dance with us.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and am like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember any of the dances.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don\\u2019t remember the dances. They also don\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s like we haven\\u2019t practiced in a long time and we haven\\u2019t gotten together in a long time. But we\\u2019re all getting together for this. I feel so awkward. It\\u2019s really just affording me a reason for me to be in this building that I need or just want to be in. I\\u2019m not sure why. The halau is getting ready. I think I\\u2019m still in costume. I hide from them. I climb up a balcony or something. I\\u2019m not even taking stairs. I\\u2019m climbing things and definitely trespassing. I get to a classroom and it\\u2019s a kindergarten classroom. All the kindergarten decor is in there. I\\u2019m hiding in there. I think the teacher is trying to get the classroom ready because there aren\\u2019t a lot of kids. But there are some kids, so I think maybe it\\u2019s a school. I need to use the bathroom and it\\u2019s a little kid\\u2019s bathroom so the toilet is just two feet off the ground. I come out and have these feelings that I shouldn\\u2019t be here but don\\u2019t know why I need to be there. I head out of the classroom and climb back down and head back to the hula sisters. We do perform but I don\\u2019t know if I actually perform with them or watch. I wake up with this sense of not knowing what\\u2019s going on, I shouldn\\u2019t be here, I don\\u2019t have the skills, I don\\u2019t remember the dances, and none of this is my scene.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Josh, my beloved. We\\u2019re going to a Dane Cook show - the compedian (I haven\\u2019t listened to his shit in at least ten years). We\\u2019re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It\\u2019s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They\\u2019re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It\\u2019s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he\\u2019s done. I\\u2019m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it\\u2019s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term \\u201csausage fest\\u201d is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I\\u2019m a little confused as to why I\\u2019m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he\\u2019s finished with the set. He\\u2019s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, \\u201cWell, because you\\u2019re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, whatever!\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don\\u2019t know if Josh is still with me. I\\u2019m watching a soccer game. It\\u2019s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They\\u2019re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I\\u2019m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I\\u2019m not playing, I\\u2019m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I\\u2019m not sure who the team is that we\\u2019re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I\\u2019m wanting to play so bad. We\\u2019re outdoors at a soccer field and I\\u2019m actually sitting under a tree, it\\u2019s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I\\u2019m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I\\u2019m not playing and I\\u2019m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I\\u2019m not invited to play and it\\u2019s been a really long time since I\\u2019ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there\\u2019s busy work that has to happen. I\\u2019m watching the field morph. I can\\u2019t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I\\u2019m not part of it and I\\u2019m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don\\u2019t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. There\\u2019s my other friend Nani who I\\u2019ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m busy and I\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d She does sit with me for a little bit. While we\\u2019re sitting there, another girl comes up - I\\u2019m saying \\u201cgirl\\u201d because everyone is a teenager - and she\\u2019s got a project she\\u2019s working on. I ask her to show me. There\\u2019s wire wrapped around a needle and she\\u2019s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: \\u201cI can show you but I\\u2019m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.\\u201d It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s almost off work with the job she\\u2019s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she\\u2019s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, \\u201cOkay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you\\u2019re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.\\u201d She\\u2019s a local girl, so I can feel this air of \\u201cIck, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?\\u201d That\\u2019s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a neighborhood. It\\u2019s very Norman Rockwell style with white picket fences. Everyone has their house decorated for fall with pumpkins on porches and chrysanthemums, but it\\u2019s still warm out. It hasn\\u2019t turned cold yet. The leaves haven\\u2019t changed yet. It\\u2019s late September, maybe. I\\u2019m going through the neighborhood trying to find a pumpkin. I\\u2019m chasing it - it\\u2019s really big. It is bouncing around like a beachball. There are cars that I\\u2019m passing as I run down the roads chasing this pumpkin. It\\u2019s all residential and I\\u2019m chasing it through the neighborhood. I get this sense that someone else is helping me find or get the pumpkin. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m going to do with it once I get it or why I\\u2019m chasing it in the first place. Somewhere in the background I can feel my beloved\\u2019s presence. I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s helping me or what.\"],[\"I am with my ex and his dad and some other family members, maybe some are my family members. I have to go do something but I\\u2019ve forgotten all my stuff. I turn to my ex and ask him to go get the things that I\\u2019m missing. The whole time I\\u2019m asking him, part of me is like, \\u201cWhy are you asking him for things? He can\\u2019t give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to do anything for you. Don\\u2019t ask him. Just do the things. If you do, you\\u2019ll owe him and that will make things worse.\\u201d I keep seeing this backpack full of things. He either has it or I have it, I\\u2019m not entirely sure. He does bring it to me. But the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, don\\u2019t accept this from him because then you will owe and you\\u2019ll never be free of him.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re younger, maybe early twenties. We\\u2019re gathered from all parts of the globe. It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There\\u2019s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cFor all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I signed up to be a bad guy.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We\\u2019re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She\\u2019s down below me and there\\u2019s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I\\u2019m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I\\u2019m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from \\u201cLilo and Stitch.\\u201d She\\u2019s talking to it and petting it while she\\u2019s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn\\u2019t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn\\u2019t have one, but I said, \\u201cThanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.\\u201d He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly understand that this meeting was about who was going to end up with one of those animals, like what she has. She moves on. I stand up and follow her into the kitchen. She\\u2019s moving as if she\\u2019s very busy and has to move onto the next task. The kitchen is also an office and there\\u2019s a huge fish tank. She is already giving instructions to someone else. I come up to her and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one of those things that you guys can create for me.\\u201d She stops talking and has a grin on her face and is like, \\u201cWell actually, you my dear, have enough power for three of these.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little taken aback and surprised. This woman has dark hair and reminds me a little bit of Helen but she\\u2019s not. They correlate to emotional superpowers, one is my ability to laugh and smile - at some point this thing smiled at me with all its sharp pointy teeth. She says, \\u201cYes, and you have two others.\\u201d There's something about shadow and something about fighting, warrior spirit. We all pile into cars and drive somewhere. I\\u2019m with my friend from the grocery store. We drive to a large gathering for all of us.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outdoors somewhere and there are a bunch of homeless people. I think it might be a homeless camp. I think there\\u2019s a river nearby. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m there because initially I was supposed to go and help move them from where they were. But when I get there, I realize they just need a home and supplies and they just need to be taken care of. I give them whatever supplies I have in my car and end up leaving the car there (I think it\\u2019s the Chevy Volt that I have). I also have my kids with me, I think. We head towards a big farmhouse down the dirt road. There are fields of grass and fences along the side. We get to the house. It belongs to somebody I know, maybe my parents. Now I have my kids and my daughter\\u2019s friend. Josh is there, too. I\\u2019m getting something ready for all of us and I keep remembering one more thing, then one more thing, then one more thing. Eventually Josh is like, \\u201cWe gotta go.\\u2019 He takes the kids and puts them all in the car then drives off. I have this funny little Chevy Volt, a tiny tiny car, and it\\u2019s left for me to drive. It actually looks more like a Flinstone\\u2019s car. I keep gathering stuff up and as I\\u2019m heading out the door I see all these northern flicker feathers (they are orange on one side and black on the other) and some black and white feathers that look like striped zebras. They\\u2019re so many of them as I\\u2019m trying to get in the car. I keep hearing the ancestors saying, \\u201cPick them up. Those offerings are for you. Pick them up.\\u201d There are maybe twelve feathers and they\\u2019re actually longer than flicker feathers because they\\u2019re the length of my forearm. I keep picking them up and picking them up, and wondering what does all this mean and why are there so many feathers. In the meantime, I\\u2019m thinking in the background that I have to go and I have to catch up with Josh and the kids. I\\u2019ve gotta get going, but I\\u2019m picking up these feathers and it\\u2019s so important that I have them and I keep them with me in this Flinstone\\u2019s car that I\\u2019m driving. The dream ends with me gathering up the last of them and trying to get in the car.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to this party or dance. I distinctly remember feeling like I did in high school when I was getting ready for high school dances - the anticipation and excitement. This dance is a larger party. I know I\\u2019m going to see my friend Janet from high school. I\\u2019m really excited about it. I walk into the house where it\\u2019s at and she\\u2019s right in the foyer. We\\u2019re both so happy to see each other. We throw our hands up in the air and hug each other hello. It\\u2019s so good to see her. Janet is shorter than me. I haven\\u2019t seen her in at least ten years. She\\u2019s happy to see me. I\\u2019m happy to see her. I\\u2019m a little bit surprised that she\\u2019s happy to see me, but it\\u2019s fun to be reunited. Then I go into the rest of the party. It\\u2019s interesting because I don\\u2019t really know the rest of the people there. I\\u2019m mingling and having a good time. Then my beloved Josh is there. I don\\u2019t know if I came with him or not. But he\\u2019s there and hitting on chicks, getting to know people as he does. I see him take one off to go fuck or do whatever they do. I say something to him like, \\u201cHey, take the condom.\\u201d I watch them go off. Then I turn around and look for anyone I\\u2019d like to fuck. I think not really. Some of them are old high school classmates, but others I don\\u2019t know. Interesting thing is, this house is owned by my friend\\u2019s ex. He owns the house and he\\u2019s the host. He has all this money and the house is really big with tall windows. The living room is really open and the windows slide open like patio doors, but they\\u2019re taller than patio doors. You can see that his yard is gorgeous and two houses down is an empty lot. New houses are being built there. There\\u2019s water off the backside of this house - it\\u2019s a canal of some sort. The party is still happening and I go out the front doors to the garden. The garden looks a lot like my old garden in Corvallis where I had turned over the soil and made the garden a small section of the front yard, so I could still have a path. I go over to the soil. There\\u2019s a bunch of little kids and it\\u2019s like a Waldorf school is having an outdoor class and they\\u2019re learning about gardening. But this area where the garden is has big holes like a dog had been digging. It\\u2019s dug down to where there\\u2019s black plastic that has been put down to create a barrier between where there was grass and all the new rich nutrients that had been put on top. There\\u2019s nothing growing in the garden right now; it\\u2019s just the black dirt and mulch and all these holes. I look into all the holes and all of them have something slightly different in them. One hole has pens, one hole has an old dog leash and collar, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think we want those in there if we\\u2019re going to be growing stuff.\\u201d I reach down to grab these things out. The kids are very intently looking to see what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m just removing the trash from this garden area that hasn\\u2019t been used. It needs clean up, that\\u2019s for sure, and nothing is growing in it. I have a recollection of the owner of the lot saying, \\u201cOh yeah, I think I should just buy this other lot two houses down, then I can have an even bigger house.\\u201d The way he says it, he\\u2019s being a pompous ass. I don\\u2019t get it. I don\\u2019t know who he\\u2019s showing off for and I don\\u2019t know why he needs another house two houses down.\"],[\"I am hosting a party. I\\u2019m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There\\u2019s a fireplace. There\\u2019s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I\\u2019m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We\\u2019re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they\\u2019re here at the party for a reason, but there\\u2019s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don\\u2019t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what\\u2019s up. They\\u2019ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There\\u2019s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what\\u2019s being discussed, but it seems like there\\u2019s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don\\u2019t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what\\u2019s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we\\u2019ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. Let\\u2019s do that. We\\u2019ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.\\u201d It must be cold outside because there\\u2019s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What\\u2019s funny is they didn\\u2019t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it\\u2019s freezing. So there\\u2019s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don\\u2019t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they\\u2019ll put them near the fire. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I\\u2019ll just go put them in the fire.\\u201d But the shoes don\\u2019t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they\\u2019re wearing are mismatched. There\\u2019s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There\\u2019s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I\\u2019m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It\\u2019s like somehow we\\u2019ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it\\u2019s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they\\u2019re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it\\u2019s just me in the end. I\\u2019m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can\\u2019t remember what the changes are now. I\\u2019m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I\\u2019m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not a good idea. You\\u2019re a woman, this isn\\u2019t a good idea for you.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they\\u2019re leaving telling him: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She\\u2019s going to do what she\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn\\u2019t have to say and stop trying to control her. I\\u2019m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn\\u2019t being heard by my dad. I couldn\\u2019t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I\\u2019m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I\\u2019m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss\\u2019 artwork but the customer\\u2019s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I\\u2019m printing it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t your artwork.\\u201d She comes and looks at it and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely not.\\u201d There are huge instructions in the order and I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cNo. We don\\u2019t print other people\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m not going to do this.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d We look over and there are packages with more of this customer\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.\\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I\\u2019m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they\\u2019re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, \\u201cOh, who is that?!\\u201d My friend is there, too, and I think she\\u2019s in the room with somebody, but she\\u2019s not because she\\u2019s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn\\u2019t her. We\\u2019re all like, \\u201cWho was that?!\\u201d We walk down the hall and it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don\\u2019t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey can I get one of those? I want a turn!\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he\\u2019s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I look at him like, \\u201cCan I get a turn?\\u201d and he blushes and is like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the living room of my childhood home. There are a ton of people coming and going; some of them are my siblings, some are my siblings\\u2019 classmates, and I think some are my classmates, too. They\\u2019re all on a mission of some sort. I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing, but they\\u2019re coming home from some event they were at or some project they were doing. There are a lot of people, at least twenty, in the living room and more people outside. At one point I see a huge outrigger canoe being rolled through the yard and into the living room, which magically expands to fit it. I\\u2019m lying on a couch and pretty tired. I\\u2019m exhausted and just watching them come and go. People are stopping to talk with me but I\\u2019m not really involved in whatever is happening or whatever mission they seem to be on. At one point I sit up and look out to the driveway and the hedge that separates our house from the neighbor house. Behind the hedge is a gigantic tree with a treehouse in it. It looks like an oak tree in the way the trunk and branches are growing but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an oak because this is Hawaii. I\\u2019m watching people climb up and down the tree - it\\u2019s a treehouse but also an obstacle course with places where you can work out. It\\u2019s all somehow in this tree. I\\u2019m watching other people working out. Then I see a real tiger, orange and black, climb the tree and do the workout. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhoa, I didn\\u2019t know tigers could move like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m watching the tiger the whole time because I\\u2019m fascinated by what it\\u2019s doing and how it can do it, and also that it seems to be listening to the people. It\\u2019s as if it\\u2019s taking instructions from the humans - maybe not verbally, but from watching and then doing what they\\u2019re doing. Then the tiger climbs out of the tree and I think it\\u2019s going into the house through the backdoor. It\\u2019s at the backdoor and doing pullups on this pullup bar in the door. I see my brother (the one with the sustained traumatic brain injury in real life, but in the dream he\\u2019s normal and doesn\\u2019t have it). He is trying to pick up the tiger and use the tiger as a weight. The tiger is getting pissed off about this and doesn\\u2019t like it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMaybe you should put the tiger down.\\u201d He figures it out on his own. This whole time, the tiger is the most fascinating thing even though there are other people around. The tiger is acting like a tiger but also like a human. At some point it does come up to me and I just look at it and it looks at me, but I don\\u2019t hear anything and it doesn\\u2019t give me any verbal messages. I just know we have a moment of looking at each other. This part of the dream dissolves. Now I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood. I\\u2019m young, maybe five or six. There are two houses. I go into one house and there are a bunch of younger kids and two dads. I\\u2019m now my current age. The moms are not there and the dads don\\u2019t know how to feed the kids. They\\u2019re both watching tv, but then they see me and are like, \\u201cOh good! A woman to take care of things.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? No.\\u201d I walk out of the house. Then I walk down the street in this neighborhood -I\\u2019m definitely in the suburbs. I walk into the second house. This house is dark and dingy. There\\u2019s at least one man in here and maybe some kids. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw, danger.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to be in there. I can tell it\\u2019s not the place for me. There\\u2019s nothing here for me. This whole time I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood, I\\u2019m looking for something but I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m looking for. I do know that this house is not it. I leave that house and go back to the other house. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well I guess I will help you guys out because you\\u2019re better than the other house.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat, we need a pie made.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOkay, well show me all the stuff.\\u201d As soon as I say yes to making the pie, the dads pulls out this box of frozen foods they weren\\u2019t feeding the kids until they had permission from me. It\\u2019s a box of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fish sticks and frozen pizzas - basically junk food. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat now we can eat all this stuff and feed the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh god, this is a terrible idea. Where is the stuff to make the pie. I\\u2019ll make the pie and at least that will be good.\\u201d They show me this piece of cardboard with perforated cutouts of leaves and vines. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with it but I start pushing those through because I think I\\u2019ll maybe use them for the pie. Then the dads want to start talking business and how they\\u2019re going to pay me for this work. They hand me a leather jump rope with wooden handles. It\\u2019s folded four times. I have it in my hands and they\\u2019re talking about payment. As I\\u2019m listening I think they\\u2019ve got it all wrong. They don\\u2019t know how much labor is worth or how the pay schedule works. I\\u2019m talking about financial investments and using the jump rope to help explain. I\\u2019m untying the rope to show them how payment works. This is the most bizarre part of the dream because I don\\u2019t remember what I was saying or how a jump rope relates to finance, but somehow it did.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Aila and dropping her kids off at her house. I have my kids with me, too. We come up to the front drive. I head inside with both of them to say goodbye. She\\u2019s mother henning me and fussing with me and wanting to give me all kinds of things and make sure I have enough food adn things to take home with me. I say goodbye to her two kids who are now lying on the couch. I see how she welcomes them home and they\\u2019re so happy to see her. She has things to hand them and things for them to do to keep them occupied and things for them to do together as a family. I\\u2019m following her around her house and it doesn\\u2019t look like her actual home in this realm, but it is her home. I follow her into the kitchen and she gives me food and tea and makes sure I\\u2019m warm. Then I go to leave and am saying my goodbyes. I walk out the back door and start going down this road, but I realize I left my car in her front yard parked next to her car. I\\u2019m heading down this road and it\\u2019s really comfortable and gorgeous - it\\u2019s where I\\u2019d rather be. Halfway down the road I realize I need to turn around and go get my car. So, I turn around and head back to her house. I\\u2019m coming up to the house from the back. It\\u2019s got a lot of outbuildings and this is the side of the house that isn\\u2019t used for very much. Austin is there, too - her partner, a big tall cowboy. He says hi to me and we spend a little time together. As I come back up to the house I see that she\\u2019s with our other friend Beth. They\\u2019re looking for articles of clothing for a photoshoot. Beth has all these cute pieces, but they look like they\\u2019re from a thrift shop - like big floral skirts made out of sheets. I am admiring and remarking on how those two can make anything fashionable, including old sheets, for photoshoots and whatnot. I can also tell I\\u2019m in the way, so I\\u2019m trying to go through the house and out the front door to my car. Aila is still super hospitable and saying hello. She has other things set up for the kids; I think they\\u2019re watching a show or something. The show is a documentary on anti-racism work or something like that. She\\u2019s so welcoming, even though I\\u2019m back at her house after having gone the wrong way and taking my leave. I feel super awkward and I can tell her that her and Beth have some business to do, and I\\u2019m the way of that, too. I\\u2019m trying to go out the front door so I can get to my car. I stop and say goodbye to Austin. I\\u2019m on the porch and saying goodbye again and really wanting to take my leave so I can get out of her hair. But she\\u2019s still so welcoming. I do hop in my car and leave and drive off on this other road that is parallel to the one in the back. I don\\u2019t like this front road as much. It\\u2019s a busy street and I just don\\u2019t feel as comfortable out on this road.\"],[\"I am in a parking lot. I think it's where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I\\u2019ve driven there for something, I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m reversed into a parking stall and I\\u2019m not sure what kind of car mine is. There\\u2019s another call a few stalls down, I think it\\u2019s a black Honda Civic. Then a few parking stalls down are a bunch of construction workers working on something. There are cut pieces of wood and sawdust everywhere. I\\u2019m not sure what they\\u2019re working on but they\\u2019re in my psychic space, making noise and part of the dream, but I\\u2019m not too focused on them, except trying to make sure I stay out of their way. I\\u2019m going through stuff in the trunk of my car. I\\u2019m rummaging through it and trying to reorganize everything. I have bags with clothes and shoes and all kinds of things in the car. So I\\u2019m trying to find something but also trying to reorganize everything. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding stuff and I realize it\\u2019s because I\\u2019m looking in the other car, my boss\\u2019 car, the black Honda Civic. I\\u2019m in the trunk of that one. There\\u2019s a pair of black high heels with bows on the front - they\\u2019re not mine, they\\u2019re hers. I\\u2019m moving them around and hen I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWait a second, no wonder I can\\u2019t find anything, I\\u2019m in the wrong car.\\u201d So I go back to my car and I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes or something. My car is broken down. I finish rummaging in the back then go up to this kiosk in the parking lot. It\\u2019s a place where you can write a claim so you can get your car fixed. There are a bunch of other people around - a family with some kids and an older lady with white hair. They\\u2019ve all already written claims and are waiting for the next step or they\\u2019re waiting in line to write their claims. It\\u2019s kind of crowded. There\\u2019s a younger woman behind the desk at the kiosk. She\\u2019s telling everybody what to do, where to go, and what to fill out. She gives me this ticket and I go to fill it out but the ticket is printed wrong. The places where you put your name and address are tilted on the ticket and not in a straight line. And the background of the ticket, instead of being blank has a watermark that is repeated along the whole ticket, so it\\u2019s hard to write anything down. I\\u2019m looking at the ticket and looking at her and am like, \\u201cIs this the thing I need to get my car fixed? Will this help?\\u201d This parking for this gigantic building, almost a skyscraper. To the left of the kiosk is this skyscraper and to my right is a hedge. It\\u2019s like this is a parking lot where you can park then go walk downtown. I\\u2019m noticing the trees. The trees are red, so it\\u2019s fall. It\\u2019s a somewhat disjointed dream because it\\u2019s an urban landscape and I don\\u2019t really know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m trying to get accomplished. I think I'm trying to get my car fixed. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m with Josh and two other people, I\\u2019m not sure who they are. We\\u2019re in this futuristic seeming town or city. The colors are white and blue, all different shades of lighter blue. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. Josh just decides he\\u2019s totally horny and grabs me by the hips and bends me over so he can fuck me from behind. But we\\u2019re on the street and on a set of stairs going up to a building. The buildings are low, not skyscrapers. There are no plants anywhere, but if there are, they are shades of white and blue. There\\u2019s just this entrance to a building where we stop at. I think that maybe we\\u2019re traveling with this other couple but I\\u2019m not sure where and I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re doing.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching my daughter from the edges of an ice rink. She\\u2019s ice skating and doing a show. I think we were there for practice but it ends up being a show. She\\u2019s in costume. There are a bunch of other ice skaters who are her teammates. They\\u2019re on the ice in the background. Then there\\u2019s one male ice skater. The others are all lined up and my daughter is in front of them. The one male ice skater comes around and as part of the show pulls her jacket off down around her arms and her body is that of a full grown woman. It\\u2019s a very sexual sensual move and I\\u2019m pissed off because she\\u2019s still a thirteen year old and she\\u2019s being super hyper sexualized in this show. I\\u2019m so mad. Her coaches are there critiquing because it is a rehearsal for the show. My daughter skates forward to do her move and something happens that I don\\u2019t quite see and she falls to the ice. Something happens to one of her legs. I\\u2019m so mad and I go grab her to make sure she\\u2019s okay. But this is not an appropriate show for a young girl to be doing. Then everybody goes home. I have her and her brother, too. Their dad is there, too. He\\u2019s been watching. I\\u2019m trying to spend time with the two kids because I haven\\u2019t seen them in a long time. I gather them both up in my arms and hold onto them and snuggle them. Their dad leaves and gives me some time with me. I try to connect. It\\u2019s a little awkward but there is some connection. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to go,\\u201d and he takes the kids with him. I\\u2019m following them out. We head out of the building where the ice skating rink is. Now I\\u2019m in this marina, so there are boats and everyone has a dock for their boats. The boats are coming back and forth, but people are also swimming in the water. There are set times when there are no boats and people can swim. Then there is time for the boats when you can\\u2019t swim because you\\u2019d get run over. I\\u2019m showing some of the kids in our group how to swim. I\\u2019m not sure who all is with us. A few people in their boats start to go boating when it\\u2019s still swimming time. People are yelling at the swimmers to get out of the water so they don\\u2019t get run over. I see this boat coming right up the lane and I flatten myself as much as I can on the floor of the marina - I think it\\u2019s a lake floor - so I don\\u2019t get chopped up by their propellers. I get up and people start dragging me out of the water once the boat passes over. I\\u2019m horrified that no one is being careful and that we\\u2019re in the water while boating is happening. We get out of the water. Somebody\\u2019s wedding is being prepped and they\\u2019ve asked me as a friend to come and help with it. Each of their friends are taking turns helping with the wedding. I think each of us has a day that we\\u2019re helping to prep. I get my day and I have a list. I don\\u2019t know who these friends are and I don\\u2019t even know who the friends of the friends are. It's a very strange situation because I don't know who I was just partying with at the marina and I don\\u2019t know whose wedding this is. I get a list of all the things that have been assigned to me to prep for this wedding. I walk through this door that will be the aisle we walk down, but the timing is bad because when we walk through it sets off an alarm that downs a bunch of trees right over the entrance and blocks it. It\\u2019s like when a castle is under siege and you\\u2019re pulling oil over people\\u2019s heads. The building or place has a protection mechanism; it reminds me of Hogwarts in the last movie. So all these trees come down right in front of me. The couple who is getting married is like, \\u201cThere goes my aisle to walk down.\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll clean up the trees and the other people can do the other stuff on the list.\\u201d I go to do that, but I think I get interrupted. Someone stops me to help them with something, but I go, \\u201cYeah, but I really have to move these trees.\\u201d The trees were dead to begin with and they weren\\u2019t actually trees, they were really big logs that have come across this doorway. The doorway is little; it\\u2019s like a one person doorway that you would go in and out of, say through your bedroom or something. But there is a red carpet that leads out from it, but now it\\u2019s covered in logs. These logs are white, either birch or aspen that have been cut and fallen. This dream ends with me being pulled away from this job to assist the bride. I\\u2019m sitting in a circle on a bench and there\\u2019s a woman with a white dress on. Her train is huge and beautiful. Her dress is very beautiful and sparkly, probably with sequins.\"],[\"I\\u2019m looking at my phone and I\\u2019m with Josh and getting texts from Hank. Hank and Wendy used to co-own the CrossFit gym I used to go to. Hank is texting me about meeting up with him. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with him and think it\\u2019s weird that he\\u2019s even texting me. I say yes even though I don\\u2019t know what he wants. The scene shifts from me looking at my phone to being at a coffee shop. I\\u2019m with Josh and we\\u2019re hanging out. I have this feeling that Hank is going to meet up with me here and Wend6 is going to be there, too. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with them and don\\u2019t know why I agreed to meet with them. But I very distinctly remember seeing the text message where I said, \\u201cOkay great,\\u201d to Hank\\u2019s request to meet me somewhere. They both show up. I see Wendy first. She doesn\\u2019t seem like herself. She\\u2019s actually really happy and her hair is dyed blond. She has a smile on her face. She says hi to me. I\\u2019m wary like who is this and why is she saying hi. But she says hi then goes on with her business. She has her kids and she\\u2019s meeting a friend. Hank shows up and goes to give me a creepy hug like he used to give me. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh don\\u2019t, Josh is right there and he\\u2019s not going to like that. I don\\u2019t even know why I\\u2019m meeting with you and why I said yes. Don\\u2019t hug me in that creepy way.\\u201d The hug is like the lingering kind with lingering hands. Hank is also really happy to see me. I\\u2019m hesitant and I can see that Josh is wondering what\\u2019s going on here. Josh is looking less and less like himself as the dream progresses. He\\u2019s sitting at a table sitting out towards the coffee shop on a bench. There\\u2019s a chair on the other side of the table facing him and the chair is where I was going to sit, but that\\u2019s where Hank wants to sit and talk. I have all this hesitation about meeting up with them. Then the scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a Jeep. I'm driving around. It\\u2019s either Wendy\\u2019s or somebody\\u2019s. Josh is in the passenger seat and he\\u2019s upset and is like, \\u201cWhy did you meet with them?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember the gist of the conversation, just the feeling that he wasn\\u2019t happy with me and I was confused that I would agree to meet with them and confused by their super friendly reaction to me when I don\\u2019t think they would be friendly in real life.\"],[\"There are three or four black women, I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re actresses. They\\u2019re going on stage. One is stunningly beautiful and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who needs to be on stage.\\u201d I keep wanting to build her up and make sure she knows how beautiful she is. For some reason she\\u2019s not seeing how beautiful she is. I\\u2019m trying to convince her through showing her.Then I have berries which look like blueberries. I\\u2019ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don\\u2019t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I\\u2019m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don\\u2019t know who. I\\u2019m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I\\u2019m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it\\u2019s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard. I can see this cartoonish looking town through the branches and it\\u2019s dark and there are lights on. The roads are very hilly and windy.\"],[\"I am talking to a detective who I\\u2019m hiring to go watch my ex-father-in-law and my dad who are supposed to be taking turns watching my son who is an infant. They\\u2019re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don\\u2019t work. The reason I\\u2019m hiring this detective is because I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re watching my son very well and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s entirely safe. They\\u2019re watching him for me because I\\u2019m working and I don\\u2019t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They\\u2019re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It\\u2019s odd that they\\u2019re together because they don\\u2019t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they\\u2019re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who\\u2019s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they\\u2019re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I\\u2019m observing this whole thing. I\\u2019m on the pool deck somewhere but they don\\u2019t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They\\u2019re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you\\u2019re both talking shit about me and the fact that I\\u2019m not around to watch my son and it\\u2019s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I\\u2019m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can\\u2019t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law\\u2019s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn\\u2019t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.\\u201d My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There\\u2019s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I\\u2019m having them watch my son in the first place. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson\\u2019s mom to him. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I\\u2019m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, \\u201cPick a spot.\\u201d All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that\\u2019s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don\\u2019t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it\\u2019s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they\\u2019re taking the exam. I don\\u2019t have my books. In fact I didn\\u2019t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I\\u2019m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don\\u2019t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I\\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don\\u2019t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn\\u2019t miss too much and I could just get someone else\\u2019s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.\"],[\"I was at a beach with a couple of friends and the only one I recognize is my friend, who is a lifestyle dom and I\\u2019ve really had a good time observing her and working with her and getting to know about being a dom from her. In the dream we are at the ocean. We\\u2019re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it\\u2019s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I\\u2019m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She\\u2019s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We\\u2019re on a culdesac. It\\u2019s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I\\u2019m not sure whose. I\\u2019m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it\\u2019s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I\\u2019m not sure. There are adults and kids. I\\u2019m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I\\u2019m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I\\u2019m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cCould you hurry up? You\\u2019re taking a long time and why do you need that?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBecause I like it.\\u201d Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn\\u2019t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don\\u2019t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there\\u2019s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn\\u2019t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, \\u201cWhy am I taking off this thing that I like?\\u201d I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn\\u2019t like it and was all judgmental about it. The dream ends there with that going through my head.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a friend from the pole studio and we\\u2019re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it\\u2019s not even a possibility for me. We\\u2019re both running around looking for a pole to buy that\\u2019s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It\\u2019s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there\\u2019s no place to workout. We\\u2019re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it\\u2019s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can\\u2019t find what we\\u2019re looking for. I dream some more but don\\u2019t remember what it was. Suddenly I\\u2019m with a Native American man. He\\u2019s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I\\u2019m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don\\u2019t recognize anybody I\\u2019m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they\\u2019ve bonded somehow. I\\u2019m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We\\u2019re in the forest somewhere. He\\u2019s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, \\u201cYou have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why that\\u2019s important but that\\u2019s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I\\u2019m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we\\u2019re protesting capitalism, basically. We\\u2019re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We\\u2019re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that\\u2019s happening with these young kids and how they\\u2019re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh are we going to go in and stop them?\\u201d but the man is like, \\u201cNope, we\\u2019re just going to listen and we\\u2019re going to make food.\\u201d We\\u2019re making food to bring. There\\u2019s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it\\u2019s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I\\u2019m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We\\u2019re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that\\u2019s different from what\\u2019s being taught and told about at this parade. We\\u2019re doing a silent protest. I\\u2019m freaking out because it\\u2019s children that they\\u2019re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can\\u2019t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It\\u2019s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that\\u2019s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we\\u2019re seeing or if we\\u2019re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there\\u2019s this younger dad who\\u2019s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that\\u2019s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, \\u201cYou have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn\\u2019t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, \\u201cOh, I have magic powers? I\\u2019m going to show you my magic powers.\\u201d All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don\\u2019t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it\\u2019s hurting my people and other people. He\\u2019s just so enraged, he\\u2019s lost it. He doesn\\u2019t care who he hurts. I\\u2019m horrified because I\\u2019m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can\\u2019t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won\\u2019t stop. I finally go, \\u201cOkay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What\\u2019s really going on?\\u201d He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won\\u2019t talk to him and he hasn\\u2019t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she\\u2019s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it\\u2019s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, \\u201cAre you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?\\u201d He\\u2019s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they\\u2019re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he\\u2019s so hurt and wounded. We\\u2019re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we\\u2019re conversing we\\u2019re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He\\u2019s an older man, he\\u2019s bald and he\\u2019s wearing all black. He says to me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.\\u201d For whatever reason I see him and am like, \\u201cOh my god, oh no.\\u201d I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I\\u2019m in a towel, I don\\u2019t have my clothes on and don\\u2019t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I\\u2019m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It\\u2019s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn\\u2019t warn them and don\\u2019t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I\\u2019m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don\\u2019t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn\\u2019t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that\\u2019s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren\\u2019t even ground up. I\\u2019m eating in a safe place where this man can\\u2019t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.\\u201d I need to get clothes but I\\u2019m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don\\u2019t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m pretty incoherent. I haven\\u2019t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they\\u2019re part of the oppressor group.\"],[\"I am with one high school classmate, Janet, and some others - somebody\\u2019s parents and some other friends. We\\u2019re going to a park where we can camp and there\\u2019s also a house and cabins you can rent. We\\u2019re celebrating something. It\\u2019s very chill. There\\u2019s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there\\u2019s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you\\u2019d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you\\u2019d dive right onto the slide. It\\u2019s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it\\u2019s like a forest. There\\u2019s also an open area. We\\u2019re there celebrating and I\\u2019m actually starting to get concerned because I\\u2019m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it\\u2019s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, \\u201cUh, coronavirus is up and we\\u2019re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.\\u201d When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I\\u2019m wading into the water. I\\u2019m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it\\u2019s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it\\u2019s a shiny burnt orange color. I don\\u2019t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I\\u2019m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I\\u2019m getting uncomfortable because I\\u2019m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there\\u2019s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It\\u2019s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it\\u2019s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out. The water is pretty warm but when I come out, it\\u2019s cold, like about to start snowing cold. I bundle myself up and head back to the house that we rented. Now there are way more people in it. I\\u2019m crawling into a bed because I\\u2019m freezing. I\\u2019m first there by myself, but then all these other people show up and they crawl into the bed with me. The other people are older, like aunties and uncles and even grandmas. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope.\\u201d The sun has gone down. I change clothes so I\\u2019m warm and I go out of the house. There\\u2019s this guy, I don\\u2019t know him, maybe in his thirties with short dark hair. I noticed him by the pond earlier because he was there doing some work and he had this bronze statue of himself that was animated. He had made a copy of himself that was helping him with a project down there. When I come out of the house, he\\u2019s by the house with his bronze copy of himself. But the copy is misbehaving, it won\\u2019t do what he tells it to do. He\\u2019s trying to kill it and chop off its head in pieces. I\\u2019m a little freaked out by the whole thing because I get this eerie feeling that if he doesn\\u2019t do something about that copy of himself it\\u2019s going to wreak havoc on everybody and just start killing everyone. At some point, he manages to get control of it and chops it into pieces and puts it on a tarp and wraps the tarp up. I\\u2019m kind of grossed out by the whole thing. I don\\u2019t know what he does with the tarp. He\\u2019s definitely a musician because i see him go from there to setting up a ritual space. He brings all the elements in. He has rings on his fingers. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing and what he\\u2019s setting up. The dream shifts. I end up traveling somewhere else. I\\u2019m traveling with Josh. he\\u2019s feeling super beat down and his self esteem is in the toilet. He\\u2019s picking at acne on his body so badly that it\\u2019s leaving holes in his skin. He\\u2019s super fucking depressed. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re traveling to or from. I don\\u2019t even know what kind of vehicle we\\u2019re in but there are seats. I\\u2019m in a seat and he\\u2019s in a seat next to me. There\\u2019s seaglass, round and smooth, and some are pretty big like the size of the palm of my hand. They\\u2019re all different colors, red and purple and greens and blues. There are smaller pieces, too. It\\u2019s gorgeous and it\\u2019s his personal collection. I\\u2019m trying to hang onto this glass while we\\u2019re in this vehicle. At some point we\\u2019re flying because I look out the window and see clouds below us, but we\\u2019re also driving. I put the glass down and all of a sudden the vehicle accelerates and the glass falls off the shelf I put it on and shatters into so many tiny pieces on the metal of the floor of this vehicle. Josh is ambivalent about it and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, all of your glass!\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified because I put it there and it broke, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really care.\\u201d I\\u2019m super upset about it breaking and I feel bad. I\\u2019m also upset that he doesn\\u2019t care. I sweep up all the little shards and we put them in the trash. There are a few tiny pieces left and I gather those up and hang onto them. We get to where we\\u2019re going and we get out of this vehicle. We end up at a weird saloon bar place. It\\u2019s dark. We meet these two women who I think were our travel companions at one point. I don\\u2019t know who they are but they\\u2019re familiar to me in the dream. One of the women has a blond braid and the other has longer dark hair. They sit down at a table and ask the bartender for this type of alcohol that you usually need one shot of and you\\u2019re good. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take the whole bottle.\\u201d The bartender is like, \\u201cNo you won\\u2019t.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, we will.\\u201d Josh is like, \\u201cYeah, let them have it. I\\u2019ll take care of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo! They\\u2019re going to be obnoxious and terrible.\\u201d But by the time I look back, the two women have finished the bottle and the bartender is standing there with shoulders shrugged. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no.\\u201d Of course they get crazy. Josh starts feeding off of them energetically because he doesn\\u2019t drink at all. I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cUh oh, this is not going to be good, you\\u2019re going from depressed to manic.\\u201d They\\u2019re playing on a piano. It is like a saloon. There\\u2019s nobody else in there. The bartender is like, \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re closing.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re closing? You just got these two ladies wasted and there\\u2019s no place for us to go. We\\u2019re staying here.\\u201d The dream shifts. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I\\u2019m at, maybe a Costco type area. There\\u2019s a guy, older man maybe in his fifties, pot-bellied white dude with short hair. He\\u2019s used his body his whole life to work, you can tell, his hands are super callused. He\\u2019s hungry and he\\u2019s trying to figure out what to eat that is healthy. I\\u2019m standing looking at everything in the freezer section and am like, \\u201cOkay, if you eat this, this and this, it doesn\\u2019t have any dairy.\\u201d I was trying to find food that met the restrictions he had. I say, \\u201cThis pizza has a cauliflower crust and it\\u2019s non-dairy with fake cheese. It comes with these other items in the box, so you can buy the whole thing and that\\u2019s your meal.\\u201d There\\u2019s a microwave conveniently nearby. He heats it up and eats while we\\u2019re standing in the freezer section. He puts the tray down on his shopping cart, eats and enjoys it. The whole time he\\u2019s complaining about how expensive it is for him to eat this way even though he needs to because it\\u2019s becoming life or death. He needs to start eating in a more healthy way. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cYou can complain about the money it costs to buy this food or you can complain about the money it costs for all the healthcare you\\u2019re going to need. There are ways to cut down because you can buy food at the beginning of the week and meal prep and that saves money. You have containers in the fridge you can eat.\\u201d I\\u2019m going through all this stuff I know from my nutrition degree to help him out and simplify things for him. But I don\\u2019t know who he is and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this for him. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m getting paid for it or not. It seems like a lot of energy being put into this person who keeps saying over and over again, \\u201cThis is really expensive.\\u201d Eventually I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDo you feel better?\\u201d He says yes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s your choice. You can keep eating shit and keep feeling like shit or you can figure out how to do this. He doesn\\u2019t give me a response and I just wake up.\"],[\"This was kind of a weird dream. I\\u2019m looking for a house to buy. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m with my ex and the kids or some other family. I just know I\\u2019m with other people and we\\u2019re all looking at houses together. There\\u2019s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you\\u2019d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They\\u2019re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu\\u2019u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I\\u2019m looking and we decide not to buy it because it\\u2019s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I\\u2019m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They\\u2019ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren\\u2019t white anymore. They\\u2019ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m not comfortable with them. I\\u2019m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I\\u2019m not sure who it is; it\\u2019s a female person and we\\u2019re not really friends. It\\u2019s kind of like I\\u2019m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it\\u2019s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We\\u2019re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I\\u2019m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn\\u2019t feel a connection either, so she\\u2019s just gone. As I leave, I\\u2019m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I\\u2019m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn\\u2019t really resonance there anyway. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it\\u2019s just not for me.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Aila and her two kids. I\\u2019m not sure if my kids are around. We\\u2019re in her house and her house is gigantic because she hosts people in it. She hosts retreats in this house. The house has huge rooms and huge levels. Each level has its own set of dishes. We\\u2019re looking at all the dishes and cleaning them. One room was used and there\\u2019s a ton of dishes in the sink that need to be cleaned and put away. In another room I\\u2019m putting away props or items that had been used. There is a retreat going on, but maybe it\\u2019s not really a retreat because they seem to be friends of hers. I recognize all of them because I know a lot of her friends. They\\u2019re just here to hang out. One of the friends is setting up a tent in the yard under a bunch of trees with her daughter. Aila calls her over. Everyone starts talking for a little bit, but I don\\u2019t remember any particular conversation or how long that interaction lasted. There was a busyness with a lot of friends unpacking or doing other things. I\\u2019m in one of the rooms now with Aila and her kids. We\\u2019re cleaning up dishes. I also have this plant in my hand. I\\u2019m not sure where I got it. It has orange grasses but it doesn\\u2019t have a pot, so I'm trying to find a pot for it. One of the kiddos is cleaning this interesting bowl like a big gravy boat. All the dishes in the house are the exact same, just different shades of blue, turquoise, teal. One of the kids is cleaning this one that looks kind of like a round gravy boat. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019ll take that, it\\u2019s perfect for this plant.\\u201d I put the plant in it. Somehow I get this other plant that kind of looks like a lei. I put it over the other plant in the dish and it\\u2019s actually really pretty with the orange underneath and the one that looks like a lei with flowers. I don\\u2019t recognize the flowers and in fact, neither of these plants are like ones that I\\u2019ve seen ever in my whole existence alive on earth. Aila comes and looks. I think it upsets her because I'm smooshing the plant underneath. But I\\u2019m not sure if she\\u2019s upset but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cMaybe let\\u2019s move that to another place.\\u201d She\\u2019s very diplomatic in the way she says it. There\\u2019s more but I can\\u2019t recall.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There\\u2019s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She\\u2019s cooking. I\\u2019m trying to load the dishwasher. It\\u2019s a very complicated dishwasher and I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in. She\\u2019s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There\\u2019s enough though. I\\u2019m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever\\u2019s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, \\u201cCan you please open this?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy? I don\\u2019t drink.\\u201d Even though it\\u2019s beer, it\\u2019s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are you all drinking?\\u201d We\\u2019re at a gathering, maybe it\\u2019s Christmas or New Year\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t know, but there\\u2019s a celebration happening. Of course, it\\u2019s my family, so they\\u2019re all drinking and I\\u2019m the only one that doesn\\u2019t drink. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy am I opening this bottle for her?\\u201d I think she\\u2019s trying to give it to me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, here\\u2019s your bottle of beer-wine.\\u201d I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I\\u2019m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird\\u2019s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn\\u2019t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s not my childhood home or even my home. I think it\\u2019s my mom\\u2019s home. I\\u2019m there to see her. I think I\\u2019m my current age. I\\u2019m sitting in the corner of the kitchen where the cabinets come together. I\\u2019m sitting on the floor. She\\u2019s yelling at me. My little brothers are there. They\\u2019re little again. My brother that was born right after me is also there, but he looks like he\\u2019s maybe just out of his teenage years. So maybe I\\u2019m in my early twenties. She\\u2019s yelling at me and my two youngest brothers. My other brother and I are going to take the kids on a trip. We\\u2019re going to the grocery store. We go to the grocery store in his white Tacoma truck (he doesn\\u2019t have one in real life). My brothers are in the car with us. We go to the grocery store and get all of our supplies. Then we go to check out and my brother decides the lines are too long for him and he\\u2019s pissed off. So he decides to take the cart full of groceries and somehow get them in the truck that\\u2019s now in the store. He drives the truck through these two doors. The regular sliding doors are not an option because there are a ton of people in there and a rent-a-cop. There are these two doors on the side which I don\\u2019t think a truck can fit through, but he drives through them anyways. The truck barely makes it through. He heads out into the parking lot which is full of people. I\\u2019m pissed at him like, \\u201cYou just fucking stole groceries! And you almost run over people. We need to go back.\\u201d He circles around the huge parking lot. He\\u2019s trying to park but we\\u2019re on a side of the building with an entire school\\u2019s worth of parents and kids. The kids are running around. This is where he decides to park. I\\u2019m getting more and more pissed because at any moment the cops are going to come and arrest us for stealing groceries even though I didn\\u2019t steal them. I\\u2019m also afraid he\\u2019s going to hit some of the kids running around this parking lot. The kids are kindergarten up through fifth or eighth grade. He parks in one stall that\\u2019s totally open with no one nearby. But then he decides he doesn\\u2019t like it, pulls out of it, and goes to find another spot to park. This stall is in between a minivan and SUV that have parked next to each other, but they haven\\u2019t parked straight, so the stall in between is not large enough for the truck. They parked so that no one could park near them because their kids are running around. But he picks that stall to park in. i\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?! You\\u2019re acting entitled. You\\u2019re not paying attention to other people and your surroundings. We need to pay for these groceries.\\u201d I finally get the groceries out of the truck and there are so many that I have to get two carts, so I put them head to head, which is kind of strange. He pushes them in, but he\\u2019s trying to go in the out doors. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to go over to the side where it says, In.\\u201d Because he was trying to go In the Out, there\\u2019s chaos with the amount of people at the checkout. We can\\u2019t actually make it in so we have to go in these other doors. We have to go around to get to the cash registers and pay. We\\u2019re on our way around and I\\u2019m pushing the cart. Somehow this guy with a baby on his back and holding the hand of a toddler, I manage to trip him. Really what happens is he wasn\\u2019t paying attention as I was trying to squeeze behind him. He turns and he trips. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh, are you okay?\\u201d He gets really upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. I should have made more noise so you could hear that I was behind you. Are you okay? Is the baby okay?\\u201d He stands up and starts to yell at me and my brother because in our hurry, we don\\u2019t have our masks on. This guy also doesn\\u2019t have his mask on because he\\u2019s pulled it down around his neck. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to have to cite you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope, hang on, don\\u2019t worry. I have my mask right here.\\u201d I pull my mask out to put it on and my brother pulls his mask out to put it on. I\\u2019m thinking this guy is going to be more upset about tripping and falling, but he\\u2019s more upset about the masks.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a train with my son and he\\u2019s maybe seven or eight in the dream. It\\u2019s nighttime. I have no idea where the train is going. I do know it\\u2019s going to stop at some point for an amusement park. It\\u2019s like a haunted house. Everyone can get off the train here and go to this haunted house if they want to. That\\u2019s what happens. It\\u2019s all people I don\\u2019t know except for this one guy who I know in the dream but not in real life. He\\u2019s a shorter white guy in his thirties. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re talking about but there\\u2019s an easy camaraderie between the two of us. He does have a girlfriend and she gives me the side-eye every once in a while which is weird because I\\u2019m not interested - I\\u2019m there with my son. We\\u2019re talking about the haunted house. I see a bunch of people go through it. I\\u2019m actually not sure if it\\u2019s haunted but there are things to do in this house. It\\u2019s an attraction of some sort. I go through it with my son and there are parts that freak me out but not too badly. It\\u2019s fun. The haunted house lets out onto this huge grassy field. It\\u2019s nighttime and the stars are crazy - you can see all of them. I have a low grade anxiety because I\\u2019m wanting my son to play and run around but I\\u2019m also not wanting him to get lost or stolen by a stranger. There are kids he wants to play with so I\\u2019m letting him play but I\\u2019m also like, \\u201cStay where I can see you please.\\u201d He does run off at one point. I start to panic because I can\\u2019t see him. But the guy I\\u2019ve been talking with is like, \\u201cHey don\\u2019t worry, he\\u2019s with me and some friends. He\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d I feel alright and I go to lie on the grass in this huge field. The train is parked on the tracks and you can see the entrance and exit of the haunted house and night sky. I find a group of friends to sit down with and it\\u2019s Shiena, Connie and some other friends from high school. I sit down with them and we look up at the night sky. I am looking at this patch and am like, \\u201cUh, that is moving, there\\u2019s something there. That is a UFO.\\u201d They\\u2019re looking at it with me and are like, \\u201cYup, totally.\\u201d Some of them don\\u2019t believe me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope, that\\u2019s a UFO. keep watching. It\\u2019s going to move.\\u201d It does and it\\u2019s really strange because what it looks like is a briefcase that\\u2019s been opened all the way up and the underside of it has been camouflage to look more like stars. I can see that it\\u2019s not stars and it\\u2019s moving and the stars are blurry and they don\\u2019t actually match the rest of the sky. I\\u2019m calling for my son now because I don\\u2019t know if this is safe and there\\u2019s a UFO. It starts to move enough that other people are like, \\u201cOh shit, that\\u2019s not just night sky and it\\u2019s kind of close.\\u201d The briefcase starts to close up so you can see the rest of the UFO ship. My son is with me and grabbing my hand and is like, \\u201cMom, mom, let\\u2019s go. He\\u2019s pulling me back into the haunted house. He gets ahead of me and I\\u2019m really panicked now because we\\u2019re all trying to get on the train. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cCome back!\\u201d I can feel the panic in my chest. I\\u2019m not freaked out about the UFO. I\\u2019m just worried about my son running off and being on this train without me and running into who knows what. That sense of panic and dread is starting to build. Then the dream switches. I\\u2019m on a short bus with a bunch of other younger girls. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m me or slightly younger. There\\u2019s a coach, but I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re coaching us on. I just know I want to pole dance. There\\u2019s another coach who is the singer-songwriter LP, who is probably the most adrogynous human being I\\u2019ve ever seen in my life. They are also my coach and maybe five feet tall so really short compared to me. The other coach is trying to get us to do drills. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay whatever, it\\u2019s practice, we\\u2019ll get our drills going.\\u201d Now we\\u2019ve gotten off the short bus but I don\\u2019t know where we drove to. We\\u2019re at a gymnasium. In the corner is something that looks like a playground on what looks like a sheet of plywood on wheels. The wheels can lock and unlock. There\\u2019s all this metal playground stuff and a pole connected to it on one side. I go to roll this out, but then I can\\u2019t get the wheels to lock. I keep going to the wrong side of the playground structure to do my pole exercises. At some point I realize I have all my rings on. I have to take my rings off and I put them on a side table that just shows up out of nowhere. All our stuff is there - our gym bags and such. I\\u2019ve got a zipper pouch that I put on the table. I leave my rings out though and I remember thinking that I should put them away so I don\\u2019t forget them. There\\u2019s another girl, someone who I grew up with in my neighborhood in Hawaii and I also went to school with her. I terrorized her and was so mean and cruel to her. I\\u2019m feeling super bad about how we used to treat her. She wants to do the pole stuff, too. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to take your rings off.\\u201d She also has her rings in a pile on this side table. The thing is, once I finally get the wheels locked after like five tries, I don\\u2019t have the strength for pole dancing. I can\\u2019t do an inversion, I can\\u2019t pull myself up, and neither can she. I also don\\u2019t have any grip, so my hands keep sliding on the pole. She keeps trying and I keep trying. Eventually I get really frustrated. The other girls on the team are doing something else, whatever team event they\\u2019re doing. A bunch of other people show up at this gym. I think it\\u2019s the football team and it\\u2019s time for their practice. We have to leave. I\\u2019m super dissatisfied because I didn\\u2019t get enough practice in. I try to roll the platform to the other side and out of the way so I can keep trying. But then I notice that the guys from this other team are watching me and it\\u2019s making me feel very uncomfortable because I feel like I\\u2019m being objectified. Now I really can\\u2019t do any tricks on the pole because I\\u2019m so uncomfortable from all of that.\"],[\"Ana and I are together with her son. We are on an adventure of some kind. We\\u2019re driving and we pull over because someone has to use the bathroom. We\\u2019re in the mountains and we find a rest stop. At the rest stop are a bunch of cattle and they\\u2019re all having babies. It\\u2019s funny because they aren\\u2019t standing up and birthing. They\\u2019ve dug holes and are dropping the babies into holes. Ana\\u2019s son is watching the whole thing and so am I. We are completely fascinated by all this birth happening all around us. The dream switches. Now I\\u2019m with my dad, siblings, and kids. We\\u2019re in a place that kind of reminds me of a Chinatown. We\\u2019re trying to find someplace to eat. We\\u2019re walking down the street and there are a lot of options. I think it\\u2019s during pandemic times because everyone has masks on and there are not a lot of places open. This part of the dream gets kind of fuzzy. I don\\u2019t know exactly what we\\u2019re going after. Funny things are happening at the restaurant when we go to order. I\\u2019m not hungry because there\\u2019s food I can\\u2019t eat. Then we find this other stand and the kitchen is gross with cockroaches everywhere and the smell of rancid oil. Then the dream switches. I am with a group of people. I only recognize one person and it\\u2019s my high school classmate. We\\u2019re a bunch of high schoolers. We\\u2019re at horse stables. There\\u2019s a European woman with an accent. She\\u2019s teaching us how to be around horses. First she does a demonstration in the arena. All of the horses are black. She\\u2019s riding the horse with no saddle, no bit, no reins. She\\u2019s showing us how to ride, basically dressage. She\\u2019s showing us and saying, \\u201cThis is very easy.\\u201d I\\u2019m talking to the group and am like, \\u201cNone of that is easy. I\\u2019ve done dressage and it\\u2019s not easy to get a horse to do perfect gaits and stop on perfect points, especially without a saddle and bit.\\u201d The woman comes out and says, \\u201cOkay, now it\\u2019s your turn.\\u201d Everyone files into the arena. At the far end is a stable with like twenty black horses. Everyone goes and gets a horse. I\\u2019m actually excited about being around the horses, but for some reason I don\\u2019t go out right away. All these classmates of mine have horses. They\\u2019re doing the hand motions that she\\u2019s showing them. There are a bunch of other trainers, men, who are keeping an eye on everyone. I\\u2019m horrified now because it\\u2019s so crowded and it\\u2019s so loud and there\\u2019s no way in hell any horse would stand there for all this noise, chaos and inexperienced people trying to get them to do things. I think the horses are put away and it\\u2019s time for us to stretch. We\\u2019re sitting in the dirt of the arena. They\\u2019re asking me how to stretch the pelvis. I\\u2019m showing them how to do a straddle and rock the pelvis forward. A man walks by and I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s our teacher or a trainer or a chaperone. He takes over from me and shows everyone how to do different stretches. Everyone follows along. Our low backs get stretched. I\\u2019m folded all the way over with my head resting on my legs and thinking, \\u201cWow, my low back has never been this flexible. Huh.\\u201d Then the dream switches again. I\\u2019m parked somewhere. I leave my car to go do something. When I come back, my ex-boyfriend is parked next to me. He\\u2019s parked crooked so I can\\u2019t open the passenger side door if I wanted to. In fact, I don\\u2019t know how he\\u2019s getting out of the car because he hasn\\u2019t left himself very much room. He gets out and he has all his stuff and he\\u2019s super happy to see me. I\\u2019m shocked and have no idea why he\\u2019s there. He walks around and puts his stuff in the back seat of my car and says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? Why are you here and what are we doing?\\u201d I have no idea how we\\u2019re suddenly here together in a parking lot in a tropical space. He says, \\u201cCome, I want to show you this island.\\u201d It\\u2019s an island where people have to boat out to live there. All the houses are gigantic. There\\u2019s an estuary that cuts the island in half so salt water flows from one end of the island to the other. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis island gets demolished by a hurricane.\\u201d It\\u2019s tropical. There\\u2019s a mix of super rich and super poor people. As we float down this center estuary I\\u2019m noticing huge houses and a huge building for a swap meet with secondhand stuff because everyone on the island reuses everything. I go into that building and look at all the items in the swap meet. I\\u2019m watching an old guy haggle for a tablecloth. The tablecloth has a stain on it and the woman who owns the place is like, \\u201cNo no, let me find you another one.\\u201d She goes off to find him another one. I\\u2019m wandering through and see a bunch of old Christmas decorations. I\\u2019m laughing and like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re on an island, who\\u2019s going to do anything with these? No one. Why are they all here? It\\u2019s junk.\\u201d I leave this area and decide to fly. My body is flying so I can see the rest of the island. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I can see green everywhere and tropical plants. It\\u2019s not a problem to fly. I\\u2019m watching people scaling cliffs and kayaking through the river. It\\u2019s paradise. The water is a beautiful crystal blue. I have no idea what happened to my ex-boyfriend, he disappeared from the dream at some point. Then at one point, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHuh, I don\\u2019t think I want to fly because I could crash land.\\u201d I remind myself that I won\\u2019t crash, though, and I\\u2019ll be fine. The dream ends with me flying over the whole island, taking it in and knowing it\\u2019s about to be wrecked by a hurricane.\"],[\"The setting is the restaurant where I worked in university. It\\u2019s a busy restaurant in a mall and they\\u2019ve changed our uniforms over again, which they used to do twice a year. Sometimes the shirts were horrible, but the bottoms were always black jeans. Only this time instead of just changing our shirts, we had to wear tights. I hated it. They showed everything - they were not even the good kind of yoga pants, they were like cheap knock offs that didn\\u2019t even hold their shape. Not only did they show everything, but they were baggy, too. I really didn\\u2019t want to wear them. I don\\u2019t know how I got away with it. I was still wearing my black jeans and other servers were starting to wear these tights. I had a whole bunch of stuff in my backpack and I put it in the office for safekeeping - not really sure why I did that, but we did have a problem with theft. Anyway, I had a bunch of my stuff in the office and they were stupid things, too - plastic knick knacks like McDonald\\u2019s toys and I had them in a plastic container, like tupperware. When I finished my shift, they were still there and I was trying to put them in my apron and there were too many of them and I was losing track. Then when I went to leave the restaurant at the end of my shift, the good owner (not the shyster one) and two of the other staff, we needed to fix something for someone\\u2019s car so that they could actually leave. And so we walked over to this other store in the mall to assist the staff member with communicating what it was that needed to be fixed. It was like a diode or something that needed to be replaced - it was this little tiny part in this series of bigger complicated parts. So we waited there with her while the part was being replaced. Oh my god, it just went on and on and on, and the person that was supposed to be fixing it kept talking to other people and chatting. And I\\u2019m like oh, I have to get out of here and why is this taking so long. And I just got really agitated and frustrated when we were there. Finally the store employee went over and flipped one switch and it recharged her diode and then we went out and we popped it under the hood of her car, and she was off. I said goodbye to the other two people and then I was walking across the parking lot with the remaining person (I know her in real life) and she was telling me that she knows she\\u2019s going to end up alone one day. And I was like: \\u201cReally? I\\u2019m shocked!\\u201d (because in real life she has a husband and two kids and they\\u2019re a beautiful family unit). And she said: \\u201cYep, my husband is either all in or all out, and I\\u2019ve just always known that one day he\\u2019s going to be gone.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be okay with that?\\u201d And she said she is. And then I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand how people can just shut off their emotions like that.\\u201d I told her about what it felt like when Omar died and said it was (and I did the math in my head in my dreams)...I said I was 28, so that was 30, no 22 years ago, and I still think about him every day. He\\u2019s never gone out of my heart, and I just don\\u2019t understand loving somebody and then just not loving them. When you love someone, they\\u2019re always a part of you. And then of course, I woke up because the emotion from that is still really strong.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Grid\\u201d In my dream last night, I\\u2019m a time traveler. The framework of the dream is set up on a grid system. I have lived in Toronto, Ontario, but I don\\u2019t live there now (for a short period of time I was there) and it\\u2019s a very easy city to get to know if you spend some time on the grid, which is a north-south-east-west system. In the dream, if you stop at a washroom or go down into the subway, you end up in a different time zone when you come out. So the whole dream is me trying to gather people together so that we\\u2019re all going into these wormholes at the same time so we don\\u2019t lose each other. The interesting thing is I keep waking up out of this dream and then going back to sleep and simply picking up where it left off. But every time I go back to sleep. I\\u2019m trying to regather the people that I was with before I woke up. The dream starts and I\\u2019m with my own family and one of the places in the grid is a restaurant, but it\\u2019s one of the older kinds of restaurants where the upstairs also has sleeping rooms for travelers. Not all of the people in that time zone are good people, so I\\u2019m warning my daughter to stay away from one of these girls because I can just tell by the look of her that she\\u2019s a thief and a prostitute. She\\u2019s sizing us up and I know if we don\\u2019t keep our money and valuables safe, she will steal from us. I\\u2019m trying to get the door of the restaurant locked because the prostitute has gone off with Omar and I don\\u2019t want her to come back in because I don\\u2019t want her to follow us through the next wormhole. So I do manage to keep the door locked and the prostitute comes out an hour later from the doorway and she has only her underwear on and her bra and she\\u2019s saying she\\u2019s desperately trying to get in and I know this is part of the trick because I can tell by her face that she\\u2019s not really upset. And I just know this. I do manage to succeed in convincing them to keep the door locked. Then I see her coming out of a different doorway about five minutes later. She gets up and she\\u2019s fully dressed and I can see in her hand that she has two different wallets, so she managed to get them from someone else, but not us. So this is going to sound funny, but it\\u2019s winter in the dream on the grid, and I\\u2019ve got my kids\\u2019 things to carry plus some supplies - food and an extra change of clothes. And my daughter is pushing me around in a shopping cart - she keeps telling me to get in with my stuff and it\\u2019s hard to push it because it\\u2019s a shopping cart and the snow keeps building up on the wheels. So we\\u2019re putting the heavy things in there and I\\u2019m having a hard time pushing it and my daughter keeps wanting me to get in there and rest, and she is pushing me around so we look like homeless people. We go into this other portal and come out on the other side and it\\u2019s a party. It\\u2019s packed with people and there are people that I know. So, one of these couples that I know are people that I know from the Sail Club, and I realize that the man is screwing around on the woman and I think, \\u201cOh no, that\\u2019s horrible!\\u201d And I wrestle with the idea of telling her. And I don\\u2019t yet because it\\u2019s a really tough decision to make and is it any of my business, and what effects of that decision will it have on others. So while I\\u2019m wrestling with that decision, I realize that she is actually aware of it and just doesn\\u2019t appear to either care or acknowledge it, so I don\\u2019t tell her. In the same scene, there\\u2019s another little girl and she\\u2019s being shadowed by a teenage girl. So the first girl is 8 and the other is maybe 16. They go into the showers and I\\u2019m standing there because I\\u2019m on this other girl because of the shadowing. So they both get into the same shower and I\\u2019m thinking this isn\\u2019t right. And then I walk in and look and they are showering together and they are undressed. I step in and open the door and I ask the younger girl, \\u201cAre you alright?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t answer me. So I glare at the other one and fierce her down and take the younger girl and put some clothes on her because her clothes have disappeared, so I\\u2019m just taking some various things and covering her up with them. I say, \\u201cIs this yours? Is this yours?\\u201d and people say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not mine,\\u201d and so I put a various eclectic wardrobe on her. And then I\\u2019m wandering around the party with her in my hand asking anyone if they know who this girl is because she doesn\\u2019t talk. People will say, \\u201cOh, I saw her with so and so,\\u201d and then the so and so won\\u2019t be there and there\\u2019s different so and so\\u2019s every time and I can\\u2019t find who this girl belongs to. But then I\\u2019m starting to get concerned that I\\u2019m getting sucked into or overly involved with the dynamics of the people at this party and I\\u2019m afraid that I will forget that I\\u2019m a time traveler and that I\\u2019ll lose my time traveler family, so I start to gather up the people that I came with - my daughter, some other nameless people who are just there, they are part of my travel group - and I\\u2019m looking for someone now. I say I need someone to take care of her for me, and this couple - the oblivious woman and the man who is screwing around on her all the time - say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take her. We\\u2019ll love her. We love everybody.\\u201d In the dream I\\u2019m not concerned that she\\u2019ll be sexually abused. I know that they are going to take care of her. They\\u2019re good people, they just have this other weird cake. And so I leave her with them and get back into the shopping cart outside of the door and we go down and I\\u2019m starting to recognize streets. I\\u2019m starting to look a lot more closely at the grid because I want to plan where we\\u2019re going and not just go into any door and be more conscious of the grid. I\\u2019m starting to feel more textures in the dream. So as I climb back in the cart, I\\u2019m feeling that the front handle of it is actually cold and it\\u2019s plastic feeling and the metal of the cart is even colder and I\\u2019m trying to pull the sleeve of my coat down over my hand so it won\\u2019t stick to it. It\\u2019s actually not that comfortable riding in it because the wheels keep getting stuck and it\\u2019s bumpy. But this is what she wants to do and I let her. We have some conversations. She\\u2019s still bothered by locking the prostitute out of the first scene, and I tell her that regardless of what we did she would still steal everyone\\u2019s wallets and she would still make the same choices and it\\u2019s not our purpose to try and change people\\u2019s choices here, but to learn the grid and to find our way through it. So I\\u2019m starting to read the signs and I\\u2019m recognizing where we are - what starts to become a sense of direction in the grid. My daughter keeps steering the cart. Now I don\\u2019t know where my consciousness goes during this - maybe I go to sleep in the dream and I wake up. Instead of staying on the grid we\\u2019ve gone off to side grid things and we\\u2019re in smaller parts because she likes them better because they are closer together and more intimate, but they don\\u2019t have any identifying characteristics. So it\\u2019s a lot harder for me to find the main patterns of the grid when she does this, but we do. So the second time I dive in and dive out, it\\u2019s me finding our way out of this non-identifiable part onto more of the main grid. And then we come to a wormhole that I know we\\u2019re supposed to go into and I don\\u2019t want to go in, so I linger outside of it. Now it\\u2019s just my daughter and I. Because she went off the grid, we lost the other people we were supposed to be traveling with. I\\u2019m hoping that by staying on the grid, we\\u2019ll find them the next time we pop up somewhere. I also think that maybe if we wait, they might pop up out of this wormhole because I think they\\u2019re going to be looking for us. So while we\\u2019re waiting around this one crossroads, I talk or make a connection with an older man. At first he\\u2019s just an older man. We just have a conversation about some kind of philosophy or something. I\\u2019m not really paying much attention to the conversation. Then we decide to go down into the wormhole and we do, and we\\u2019re staying together and I\\u2019m giving her instructions, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta make sure we don\\u2019t get separated. Don\\u2019t go off onto any areas without telling me.\\u201d We pop up successfully and I see the rest of the people that we\\u2019re supposed to be with and we rush and we connect back with them. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember exactly what they said, but they\\u2019re telling us what happened during their wormhole experience. The interesting thing about this as the dream is starting to come to a close is that together we find the next wormhole that we\\u2019re supposed to dive into, but people keep needing to go to the washroom. But I\\u2019m telling them they can\\u2019t do this because each washroom is a wormhole and we\\u2019re supposed to stay together. Some of them decide to do it anyway and I know that here we go again, we\\u2019re going to get sidetracked from our purpose. Well, we keep trying to find each other. And then I see this old man again and he\\u2019s standing up - he\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am. Now as I start talking to him I\\u2019m not just seeing him for what his profession is with small talk, but I start to feel beyond the surface of his skin into the character and kind of being he is, and he\\u2019s just so beautiful on the inside. My being feels his being. I tell him that once I go down into the wormhole, I won\\u2019t ever see him again. And he says, \\u201cyes, I know.\\u201d And then we just start to hug, but it\\u2019s the kind of hug where you just kind of fall into the other person - it\\u2019s not a squeezy hug, it\\u2019s just so enveloping and I just stand there. It seems like five minutes go by and I\\u2019m so comforted by this hug. And I realize as we\\u2019re doing this that we also need to not get so preoccupied with staying on the grid, that we\\u2019re missing the connections with the people that are in between wormholes. And then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cake\\u201d I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I tell him that sure, I\\u2019ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn\\u2019t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it\\u2019s run by a temperamental chef. There\\u2019s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I\\u2019m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they\\u2019re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they\\u2019re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they\\u2019re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I\\u2019m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I\\u2019m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there\\u2019s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there\\u2019s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover\\u2019s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She\\u2019s about 10. And she\\u2019s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn\\u2019t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she\\u2019s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn\\u2019t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn\\u2019t upset about it. He\\u2019s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he\\u2019s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn\\u2019t address the cake. Now we\\u2019re in a car and we\\u2019re driving up this beautiful roadway - it\\u2019s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there\\u2019s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in when you\\u2019re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It\\u2019s a perfect day and there\\u2019s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it\\u2019s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cPhotographs\\u201d The setting is somewhere I\\u2019ve never been before. I don\\u2019t recognize it. The population is a higher density than I\\u2019ve lived anywhere in Canada. I\\u2019ve never lived anywhere else other than here, so I'm not sure. The architecture I\\u2019m positive is much older than contemporary. It\\u2019s not made of stone though, so it\\u2019s not Medieval, it\\u2019s not Renaissance. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Northern European either. I\\u2019m feeling it\\u2019s more Mediterranean or something closer to the Equator, though it\\u2019s not as hot climate wise. It\\u2019s very colorful. There\\u2019s a lot of curves to the architecture and extra pieces added on, too, and it\\u2019s not just a box structure. There\\u2019s artistic pieces added on so it looks pleasing to the eye. It\\u2019s very artsy in this community. People make everything by hand. There\\u2019s a lot of thought put into it first. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be hierarchy of economy either or social standing. So what you eat, what you wear and your craft are all socially equal. So when you go to have food, you pick each item from the person who has created it. Then you create your food together. You can also go to a cook who is making food for others. You don\\u2019t just go in there, order at a counter and buy it. You have a conversation and then the cook shares a dish with you that he/she/they think you would like. So it\\u2019s quite different and very beautiful. I am a representative of life. In my dream I\\u2019m not called a photographer. I don\\u2019t actually have a camera. I have something that takes shadows so it\\u2019s a light. There\\u2019s a background and then once the light is shined on the object or person, it\\u2019s the outline that represents who they are. I make these for people. So they\\u2019ll come in and have a conversation with me and when I think it\\u2019s time, I\\u2019ll shine the light (with their permission, that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re there for, it\\u2019s not uninvited) and create a shadow for them. Lots of times this is done in exchange for foods or other gifts. This is a barter system economy. I\\u2019m very happy there. The dream comes to a conclusion in two ways. There seems to be a theme in my dreams lately where they\\u2019re both/and. Things are happening at the same time. So at the same time as I am creating a shadow piece for myself, I am also in the place where the person who cooks for other people is cooking. I\\u2019m in there just sitting. I\\u2019m actually studying some of my own work. The cook is androgynous. That seems to be another theme. I\\u2019m talking to them just in little bits. It\\u2019s a very comfortable conversation - the way you would have a conversation with someone you lived with for a long period of time where you say a couple of sentences and they respond and you\\u2019re both kind of doing your own thing. Fifteen minutes go by and then you make another couple remarks. It\\u2019s like that. So I\\u2019m in there and I\\u2019m aware that there\\u2019s a man that comes in. He\\u2019s trying to order a sandwich the way we would here now. The cook is not responding to him. So I\\u2019m aware that this exchange is unsuccessfully occuring in the sidelines of my consciousness. It gets to a point where I\\u2019m uncomfortable continuing to do what I\\u2019m doing there because this is disruptive. I\\u2019m aware that the cook is agitated. I\\u2019m aware also that the man is not going to go away. I feel compassion and want to stand in to alleviate the discomfort. So I go behind where the food is prepared. I start talking to the cook in the way I would talk to the cook before I was offered something to eat, hoping that by modeling the behavior, the man is going to understand. He doesn\\u2019t. Instead he thinks that I\\u2019m another employee. He starts trying to get me to make the sandwich. I don\\u2019t. But the cook responds to me and gives me a couple slices of tomato. So I go get a plate and put the tomato slices on a plate and bring it over to where I had been doing my own work. He looks puzzled at first and then a little bit angry. I assume that he\\u2019s been thinking, \\u201cWow, I\\u2019ve been standing here asking for something for x number of minutes, and she just walks in there and starts helping herself and gets service.\\u201d And then he reaches over as though he\\u2019s going to help himself, and then someone else materializes on the scene and grabs his arm and removes it. There\\u2019s a commotion. The man is eventually removed because he won\\u2019t listen and he won\\u2019t start trying to force a sandwich because none is appearing. I realize that I\\u2019m describing this, my consciousness is flipping back and forth from this scene through the portal of my work that I\\u2019m trying to focus on. In my own work, I am adjusting my own posture so I can get the line of the shadow that I want through this piece. The piece is created by wearing a sarong just between your navel and your hips. It\\u2019s not a flowy sarong, it\\u2019s more like the ones you see in Egyptian photos where the material is thicker and the piece that hangs over the front is wide - it\\u2019s not flowy, it\\u2019s made of a stiffer fabric. On the top fabric goes around the ribcage up to the nipples, so they start at the bottom rib - the material is stiffer - and they go up towards the nipples. What keeps happening is every time I adjust this piece of fabric over my own body, it goes over top of my nipples and I\\u2019m trying to get it to say just below the line of the nipples so you see the actual line of the nipples in the outline and then it goes down the rest of the body. Also in my dream, my physical body is getting really turned on by this. Every time it happens in my dream, I find it hard to stay in the dream. So the moment I get this right. There it is! The shadow is exactly the way I want it to look and feel, it\\u2019s just like Boom! My whole body is electrified. That\\u2019s the end of the dream. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cash\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town and I\\u2019m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They\\u2019re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I\\u2019m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it\\u2019s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there\\u2019s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they\\u2019re not making any sound, so I\\u2019m suspecting that it\\u2019s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don\\u2019t have that much money yet. I\\u2019m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don\\u2019t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I\\u2019m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I\\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table. They\\u2019ve wandered off now and I\\u2019m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I\\u2019m sensing another presence there that I can\\u2019t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what\\u2019s wrong with my car. He\\u2019s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic\\u2019s and I tell them exactly what\\u2019s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don\\u2019t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I\\u2019ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, \\u201cYay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.\\u201d And they\\u2019re saying, \\u201cOh wow, that\\u2019s fantastic.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn\\u2019t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.\\u201d So I\\u2019m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I\\u2019m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar\\u2019s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he\\u2019s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I\\u2019ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, \\u201cOh, what was wrong with it?\\u201d And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I\\u2019m cautious as Mike asks me what\\u2019s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, \\u201cOh? How did you know to say that?\\u201d because he knows even though I\\u2019m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don\\u2019t know the exact language to call the parts. And he\\u2019s looking at me. And I\\u2019m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I\\u2019m thinking is that I don\\u2019t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he\\u2019s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we\\u2019re in shifts and changes and we\\u2019re sitting in his mom\\u2019s actual house on the couch in the living room. There\\u2019s a picture of Omar on the end table. I\\u2019ve got my one arm around the back of Mike\\u2019s shoulders soothing him. I\\u2019m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, \\u201cOmar told you, didn\\u2019t he?\\u201d and I said, \\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d And then I say to him: \\u201care you okay?\\u201d And he puts his head down and it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom\\u2019s house are gone. We\\u2019re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we\\u2019re in it. Omar\\u2019s at the wheel and he\\u2019s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He\\u2019s tapping the gas pedal and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201chmm well this is good.\\u201d I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, \\u201cyeah and look how much cash I\\u2019ve got left over.\\u201d He laughs. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that extra cash?\\u201d And I know what I\\u2019m going to do with it, but I haven\\u2019t told anyone. So we\\u2019re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it\\u2019s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we\\u2019re driving down Colburn for a block and now it\\u2019s the year it would be now. I\\u2019m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an ice cream store over there. That\\u2019s new. There\\u2019s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there\\u2019s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn\\u2019t changed.\\u201d Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing? Now we\\u2019re back on Kent St.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.\\u201d He looks at me and we\\u2019re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I\\u2019ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing here?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I\\u2019ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.\\u201d I give it to him and I say, \\u201cGo buy a guitar. Just do it!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d So we go into the store and we\\u2019re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, \\u201cOh what one are you interested in?\\u201d Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, \\u201cWell, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn\\u2019t have the pickup and it\\u2019s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.\\u201d So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.\\u201d (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYes!\\u201d And he says, \\u201cDone!\\u201d So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they\\u2019re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that\\u2019s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there\\u2019s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There\\u2019s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There\\u2019s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it\\u2019s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he\\u2019s doing. It looks like he\\u2019s making chocolate chip cookies. He\\u2019s got the dough rolled out and there\\u2019s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, \\u201cWhat the hell?!\\u201d I walk up and I\\u2019m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they\\u2019re not even chocolate chips. They\\u2019re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I\\u2019m thinking, oh my god, that\\u2019s gross, but I\\u2019m fascinated that he\\u2019s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: \\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\\u201d and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they\\u2019ve already gone out of that room and I know they\\u2019re going down a hall and there\\u2019s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There\\u2019s no tools in front of him and no table. He\\u2019s faking working. I realize that he\\u2019s eavesdropping, he\\u2019s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my dream?! You\\u2019ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.\\u201d He starts telling me that he\\u2019s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It\\u2019s bullshit what he\\u2019s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don\\u2019t want to lose them and I certainly don\\u2019t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it\\u2019s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He\\u2019s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like \\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, \\u201cThis is Errant, my ex-husband.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cThis is Omar.\\u201d As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar\\u2019s hand, I realize that there\\u2019s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant\\u2019s going to be mad about this and he\\u2019s going to pound it out into me because he\\u2019s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I\\u2019m like I can\\u2019t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don\\u2019t want that handshake to join. Errant says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad,\\u201d as though he knows Omar\\u2019s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, \\u201cFor fucks sake! He knows that and he\\u2019s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He\\u2019s inserting himself here and of course, Omar\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh thanks very much.\\u201d He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, \\u201cOh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.\\u201d I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I\\u2019m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there\\u2019s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I\\u2019m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he\\u2019s a jerk, don\\u2019t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I\\u2019m still so agitated I can\\u2019t calm myself down in the dream. I\\u2019m feeling both threatened that Errant\\u2019s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I\\u2019m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I\\u2019m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won\\u2019t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I\\u2019m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.\"],[\"\\u201cTea\\u201d I was in a greenhouse. I was planting and growing things that I would eat. There\\u2019s other people there doing the same thing, but they\\u2019re \\u201cgreenhouse mates\\u201d - we\\u2019re not friends, they\\u2019re just there and we\\u2019re part of the greenhouse community. I occasionally speak to them. I ask them if they\\u2019ve ever tried growing this. One of them will comment that yes they have with success, or no they haven\\u2019t ever tried that, or they tried it without success. I\\u2019m growing an amazingly different number of lettuces and cabbages which look distinctly different from each other. I\\u2019ve never seen any other than two strains of cabbage in my waking life. But there\\u2019s all kinds of cabbage, some of it is beyond frilly to the point of being downright hairy, but they\\u2019re not hairs, they\\u2019re actually long and skinny cabbage fibers that grow from the head of the cabbage and you would cut off and eat. This appears to be one of my favorite ones because I\\u2019m growing a lot of it. In waking life I don\\u2019t eat wheat or gluten. So I\\u2019m growing this gluten free bread. You put the seeds in a bowl and it rises and turns into a bread, but it\\u2019s really made of vegetable fibers. So in the dream, there\\u2019s lots of me growing food and it\\u2019s a nice dream. Inside the greenhouse there\\u2019s the right amount of moisture. It\\u2019s a bit messy, but it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s hydroponics and actual seeds and dirt. Then as I begin to harvest some of the seeds I\\u2019ve been growing and put them in containers and compartments, the dream deconstructs into a townhouse that I actually used to live in, in a place called Wellington Square. I\\u2019m making tea. So I\\u2019m making it out of the things I\\u2019ve grown. I\\u2019m making apple tea out of apple leaves and actual apples. I pour it into the pot and the water is just the right temperature. I wait and let it steep. I remember it tasted really good, too. There was cinnamon in it. Then I decide to get out my grandmother\\u2019s fine china tea sets. I pour from the pot into the tea cups and sit for a minute and think, \\u201cWhy haven\\u2019t I used these before? Tea really does taste better in it.\\u201d I\\u2019m sitting sipping my tea and I realize that it was my uncle\\u2019s birthday the next day and I invite him. This is the end of January in my dream. My logical mind says to me, this isn\\u2019t his actual birthday because it\\u2019s not. I\\u2019ve never had a dream where my uncle was in it. He\\u2019s my biological mother\\u2019s brother. He\\u2019s not mean or anything, but he\\u2019s not a super nice person. He\\u2019s childish and selfish like she is, but I decide to invite him over for his birthday and I make this cake out of my gluten free flour that I\\u2019ve grown in the greenhouse. I ice it and make the apple tea. It\\u2019s ready in the pot with my grandmother\\u2019s tea cups. When he comes to the door, he\\u2019s got these two other people with him - they\\u2019re both male - he hasn\\u2019t asked if he could invite them, he\\u2019s never been to my house before, we aren\\u2019t that close and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve got a lot of nerve just showing up with two extra people.\\u201d However, I give them tea and cake and invite them to sit down. They eat their cake. They comment that it\\u2019s good, but what\\u2019s it made of, we\\u2019ve never had cake like this before. So I tell them that it\\u2019s gluten free and from the greenhouse. Then they comment on the tea in the teacups and say they would rather have it out of a mug. And they drink their tea and ask me to make more but they want it in a mug. So I collect their teacups from them and I say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s time for you to go.\\u201d So they leave with me coaxing them: \\u201cTime to go. Out you go. Here\\u2019s your coat. Here\\u2019s your boots.\\u201d I open the door. They\\u2019re kind of looking at me oddly, but they leave and I close the door behind them. And that\\u2019s it. Then there\\u2019s another person in my house. I invited her and it\\u2019s Janet and her boyfriend. Her phone starts ringing and she ignores it because she\\u2019s in my living room having tea and talking. So I put it in her purse and close the zipper because now there\\u2019s dirty dishes and teacups lying around and I don\\u2019t want anything to spill on her phone. Everybody else finishes their tea. My Uncle comes into the kitchen and he starts talking to me. He tells me that he\\u2019s not happy with the business that he has and since he\\u2019s only in his late fifties that he\\u2019s going to explore other options for a career. One of the things that he\\u2019d like to do is to work in a greenhouse. I\\u2019m thinking, well that\\u2019s interesting. I say to him, \\u201cAre you serious? You\\u2019re only in your late fifties.\\u201d I\\u2019m in a bit of a shock that he\\u2019s saying this to me because I know it\\u2019s a lie - I know that he\\u2019s a lot older than that and I think, \\u201cYou know, you\\u2019ve never shown any interest in greenhouses. Why are you telling me this?\\u201d So I\\u2019m suspicious of his conversation, though I\\u2019m also appreciative that he\\u2019s choosing to do something he would enjoy instead of something that he doesn\\u2019t like. And then he tells me that he\\u2019ll see me next year at the same time on his birthday. And I say, \\u201cYup, just like every other year when I\\u2019ve always made you something.\\u201d He looks at me with surprise as though he doesn\\u2019t remember that I have every year invited him over and made him a cake and offered him tea. Then he does leave. Janet and her boyfriend come into the kitchen. She notices that her phone is not where she left it. I tell her I put it in her purse. They leave and then I wash all the dishes and put away my grandmother\\u2019s teacups. I\\u2019m thinking of them fondly and put them back in the cupboard.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Trek\\u201d The setting is in a way that it\\u2019s not the orderly kind of linear almost based on Roman architecture grid for cities that we have now - it\\u2019s not like that, it\\u2019s much different. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Agrarian either. I get the feeling that it\\u2019s again post-apocalyptic, but much further along in the future than the dream when I was standing in a burnt world and started choking and woke up because I was choking. Everyone here, we are wearing ragged bits of eclectic pieces of clothing. There\\u2019s no real recognizable city structure. There\\u2019s ruined buildings with grass and vegetation growing up, in, around the building. People have settled there and built structures out of other scraps and things. It\\u2019s not unpleasant to look at. It has a settled, organized, civilized feel to it. However, there\\u2019s agrimony between groups of people who have settled around these places. Part of the group that I am settling with, we know we have to flee or we\\u2019re probably going to be killed. So we organize very quickly. We can\\u2019t bring all of our stuff. Our stuff is an eclectic variety of things that we use to feed ourselves and clothe ourselves with. Some people have backpacks and these are being dispersed among the group. I\\u2019d say there\\u2019s probably about 60 or 75 in my group, but for the purpose of traveling and feeding ourselves, we organize ourselves into four groups, so there\\u2019s about twelve to fifteen in each group. They are dividing people into groups by skill level, so if you have already shown some survival skill behavior, they don\\u2019t put all of those people in one group. They\\u2019re separating them so there\\u2019s at least one person who\\u2019s got some know-how in each group. I\\u2019m one of those people who has some survival skills. I\\u2019m separated from some of my closer friends because we can\\u2019t all travel together and this makes me sad. We also have people in the group who have babies. There\\u2019s one woman who\\u2019s carrying a baby. They also divide these people up because they drag people down. They can\\u2019t hunt and some of them don\\u2019t have survival skills - they feel more dependent. We also have got two toddlers in our group and they\\u2019re not even clothed. They\\u2019re running around naked and we\\u2019re trying to find small backpacks they can carry and some clothes that will fit them. They were dividing toddlers up and they\\u2019re not even with their parents - I have a feeling that they don\\u2019t have parents. They are just random toddlers, so they\\u2019re divided up into groups. So we leave separately. All this organizing and scavenging for equipment that we can carry on our backs is done before nightfall. We leave undercover of the dark. We know we cannot follow each other when we\\u2019re traveling in all these different groups because that will reduce the chances that we\\u2019ll survive. We need to be in smaller groups, so we won\\u2019t be spotted. Much of the dream is climbing over landscapes - meadows and cliffs and forests and swampy muddy things where we get completely filthy, but then find a body of water to wash in. There\\u2019s some skirmishes within the group where people are hungry and stealing each other\\u2019s food, including the toddlers. I have to take extra food away from kids - you know how kids will just randomly run around and graze, they\\u2019ll just shove food in their mouths as they\\u2019re going - I can\\u2019t let them do that. I have to keep them on the rations. So this is one dream memory of me opening up the toddlers hands and opening them up because they\\u2019ve got three times more of the berries than they\\u2019re supposed to have and I have to disperse these around. Part of me, as I\\u2019m doing this, feels regret because the child is so innocent - it\\u2019s a natural thing for a child to do and I feel a little sadness. I also feel a little bit of inner frustration that I even have a toddler that I have to do this with when we\\u2019re trying so hard to survive. So it\\u2019s an honest mixture of feelings that I have when I\\u2019m doing this. As we climb over more complicated and go through more dense flora and fauna, there\\u2019s a part where I\\u2019m aware that the group that is pursuing us and trying to kill us is actually on our trail. I realize they\\u2019re getting closer. I see this because I\\u2019ve climbed up high. There's an alarm in the middle of the night. I have to wake everybody up and get them to move. Some of them don\\u2019t want to and I\\u2019m like, pack your backpack! And some people don\\u2019t want to carry it, and I\\u2019m like if you don\\u2019t get up and move we\\u2019re going to have to leave you here! So I end up carrying three more packs than I\\u2019m supposed to. I end up getting everybody up, but there\\u2019s a couple of people that were groggy and wouldn\\u2019t wake up, they may be with the group, but I\\u2019m not sure and we have to move. Then we are in like the Amazon forest and we rappel up. We make it all the way up. It\\u2019s hard. We\\u2019re carrying toddlers in packs, passing things out, and we make it up to the top. We are safe now from that group. The landscape is still pretty densely forested. As we realize we\\u2019re safe, we\\u2019re able to spread out and rest a little bit. It was pretty onerous getting up there like that and so has the whole journey. So we take a couple days to rest. As I\\u2019m doing this and we\\u2019re setting up a makeshift camp, I realize that one of the other groups is close by and doing a similar thing. I sneak through the underbrush and I was about to make contact and ask the leader if they think it\\u2019s safe to join up just for the rest part, I see that my ex best friend is in that group, and now I don\\u2019t want to. I don\\u2019t want to have any communication with her. I\\u2019m glad she\\u2019s out of my life. She\\u2019s really hurt me and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re no longer friends. I don\\u2019t want her back in. She\\u2019s also narcissistic and I feel much better now that she\\u2019s out of my life. But there\\u2019s also some sadness with it too - when someone you love and care about betrays you, there\\u2019s also some sadness. So I feel this emotion going through my body. By this time, the other leader is aware of our group. Some of the members of their group have spread out far enough so everyone knows that we\\u2019re both here. So I end up having to suck it up as we get together with this other group for a meal. There\\u2019s people in that group who were friends of mine from before we had to leave our home, so I\\u2019m having this pleasant conversation with them. It\\u2019s a feeling of camaraderie. I\\u2019m aware that my friend knows I\\u2019m there. I also feel this thread of self satisfaction that she\\u2019s not one of the organizers - she didn\\u2019t have survival skills. Her skills were based on what she could suck off of others, so she\\u2019s demoted into that part of the social fabric of her group and I will truthfully admit to feeling a smack of satisfaction over that. The dream ends with us folding up our camps and putting them all back in our backpacks. You wouldn\\u2019t even know we were there. We\\u2019re brushing any vegetation that has been flattened with sticks with leaves on them and we continue on our trek.\"],[\"\\u201cShady Contracts\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room full of people involved in conversations with each other. I\\u2019m sitting with a group of friends having a pleasant conversation when someone taps on my shoulder and says, \\u201cThat woman over there would like to speak with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little annoyed that I\\u2019m being interrupted during something social to do something that feels like work. I look over that it\\u2019s Claire, a studio owner of someone I used to work with but I\\u2019ve parted ways due to her unethical practices. I refuse to go over there and just tell the messenger that I\\u2019m busy. I continue talking with my friends, but he\\u2019s persistent. He won\\u2019t leave me alone. He stalks me everywhere. So I finally go over there just to tell her to piss off. There\\u2019s a pile of documents on the table and I see they\\u2019re spread out a bit. I see sticking out from one of them, my name. So now I\\u2019m sucked into engaging with them because I want to know why my name is on a piece of paper. They should not have anything to do with me - we never signed a contract, though I always wanted to. So there\\u2019s nothing that has my signature on it. He sees me glance at it and my arm is reaching to pull it out from the bottom. He swipes it first. He is her representative - at some point he\\u2019s told me this or I\\u2019ve just assumed it from the conversation, but he\\u2019s definitely behaving like it now. So I say, \\u201cWhat is that with my name on it?\\u201d He says it\\u2019s a contract. I say it can\\u2019t be because I\\u2019ve never signed anything with Claire here or her studio. He says, \\u201cIt says here that you release her from any responsibility for any shady interactions or any responsibility for her past actions. \\u201c I\\u2019m a little bit outraged and refuse. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m not signing anything like that. It\\u2019s a lie!\\u201d I also don\\u2019t think that she should escape accountability for her actions. At this point she speaks and says she\\u2019s applying for a new business and she needs all her past employees to sign this contract in order for her to have a pristine business record and move forward to something else. I still refuse to sign it because it\\u2019s dishonest. I want the piece of paper and I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking this with me.\\u201d The representative says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take that with you. It\\u2019s a legal piece of paper that doesn\\u2019t belong to you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes I can because it has my name on it.\\u201d Then Claire says, \\u201cYou can take it with you.\\u201d She reaches out to shake my hand and I realize that there\\u2019s a bulky piece of folded up paper in it and something that feels cold, like ceramic. So I look down in my hand and examine the ceramic thing. The closest I can describe it is those ceramic things in old lady\\u2019s bathrooms that you put the end of the toothpaste in and start to roll from the bottom up so that it squeezes all the toothpaste out. It looks like that, but is twice as wide, probably 6 inches wide. There\\u2019s a small chain attached to it. At the end is a tiny hook that looks somewhat like a paperclip that\\u2019s been partially unfolded. I\\u2019m thinking, what the heck is this? It\\u2019s glazed in white with blue and has my name on it. Is this something to mount a piece of paper on? There\\u2019s a hook and chain on it. So I\\u2019m puzzling over this. Then I open up the eight-times folded piece of paper and see that it\\u2019s a check for $201 from her to me. I realize that she\\u2019s trying to pay me for my silence. I still refuse to sign it but I walk away with the check and this bound thing that would bind me to her forever symbolically. Although I didn\\u2019t get the piece of paper with my name on it - I didn\\u2019t sign it. I walk away and I\\u2019m feeling like I don\\u2019t even want this check or this ceramic thing. So I turn around and she\\u2019s still at the table, but I\\u2019m walking towards them and all the footsteps I take aren\\u2019t bringing me closer to the table. I can still see her and I\\u2019m not any closer. This is really frustrating me. Then the scene morphs into I\\u2019m trying to walk through this row of beds, like you\\u2019d see in a television orphanage (I\\u2019ve never actually been in an orphanage). There\\u2019s a bunch of single beds lined up and they all have people in them and all their belongings with them, like homeless people. I have to step over all of them because mine\\u2019s at the very end. It has a change of clothing with a hairbrush, toothpaste, some snack-like foods that come already pre-packaged, like cookies in a bag. There\\u2019s a television there as well. Everyone has their own television and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I guess this is where I have to sleep for now.\\u201d I\\u2019m angry that I have to step over all these people. I\\u2019m angry that someone is partially lying on my own bed. Just as I lie down in it to get comfortable, these two teenagers come up and say that it\\u2019s their turn to have the bed now. They have this piece of paper to prove it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t even notice that was on the piece of paper and now I don\\u2019t have anywhere to sleep and I\\u2019m mad and I\\u2019m swearing and I\\u2019m yelling and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cFine, but you can\\u2019t have it until all my stuff\\u2019s gone. Get out, stand back there and I\\u2019ll tell you when I\\u2019m ready.\\u201d I start taking my sheets and blankets off my bed, and I\\u2019m taking all the little things and putting them in my backpack. I do that, step over all the people and leave really angry. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Explosion\\u201d I\\u2019m in a garage and it\\u2019s open. It\\u2019s set up like a garage sale - the garage is open, there\\u2019s all kinds of stuff, tables going down the driveway and all kinds of eclectic assortment of things for sale. Then there\\u2019s some other bigger things like bicycles and whatnot and some furniture and other freestanding items. It\\u2019s dense with material items as well as a traffic of people going back and forth. This is not my house. This is my friend\\u2019s house. He\\u2019s currently playing his old drum set at the back of the garage. He\\u2019s facing out so he can see who comes and goes and be of assistance if someone asks a question. I\\u2019m just hanging out there chatting casually with him. One of the women that comes up is an attractive brunette and she\\u2019s wearing a mini skirt. I notice that her body is very svelte like she works out and I notice this and think, wow she\\u2019s really attractive. She starts asking my friend about some item that she\\u2019s interested in. As he is answering her, she turns around so her back is to him, and she bends over to pick something up. Then this explosion comes out of her butt and the whole garage is sprayed with shit! It\\u2019s all over everything. I\\u2019m incredulous. I\\u2019m astonished that she\\u2019s done this and she just stands up and acts like nothing\\u2019s happened. She doesn\\u2019t apologize and she just walks away. My friend has got some of this on him and instead of cleaning himself up, he goes over and starts wiping up the stuff that is on the floor around the yard sale items without seeming to notice that he\\u2019s got some of it on him and he needs to go wash his face. I\\u2019m just really disgusted. For some reason I\\u2019m mute. I\\u2019m not saying anything, but I\\u2019m in horror. Then the dream shifts from that scene. I\\u2019m in another friend\\u2019s house. She\\u2019s a person I know in real life, she\\u2019s a substitute mom to me. I\\u2019m in her house and I\\u2019m upstairs. I\\u2019m helping sort something out. It goes from that scene of sorting to a restaurant I worked at while in University.\"],[\"\\u201cBoundaries and Brats\\u201d This dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019ve had lots of dreams set in this house. It\\u2019s long and narrow, although the rooms are plenty big enough - they\\u2019re just longer than they are wide. There're houses in New Orleans called shotgun houses because they\\u2019re long like that and the entrance to all the rooms are off the hallway, so if you\\u2019re driving by and shooting a gun, you could shoot a bullet in the front door and it goes all the way through the house and out the backdoor. So I guess it\\u2019s a shotgun house. We\\u2019re in the very back room of this house, which is my bedroom. We\\u2019re having a house discussion, so all the people that live there are having a conversation about pets. We have lots and I love pets. But one of them has a cow and I don\\u2019t want it lying on my bed because it runs around outside and in the backyard, too, where there\\u2019s poops lying around on the grass, so it\\u2019s got poops on its feet or it could have at any given time. I don\\u2019t want that on my bed. So I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cAnimals, if they can be trained to stay on the floor, then that\\u2019s fine, they\\u2019re allowed in my room. But if they\\u2019re up on my bed, then I won\\u2019t also allow them in my room.\\u201d The cow is in the room while we\\u2019re saying this. As I\\u2019m talking, it\\u2019s doing this sad eyes and pouty mouth. First it puts its head in my lap and looks sad, then it rolls a little bit at a time, like a toddler does when they\\u2019re limp and you\\u2019re trying to get them to walk and they just turn into a blob. It\\u2019s doing this. Then it\\u2019s on the bed. So I push it off and it\\u2019s heavy - it\\u2019s got a great big belly and it\\u2019s bigger than I am and it\\u2019s head is the size of my torso. But I push it back onto the floor and it looks at me mournfully. But I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, get off my bed.\\u201d But the people I\\u2019m having this discussion with don\\u2019t even hear me. And they say, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s alright if the cow is on your bed as long as your bed is made and the quilt is on.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo! I just finished saying, not on my bed under any circumstances!\\u201d Then the dream instantaneously is full of people and one of the roommates is having a birthday party for an 8-10 year old kid. So it feels like there\\u2019s hundreds of these kids around and they start opening my drawers and pulling out my shirts. One of them has a pair of scissors and they\\u2019re making costumes to dress up with. She starts to cut up one of my shirts and use the pieces of it for something else. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not allowed to do that, get out of my dresser. Close the drawer.\\u201d She looks at me and rolls her eyes like that 13 year old girl way - make a face. Then she leaves, but I see her looking back as she\\u2019s leaving and I intuit that she\\u2019s just waiting until I\\u2019m out of my room and she\\u2019s going to come back in anyway. So I put my clothes that they\\u2019ve taken out back in the dresser drawers. So there\\u2019s nothing on the floor and my room is back intact again. I close the door. I go through this crowd of kids to look for the roommate who is responsible for them. This person has no defining features, I can\\u2019t tell if they\\u2019re a man or woman, they\\u2019re just a roommate. I say to the roommate, \\u201cYou need to tell these kids that they\\u2019re not allowed in my room.\\u201d They\\u2019re like a phantom. I don\\u2019t really get a response from them and I realize it\\u2019s my responsibility to keep these kids out of my room. So I turn around and I see my bedroom door is open. So I go back in. This time I\\u2019m angry and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI told you guys not to do this and you\\u2019re doing it anyway! I\\u2019m taking your scissors and all this stuff you\\u2019ve made because you\\u2019re not respecting this!\\u201d I kick them out of my room again with these angry words and push them out with my hands. I can feel my hands making contact with them. Now they\\u2019re giving me the angry teenager rolling eyes angry look. So they\\u2019re looking back at me and I\\u2019m standing there like grrrr. I look down the hallway and the roommate is now aware of my displeasure and decides to take them to a movie instead. But it\\u2019s communicated to me that it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re respecting my boundaries or making the kids aware that there are boundaries they need to follow, but that \\u201cOh well Freya is grumpy and terrible so we\\u2019re just going to go somewhere else.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cCommunity\\u201d There\\u2019s a lot of mundane stuff that I won\\u2019t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they\\u2019re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she\\u2019s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re not triggered that you see her.\\u201d And my non-dream psyche answers back, \\u201cNo, hmm, I\\u2019m not.\\u201d But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we\\u2019re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it\\u2019s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We\\u2019re having casual conversations. It\\u2019s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There\\u2019s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He\\u2019s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he\\u2019s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he\\u2019s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it\\u2019s odd. I realize as I\\u2019m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn\\u2019t stand living there - one of the things I\\u2019ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that\\u2019s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there\\u2019s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he\\u2019s gathered all these people together. We\\u2019ve all brought our own food. He\\u2019s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who\\u2019s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property\\u2019s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it\\u2019s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it\\u2019s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. \\u201cOh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!\\u201d \\u201cI can store my snowmobile here!\\u201d \\u201cI can put my motorcycle here!\\u201d \\u201cOh here\\u2019s a big place I can take my dog out to run!\\u201d So it\\u2019s this whole building of community and that\\u2019s what the dream was about.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Wall\\u201d The second dream, I\\u2019m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I\\u2019m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they\\u2019ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won\\u2019t be aware of what they\\u2019ve actually been doing. I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they\\u2019re hiding, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you even hiding that? It\\u2019s just a book.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I\\u2019m still a teenager in it, though, and I\\u2019ve moved out of their house but I\\u2019ve gone back for a visit. There\\u2019s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there\\u2019s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I\\u2019m looking at what she\\u2019s brought out. I see a couple things and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! That was mine! I don\\u2019t remember hiding that and I didn\\u2019t even notice I was missing it.\\u201d So in the dream, we\\u2019re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don\\u2019t know what to do with mine. I guess I don\\u2019t have any pockets. I can\\u2019t seem to think in the dream, \\u201cOh why don\\u2019t I just take them with me?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m encumbered with the idea that the mom can\\u2019t see it and I\\u2019ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, \\u201cMom, Freya\\u2019s been hiding things in the wall.\\u201d Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she\\u2019s really disappointed in me that I\\u2019ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I\\u2019m thinking I don\\u2019t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I\\u2019m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.\"],[\"\\u201cNo Voice\\u201d This time the setting is different. I\\u2019m in a mall and I\\u2019m teaching yoga. I\\u2019m not in a room so there\\u2019s just posts and no walls. It\\u2019s a designated area for my yoga class but there aren\\u2019t any walls. The mall is packed, there\\u2019s lots of shoppers. People are going about their own business. The people that have come in for yoga have intentionally come for the class. However, I\\u2019m unable to organize them. The time I\\u2019m supposed to start the class, they\\u2019re still talking to each other. It\\u2019s like they can\\u2019t hear me. It\\u2019s like trying to shepherd chickens. They\\u2019re running all over the place. I\\u2019m trying to get their attention and I\\u2019m trying to teach. As soon as I get them organized with their mats down, I say about six words and they\\u2019ll wander off again or start talking to each other or look at something from a window that\\u2019s in the mall. At one point, out of frustration, there\\u2019s a carny with a headset on. I walk over and say to them, \\u201cI notice you\\u2019re not using your headset right now. Is it okay if I borrow it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d So I put it on. He shows me how to use it and I walk back over. It works for about 6 seconds. Then the class is the same. Now 35 minutes have gone by and I haven\\u2019t even started my class. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Recital\\u201d This is a really long dream, so I\\u2019m going to summarize some of the parts. It opens up and I\\u2019m at a wedding dance - a wedding celebration where people are dancing. There\\u2019s log tables with people sitting at them and food. The point of this part of it is I\\u2019m surrounded by people I do not want to be surrounded by. I love dancing but i can\\u2019t find anybody I want to dance with. And the people at this wedding are people I don\\u2019t want to share a meal with, so it\\u2019s not very much fun. The scene immediately shifts and I\\u2019m in a farmhouse in a completely different era. I'm participating in making and preserving food. So various people are doing various things. There\\u2019s some people who are actually churning butter. There are people that are milking cows and bringing the milk in pails to the people that are churning the butter. I am aware that there\\u2019s a smokehouse and there\\u2019s people building the fires and curing and smoking meats. It's outside though. Both of these are outside - the smokehouse is further away. Of course the cows are further away than that. The churning butter is closer to the house and I\\u2019m actually in the farmhouse. I\\u2019m in the kitchen. I\\u2019ve been chopping and making what appears to be kimchi which is odd given the historical setting. I\\u2019m putting it all in mason jars and sealing them. I can still smell the aroma of boiling vinegar in my nose. When I finish this, I turn around and Omar is there again. He\\u2019s distanced from me again, so he doesn\\u2019t really know me. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s Omar\\u2019s body but not his spirit in it. He sort of doesn\\u2019t know who I am. He tells me that he\\u2019s been aging Scotch. He tells me what he did with it. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did it work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Then the time speeds up and all of a sudden it\\u2019s today\\u2019s time and I have the two kids that I have. I\\u2019m telling Omar that I have to leave to take my son to his dance lesson. I ask him if he wants to come. He says, no he can\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m disappointed, but I have to go. I leave to go out the farmhouse door. This other guy that used to be a neighborhood thief hops in the car - in the backseat - as I\\u2019m leaving. I end up driving him to Brantford where he gets out and takes off somewhere. So I\\u2019ve picked up both my kids. I\\u2019m taking them to the dance lesson. There\\u2019s been some fiddling around and delays. When I was trying to get in the car, I was trying to get this thief out of it, and I think I\\u2019ve barely made it in time. I think the lesson is an hour, but as it turns out, it\\u2019s only a half hour and as soon as we get there, it\\u2019s over. So I take my kids back into the car and my son\\u2019s dad is in the backseat. He gets out and checks the oil level in the trunk and he\\u2019s spilling it everywhere. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I didn\\u2019t even want you to do that because I\\u2019m in a hurry again. Now why is he here delaying me?\\u201d Then he disappears and I\\u2019m immediately back in the parking lot of hte dance lesson building again. Time just skipped to another day. So I\\u2019m taking my kids back in and we're on time this time. I walk them into the recital hall. My son is acting in it and my daughter is dancing. I\\u2019m sitting up really close to him and I realize that he\\u2019s got different makeup on and he\\u2019s got an elaborate costume. He\\u2019s acting like an old man. He\\u2019s supposed to be chauffeuring another person from the play. I\\u2019m astonished at what a good job he\\u2019s doing with the acting right down to the smallest movements of his body. The rehearsal is finished and both my kids are given parts, none of which they\\u2019ve auditioned for, but they\\u2019re lead roles and neither one of my kids are lead-role people. They accept them graciously. They\\u2019re supposed to walk up onto the stage - each kid has done this - stand there to wait to be bestowed some kind of role and then curtsy and bow and exit out the other side of the stage and come back to their seats. So they\\u2019ve done this. When they get to their seats, they say, \\u201cOh no, Mom, I didn\\u2019t want these and I don\\u2019t want to be the lead role\\u201d and blah blah blah. Then I tell them, \\u201cWell, you should say something.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cNobody ever complains. They just take the roles. We don\\u2019t want to be the first ones to complain.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, if you don't want to do it, speak up. Maybe you could just ask if you can speak to them separately.\\u201d So my daughter approaches the head dance role person and I can\\u2019t hear what they\\u2019re saying, but they\\u2019re speaking. A moment later this head person says that my kids have something to say. They\\u2019ve set up this thing - like a platform. They wheel it onto the stage. It's long and skinny, about 4 feet long and about a foot wide. It\\u2019s on wheels and it\\u2019s got a railing around it, only on three sides, though. So they enter it from the back where there\\u2019s no railing. They have to stand in this and the dance role person makes them announce what they have asked to say. So it almost feels like a humiliation, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a humiliation or an honoring as they\\u2019ve put them in this railing thing and wheeled them onto the stage. They say, \\u201dUm, we don\\u2019t want these roles. Thank you very much, but we graciously decline these roles.\\u201d Then the audience starts clapping. They don\\u2019t look upset, so I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cPhew, oh look at them. I\\u2019m glad that they have been true to themselves.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Rose Farm\\u201d This dream begins in the house where I grew up. I\\u2019m in the kitchen waiting for a phone call. Some man is in the basement and he\\u2019s making something and periodically he comes upstairs. He\\u2019s wearing a toolbelt, he has a saw and he grabs some nails that are in a box on top of the fridge and goes back down with them. So, each time he trucks up and down the stairs, I\\u2019m aware that he has not finished making what he\\u2019s making down there. There\\u2019s a special delivery that comes to the front door. I answer it and bring it back to the table to open. It\\u2019s a package that was sent by a woman named Maureen that composes aerobics classes for GoodLife Fitness in Canada. It says I\\u2019m sorry for your loss and open it up and it\\u2019s this choreography for an aerobics class. However, it\\u2019s just the musical score. There\\u2019s no direction of what to put with it. There\\u2019s another person in the kitchen now and she\\u2019s someone that teaches this class. I show her the score and say, \\u201cUm, this is a nice gesture but how useful is it without the steps? There\\u2019s no choreography. It's only the music.\\u201d She looks at it with me and says, \\u201cHmmm,\\u201d and starts to listen to it and see if she can put steps to it. She gives up and says, \\u201cthis is impossible.\\u201d She sits down and then I look at it again. I realize that the beat is in things you can do in 8 and if you take 5 steps to the front, 1 to the side, 1 to the back and go back to where you started it does equal 8. So I\\u2019m starting to try to figure this out and then the phone rings. It\\u2019s Maureen from Good Life and she\\u2019s in a peppy aerobics instructor voice, \\u201cHi, this is Maureen! Did you get my package?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, I did, but I\\u2019m not quite sure what to do with it seeing there\\u2019s no choreography.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh well, there\\u2019s a word for that.\\u201d And I reply back, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s Word!\\u201d as a rapper would say it. There\\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone and she\\u2019s somewhat offended. The conversation ends. I go back into the kitchen, fully prepared to keep trying to figure this out for myself when the carpenter has completed this small box. He gives it to me and says, \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d As soon as I take the box in my hand, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m on this old farm. The farm has a sign in front of it and it\\u2019s called The Rose Farm. There\\u2019s a pump so you can pump the water up out of the ground. Everything is made of granite, which is a rock, and it\\u2019s faded pink. It really breathes history. The farm is strangely quiet, it\\u2019s almost like a museum. There\\u2019s no real activity going on in it. I go inside the farmhouse and there\\u2019s an old woman sitting there. My cat is with me. I say to her, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought something to comfort you.\\u201d I set the box down on the table. She\\u2019s sad. She looks up. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought my cat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think mine only has about an hour left.\\u201d Rather than seeing where her cat is lying, I see it as a vision in front of my eyes and it\\u2019s kind of suspended between the ground and the ceiling. The cat looks old - it looks like a 25 year old cat. Its fur is matted and its skin is emaciated away from its bones. The joints are big and round like arthritic. My cat is a lot younger, it\\u2019s black. It comes with me into the kitchen and my cat sits down beside me. We both wait there with her. Then I look at the wooden box I\\u2019ve set on the table and then I realize that it\\u2019s a coffin for her cat and she says, \\u201cThank you, I\\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here.\\u201d She takes the coffin and goes into the room and doesn't come back - neither one of them. And then my cat and I sit in the kitchen. I\\u2019m patting my cat and then the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cLima\\u201d This dream starts as though I\\u2019m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There\\u2019s a function, so it\\u2019s quite crowded and there\\u2019s a lot of people, most of whom I don\\u2019t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There\\u2019s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there\\u2019s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it\\u2019s over and it\\u2019s been over for some time. He\\u2019s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I\\u2019m reading the letter, it\\u2019s two pages long and there\\u2019s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, \\u201cDid he say anything to you personally?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just news.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m reading it again. There\\u2019s a story about his cat named Lima. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, what\\u2019s happened to him?\\u201d because he has two of them and he\\u2019s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I\\u2019m reading that the cat is missing. He\\u2019s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that\\u2019s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he\\u2019s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I\\u2019m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what\\u2019s in the letter like he knows what\\u2019s in the letter and he\\u2019s going off about what\\u2019s in the letter. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what\\u2019s in here.\\u201d Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I\\u2019m over in the UK, which is a trip I\\u2019ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I\\u2019m over there. So now I\\u2019m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I\\u2019m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I\\u2019m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I\\u2019m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There\\u2019s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it\\u2019s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend\\u2019s flat and knock on the door. It\\u2019s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It\\u2019s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it\\u2019s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he\\u2019s asking me how my trip was. I\\u2019m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, \\u201cYes, one of my daughters is here.\\u201d Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.\\u201d That\\u2019s all he says. I know from that remark that she\\u2019s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she\\u2019s with some of her friends. They\\u2019re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she\\u2019s changed it to Grassy. I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.\\u201d She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, \\u201cIt was nice to see you.\\u201d I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I\\u2019m talking to my artist friend. I say, \\u201cOh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can\\u2019t keep up with it.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019ve each got some of you in them.\\u201d He kind of laughs and I ask him if he\\u2019s found his cat. He says, \\u201cNo, not yet.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, I saw the cat.\\u201d And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, \\u201cHmm, let\\u2019s just go check that out.\\u201d We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Concert\\u201d The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I\\u2019m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don\\u2019t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It\\u2019s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I\\u2019m waiting for my turn, there\\u2019s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It\\u2019s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it\\u2019s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don\\u2019t question this in the dream - it\\u2019s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I\\u2019m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I\\u2019m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I\\u2019m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I\\u2019m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven\\u2019t put them in the bank and they aren\\u2019t very safe where they are rolled up and put in this ceramic vase. So it sparks my memories. I put them back in the vase. It\\u2019s too late to go to the bank tonight, but I will go tomorrow. Then I go back downstairs. Omar and his friend Al and a girl he\\u2019s taking with him have arrived and they\\u2019re in the living room. We are happy to see each other. I go down and am talking to them for a while. I see what he\\u2019s wearing and tell him I\\u2019m going to get changed. I go back upstairs and someone is in the shower. I find a rolled up wad of money on the floor. I turn around and Omar is behind me. I say, \\u201cIs this yours?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Oh, there\\u2019s so many people in this house and we don\\u2019t know all of them. Don\\u2019t go downstairs and just say, \\u2018whose wad of money is this?\\u2019\\u201d I say, \\u201cI won\\u2019t. I\\u2019m going to go put it in my room and I\\u2019ll find a way to make it known to someone so they know their money is missing.\\u201d I go back into my room and I change. I pick out a black mini skirt with gold thread around the hem. I think it\\u2019s very pretty and sparkly. I choose a white blouse and a jacket that goes overtop just a few inches above the hem of the skirt. I put on my black tights and a pair of bulky socks and boots that look really nice. Then I go downstairs and Omar tells me I look very nice. But I turn and Al\\u2019s friend (I don\\u2019t know her name) is wearing the same thing I am. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s really odd. That wasn\\u2019t what she was wearing when I went up the stairs.\\u201d I look over at Omar and he\\u2019s laughing. I shrug it off and I say to everyone in the room, \\u201cHow much money is everyone bringing?\\u201d So I\\u2019m trying to get them to look in their wallets. The person whose money it is that\\u2019s missing will realize it\\u2019s lost and I can return the money to whoever it is. But they all check their wallets and they say different amounts. I say, \\u201cOkay, well I\\u2019m going to go upstairs and get my money.\\u201d While I\\u2019m going upstairs, the person is still in the shower and I realize it\\u2019s my nephew, Jared. I wonder if the money belongs to him. I put the wad of money in the same ceramic vase as the other checks that I need to deposit in the bank. Then I look through my own drawers and I find my wallet. I take out 2 twenties and put them in the little clutch that I\\u2019ve decided to take with me for the night. I go back downstairs again. Someone else is in the living room and she\\u2019s showing Omar this fabric and saying, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this beautiful? It would make a nice skirt.\\u201d I look and say, \\u201cOh yes, it is.\\u201d This is all gold and if you look closely, the gold thread has created patterns of flowers and it\\u2019s shimmering. This gold is really quite beautiful. Then suddenly, it\\u2019s not fabric anymore. It is a skirt - a longer skirt. She says, \\u201cThis skirt costs $2,000 and people pay that for it and only wear it once. Within a couple of weeks it\\u2019s in a punk rock thrift store and that\\u2019s where I found it. This would look really nice on you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWow, you\\u2019re giving it to me?!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThank you so much!\\u201d I was thinking maybe I\\u2019ll change into it for tonight and then decide not to because it\\u2019s a long skirt and I want to save it for another time. I ask her if she would like some money for it. She hesitates and doesn\\u2019t answer and I\\u2019m thinking I could give her another twenty. I\\u2019m waiting and waiting, but she doesn\\u2019t answer me, so I thank her graciously. I go back upstairs and I put it in my room. I look into my wallet and I get out another $20 just in case to give to her. So I go back downstairs and by this time, I\\u2019m becoming conscious that it feels like it's the same time and all these activities are happening and we still haven\\u2019t left for the concert. So I say to everyone, \\u201cShouldn\\u2019t we be leaving?\\u201d They say, \\u201cYes, it starts really soon.\\u201d I look out the door and I see that someone else is coming in and they need to get ready for the concert. Right at that time, there\\u2019s a sliver in the time-space continuum and I\\u2019m at work. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to get back to meet everyone for the concert.\\u201d Then when I'm thinking that, that same time frame fabric opens up and I\\u2019m back in the house. I think, \\u201cOh good, everyone is still here.\\u201d But then we\\u2019re waiting for someone else to get ready. She comes back downstairs and she\\u2019s wearing that shimmering gold skirt. I think, \\u201cWow, this is really odd.\\u201d But again I just shrug it off and I\\u2019m trying to get everyone to go. I say, \\u201cWe should call for a cab.\\u201d But Omar\\u2019s friend is driving. I tell them there isn\\u2019t enough room for everyone in the one car. Then suddenly they have other rides and we get in the car and go. We arrive at the concert hall and I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s general admission. We find a place to stand on the floor. I feel like I\\u2019m in the masonic temple or the music hall. I decide it\\u2019s the music hall. It\\u2019s quite dark. The band is playing but there\\u2019s no lights on the stage or upstairs on the balcony. But I recognize the structure and I think, \\u201cOh I know where we are.\\u201d Then we start dancing as though the concert is just a background. It\\u2019s good. Omar and I are dancing and enjoying ourselves. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Two Sisters\\u201d The setting for this dream is my grandparents' house on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The house is really spacious - it\\u2019s very large like a sprawling ranch style house with a deep full basement that you wouldn\\u2019t even know was there until you went into it. There were so many rooms. I used to get lost in there as a child. I think that\\u2019s significant. Both levels open out onto the shore of Lake Ontario. In the bottom level, there\\u2019s been a lot of excavation. The big patio doors open out into a lower area of land and you can walk straight from there down to the shore where there was a boathouse. It\\u2019s also concealed until you get right there. It\\u2019s dug out into the shore. The upper level does the same thing - it has a greenhouse on the side of it and you walk out that door onto the upper level which is a garden. There's plenty of natural light and it feels spacious. Everything is wider and deeper and taller when you\\u2019re in there. In the dream, those details remain consistent with how the house was in real life. I\\u2019m in that house and I\\u2019m walking down the long upstairs hallway into the kitchen. I see someone I know. I realize that she\\u2019s also living in this house and I didn\\u2019t realize she was there. We don\\u2019t speak at first. She\\u2019s just going about her own thing making some food for herself in the large kitchen. I leave the kitchen and walk outside through the greenhouse. I\\u2019m sitting in the garden and gazing out on the expanse of water and it\\u2019s just so spacious. It feels really good. I\\u2019m just resting. I\\u2019m hearing the sounds of bees. I\\u2019m hearing the pollinators as they move from the flowers. My body feels the buzz of life. I stay there for some unknown period of time and then I go back into the house. No one is in the kitchen this time. I walk through the kitchen into a den, a sitting room. The den has two doors - one from the kitchen and one into the hallway. So I walk through it and it\\u2019s an interesting shape. It has eight sides. I\\u2019ve always wondered at the positioning of it. It feels like a pivotal point. I leave it and I walk into the hallway and the roommate or sister that had previously been in the kitchen is coming towards me. We meet in the hallway and she says to me, \\u201cI have something to show you.\\u201d So I\\u2019m engaged in a conversation with her and I don\\u2019t remember what it is. She says, \\u201cJust a minute, I have to go get something else from my room.\\u201d She walks back to her room which is in the basement, so it\\u2019s on the lower level. I follow her a little ways behind. We go down the stairs and I notice that she goes into a room that I previously noticed had a lot of stuff in it. Although I don\\u2019t say this out loud, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow that\\u2019s a lot of stuff. How does she move in that room?\\u201d She goes into the room then comes back out and says to me, as though she heard my thoughts: \\u201cYeah I\\u2019m unpacking everything and re-sorting this all out,\\u201d as though this is a reason for why there\\u2019s so much stuff out all over the place. She says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve cleared this spot.\\u201d And without leaving where we\\u2019re talking, I see inside her room - I\\u2019m not in it. It\\u2019s a square and has stuff everywhere covering every surface of the floor. But there\\u2019s this one spot about 4 feet into the room. It\\u2019s a 4 feet long by 2 feet wide clear spot. She says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019m able to navigate through this clear spot I\\u2019ve made.\\u201d Then my consciousness zooms into the future and sees that she\\u2019s navigated this clear spot. While she was in the process of taking everything out and sorting through it - because she was able to navigate through this clear spot - she\\u2019s become quite comfortable in it. It\\u2019s kind of like she\\u2019s let go of the original intent for taking everything out like that now she\\u2019s comfortable with the clear spot she\\u2019s made. She says to me, \\u201cI still intend to finish this, though. I\\u2019m okay with this spot I\\u2019ve just made. But I will finish it someday in my own way.\\u201d I\\u2019ve forgotten what happens next, but we\\u2019re back upstairs together and she\\u2019s asking me if I want to do something with her. Then another sister comes out and I realize she\\u2019s living here, too, but she hadn\\u2019t been home. She moves really quickly. I realize there\\u2019s some tension between them. The other sister is really frustrated with the first sister because she\\u2019s not moving quickly and she feels that she will be left behind by the first sister. I feel the tension between them, but do not know what to do. I feel torn about doing the something with the first sister while the other sister is still upset at how slowly she\\u2019s moving.\"],[\"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I\\u2019m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There\\u2019s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I\\u2019m packing bags. There\\u2019s a reason, although I don\\u2019t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I\\u2019m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing that?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, I have to do this anyway.\\u201d Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: \\u201cHow old is that child?\\u201d I look down in puzzlement and see that she\\u2019s only five. I think, \\u201cHow did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.\\u201d I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It\\u2019s not safe.\\u201d So, I tell him I\\u2019ve changed my mind. Then I\\u2019m uncertain what to do. Now I\\u2019m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we\\u2019re about to go to. I tell her that it\\u2019s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She\\u2019s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I\\u2019m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It\\u2019s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there\\u2019s one washroom to the left - it\\u2019s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There\\u2019s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we\\u2019re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I\\u2019m able to hear the one person I know - he\\u2019s an author - that he\\u2019s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he\\u2019s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we\\u2019re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I\\u2019m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I\\u2019m getting the feeling that there\\u2019s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don\\u2019t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there\\u2019s two of them - they\\u2019re also talking in hushed tones. I\\u2019m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I\\u2019ve come to this house for and it\\u2019s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn\\u2019t just an idea for a book, it\\u2019s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, \\u201cDo you recognize that?\\u201d I said yes. He says, \\u201cAfter this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.\\u201d So I agree. Then someone comes in that\\u2019s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he\\u2019s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he\\u2019s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s planning this way to get out that\\u2019s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that\\u2019s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I\\u2019m not really listening. I\\u2019m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who\\u2019s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that\\u2019s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat are they up to?\\u201d So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It\\u2019s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there\\u2019s urine all over the seat and it\\u2019s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s urine all over it. There\\u2019s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she\\u2019s still five and as I\\u2019m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I\\u2019ve been talking to and he\\u2019s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he\\u2019s drying it with another towel. He\\u2019s just had a shower. So he\\u2019s involved in what he\\u2019s doing. There\\u2019s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I\\u2019ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I\\u2019ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cWooden Ship\\u201d In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It\\u2019s between 40 and 60 feet long. It\\u2019s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he\\u2019s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it\\u2019s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It\\u2019s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It\\u2019s got debris filtered from the water as it\\u2019s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There\\u2019s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I\\u2019m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven\\u2019t gone all the way out into the body of water. We\\u2019re still going through the channel. I\\u2019m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: \\u201cRandy, it\\u2019s too shallow here, we\\u2019ll never make it through! We\\u2019re going to run aground!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, no, we\\u2019ll be fine. I\\u2019ve done this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s maneuvering the ship and I\\u2019m positive it\\u2019s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you\\u2019re going to scrape your keel. You\\u2019re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don\\u2019t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the ship just didn't run aground.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s because it has no keel.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! So how are we staying balanced?\\u201d Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it\\u2019s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, \\u201cOh, that explains that.\\u201d The dream speeds through the day on the water like it\\u2019s just a minute and we\\u2019re coming back through this same channel. Now it\\u2019s time to tie up. I\\u2019m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that\\u2019s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I\\u2019m climbing up, I realize it\\u2019s not attached to the wall and it\\u2019s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn\\u2019t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I\\u2019m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it\\u2019s a platform, like walking the plank. It\\u2019s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He\\u2019s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I\\u2019m okay. Now I\\u2019m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I\\u2019m standing there talking to him saying, \\u201cHow is this boat balanced without a keel?\\u201d He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it\\u2019s made of wood so it must be light plus it\\u2019s buoyant. There\\u2019s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It\\u2019s actually a hole. I\\u2019m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn\\u2019t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s Crime in Cafes\\u201d It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don\\u2019t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They\\u2019re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don\\u2019t even know how deep it goes. So there\\u2019s a self-serve area at one end - that\\u2019s the end that goes on and on and I don\\u2019t know how deep it goes. At the other end that\\u2019s open, it has long tables where you can take what you\\u2019ve selected and eat there with people. It\\u2019s packed. So, the dream opens and I\\u2019m sitting at a table. I\\u2019m not eating though. I\\u2019m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She\\u2019s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it\\u2019s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we\\u2019re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There\\u2019s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there\\u2019s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it\\u2019s finished, we go to the room next door. There\\u2019s another teacher in there that we\\u2019re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he\\u2019s trying to undermine the first teacher. We\\u2019ve gotten our lunch out and we\\u2019re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we\\u2019re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We\\u2019re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she\\u2019s still there. We share this information with her. She\\u2019s grateful. We tell her that we\\u2019ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you here at the same time the next day.\\u201d So while I\\u2019m lining up to go and get food, first there\\u2019s this thing that happens with gum. There\\u2019s a direction by the cashier - it\\u2019s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, \\u201cWhy are they doing this? I don\\u2019t even want all this gum.\\u201d So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! $50 for something I don\\u2019t even want.\\u201d However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I\\u2019m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don\\u2019t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I\\u2019m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he\\u2019s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no! That\\u2019s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!\\u201d He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn\\u2019t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I\\u2019ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don\\u2019t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There\\u2019s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It\\u2019s crowded and it\\u2019s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There\\u2019s people walking in the street. It\\u2019s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I\\u2019m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what\\u2019s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He\\u2019s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They\\u2019re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don\\u2019t know if they've purchased them or if he\\u2019s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what\\u2019s in the bag. They open it up and there\\u2019s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We\\u2019re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.\\u201d They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He\\u2019s giving it away and he\\u2019s giving it to children. He\\u2019s helping people. I think, \\u201cOh! Well he\\u2019s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they\\u2019re looking for this person?\\u201d So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn\\u2019t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren\\u2019t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I\\u2019m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she\\u2019s there. She\\u2019s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50\\u2019s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it\\u2019s got a rounded collar and she\\u2019s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s dressed up really nicely. She\\u2019s in her good dress.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t see me. In fact, we don\\u2019t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she\\u2019s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I\\u2019m supposed to have, knowing that I can\\u2019t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she\\u2019s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I\\u2019d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can\\u2019t really. I wonder if she\\u2019s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He\\u2019s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He\\u2019s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cyborg in Me\\u201d I entered my dream space as a cyborg. There was no one else in it. I felt nothing. There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn\\u2019t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that\\u2019s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That\\u2019s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn\\u2019t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Nothing\\u201d It seems to me that my apathy and feeling of not belonging, not being able to play anywhere, or seeing that my skills are not needed or wanted anywhere has soaked into my dream...All it was is a dry, hot African steppe. There was nothing in it, no activity. Just a steppe.\"],[\"\\u201cGrey Stone Staircase\\u201d I\\u2019m outside. The landscape is not a river, but a stream, maybe 50 yards wide. There\\u2019s a bridge over top that's made of grey stone and cement. The part you would walk over is no longer there, only the foundation is there. The grey stone part of the bridge spreads down the banks of the stream on either side of it, as well as going down and up the stream. It\\u2019s really, really high. There are stairs carved out of the stone. When you climb up to the top, you can see the air - it\\u2019s whipping around. I can feel my hair whipping across my face. The mist from the river is mixed in with this air, so my hair quickly turns into small ropes and is slapping against my skin. My clothes are slapping against my legs. Looking down creates this really strong sense of vertigo. I\\u2019ve been told to climb up here, yet the stairs aren\\u2019t safe. Once you get up to the top, you walk a little bit and look straight down. There are vertical steps - so not stairs on an incline, but vertical, which is really dangerous, especially in this kind of wind. The water current is one big current and it looks like it\\u2019s muddy and murky because it moves so fast all the time, so all of this stuff from the bottom of the river is stirred up, so you can\\u2019t see through it at all. There\\u2019s other bits of debris, like logs and twigs and other natural items from the earth. I can see a few people way down there. They're just looking at the stairs but not moving. I\\u2019m supposed to climb back down these vertical stairs. I\\u2019m trying, but at this point, my son comes into my room and shouts at me. That\\u2019s enough of a jolt that I\\u2019m able to get up and move my body.\"],[\"\\u201cMacro-Level Choices\\u201d This dream begins where I am part of this diagram, so I\\u2019m watching what feels like a macro-level perspective of different groups of people\\u2019s food choices. What I see with my eyes is a big bluish grey, but not a chart...it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m inside the chart. I realize I'm looking at patterns of people at an anthropological level from around the world and the choices that they make in food. I\\u2019m watching them like small dots. I\\u2019m wondering what this is. I look at them and study them for long enough. They\\u2019re moving. I see almost like an arc, a pendulum, that swings from the cluster of dots of choices they make, and I\\u2019m not even sure that they\\u2019re all food related - I don\\u2019t think they are. They\\u2019re clustering. Then one of the dots will swing out like a pendulum, then pause. It\\u2019s moved into this other category of things that they\\u2019ve learned. The learning is an evolutionary succession. In the dream, I seem to understand the macro-level implications of this without needing to know the exact words or categories of each choice. My thinking brain is in wonderment at realizing what all these small clusters of activity arrive at - like an aha! Then I move from realizing that some of them are food choices. The dreams shifts from a macro-level to what is happening right now on the earth. Then I arrive in a restaurant. I\\u2019m looking at people\\u2019s food choices. It starts at a table with a woman I haven\\u2019t seen in a long time - Margie is one of my daughter\\u2019s friend\\u2019s mothers. I haven\\u2019t seen her since my daughter was in Grade 8 because the kids ended up going to different high schools. Margie sits down and makes some kind of comment like, \\u201cI thought we were friends, but you never contacted.\\u201d I express surprise at this and say, \\u201cYes, I live over here now and work every evening as well as in the day. I don\\u2019t have time for that kind of thing.\\u201d She seems to feel amenable to that explanation and starts talking to me about her family. As she\\u2019s talking, this other young lad, maybe 17, is hovering around the table and moving things. He\\u2019s getting his backpack and he\\u2019s putting things in it. Then he slides into the role of server and is cleaning some of the plates away. Only Margie\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s plate is left. Now I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s some kind of older step brother and wonder if she has remarried since I knew her. But I look at the young man and he has some features that look like Margie\\u2019s husband. So now I\\u2019m wondering if this young man is maybe a child of the previous marriage of the husband, which means they could still be together and I\\u2019m just seeing this man grown up. Then the scene shifts from the table in a restaurant. I\\u2019m now in the kitchen in their house. People are packing up and clearing away dishes from the table, still. Margie has asked me if I\\u2019ll come over for tea. I agree to do this. My own son has somehow been invited to go back and forth from my house to hers, which is actually something she would do - organize families on this slightly macro-level as dinner is going on because she is an accountant. He\\u2019s now only 7 and he has a scooter. There's the question of how he will get his things from my house to hers on this scooter. I tell him to try it right now: \\u201cPut all the things you have with you in a bag and we\\u2019ll weigh it. Is it too heavy to swing from one handle of the scooter?\\u201d It is. It will pull him off balance a bit. So I say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we roll the bag and I\\u2019ll bungee cord it to the back of the scooter. No one uses that space anyway. Then it will keep the mechanics more balanced.\\u201d Margie says, \\u201cOh yes! That\\u2019s a really good idea!\\u201d My son is now on the road and he gives it a couple tries up and down and says, \\u201cYes, it works.\\u201d Now I'm back in the kitchen - in the thought of the kitchen. The dream is shifting me through thought patterns. The young man is now ready to go and he hasn\\u2019t said anything I ask him if he needs a ride because he seems to be hovering. I ask him how he\\u2019s going to move from Place A to Place B. He declines the ride. Now, the dream pattern shifts and I\\u2019m in a restaurant and serving tables, moving food from underneath the heat lamp where it\\u2019s cooked in the kitchen out to the tables - I\\u2019m coordinating that. It tells you where to go because it has the name of the server on the paper beside the food as well as the table number. So I just do this for a little bit. Then my shift is over and I\\u2019m sitting in the breakroom counting up money and adding that up when one of the cooks comes in from the kitchen and says, \\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\\u201d I realize I\\u2019m not on the schedule for next week and the rest of the staff seem to know this and are questioning why this has happened. Each person, there\\u2019s probably 5 or 6 people who come into contact with me and tell me they\\u2019re surprised by this, and that I was doing a new job, and they are sorry to see me go, and then some questions about how they\\u2019ll keep in touch with me. I\\u2019m wondering, thinking, \\u201cOh so it\\u2019s not just me not knowing why I\\u2019ve been let go.\\u201d I decide after all of this to go into the office to see if I can ask why. I\\u2019m looking for closure. The part of the administration that\\u2019s responsible for scheduling doesn\\u2019t know the answer to that question and evades me when I ask direct questions, but doesn\\u2019t seem hostile. There\\u2019s the energy of feeling that person doesn\\u2019t know why they\\u2019ve been requested to do that either. So, I leave, put everything in my pack, make sure I\\u2019ve left nothing behind, and say final goodbyes. And here\\u2019s this young man again from the other thought pattern - the guy that might possibly be Margie\\u2019s stepson. He\\u2019s leaving at the same time, but now he\\u2019s asking me if I need a ride. I say, \\u201cNo thank you. I\\u2019ve got a car in the parking lot.\\u201d So I walk out with my things and put them in the car. I notice he\\u2019s putting his things in a red car. When he leaves, it\\u2019s really noisy. Then I get in mine. Now there\\u2019s snow on the ground. I\\u2019m testing my brakes. The brakes aren\\u2019t where they should be. So I gear down to navigate my car out of the parking lot because I have to make a right hand turn. Gearing down works and gives me a little extra time to figure out where the brake pedal has been moved to. It\\u2019s weight over on the left in a really odd place, where the clutch would be. But I\\u2019ve got it now. I have to make another right hand turn. Suddenly there\\u2019s a bus. The whole left hand lane is stopped, so I go even further left to go around. It\\u2019s okay even though my tires don\\u2019t really have traction in the snow. Now I'm driving through a city. I start job hunting. I stop at a few restaurants on my way home after applying to three different restaurants. They all say they don\\u2019t need anyone. Now I\\u2019ve driven to the complete opposite end of town and am back in the house where I would meet Margie for tea.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arms Dealer\\u201d This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he\\u2019s not there to buy books. I realize I\\u2019m not in my own body because I see my arm and it\\u2019s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that\\u2019s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can\\u2019t see the other two names, but that\\u2019s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that\\u2019s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That\\u2019s the point I realize they\\u2019ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he\\u2019s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, \\u201cOkay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?\\u201d They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, \\u201cEh, shouldn\\u2019t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren\\u2019t we not supposed to jostle this material or there\\u2019s the danger of it exploding?\\u201d Man consciousness me says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d The part of my own consciousness that\\u2019s trapped in there says, \\u201cYou have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can\\u2019t have any cough. It\\u2019s not supposed to be jostled once.\\u201d I feel frustrated inside this guy\\u2019s consciousness. Then, he has a few things that he\\u2019s gathered and puts his arms around them and carries them. It feels like the way it would feel as though you were carrying two bags of groceries with loaves of bread in them with one tucked under each arm. I compare it to this. Then he walks up the alleyway and into his house. I notice that the house is really overcrowded and has toys and books and stuff everywhere - belonging to someone who never cleans up. Then he goes into the kitchen and the rack they use in restaurants for putting dishes on and then putting them through an autoclave machine - he sets three loaves of bread on the dish rack and puts them in the oven, but doesn\\u2019t turn it on yet. He\\u2019s still got this dry cough, and I think, \\u201cWow, isn\\u2019t this guy going to take care of that?\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t. Then he sits down at the table, ostensibly to wait while these things do whatever they have to do in the oven. Then the part of the man that\\u2019s my consciousness starts to take over and the man consciousness starts to go away. Now I\\u2019m me and I\\u2019m sitting there looking around at this mess and thinking, \\u201cUgh, I have to start cleaning this up.\\u201d Then across from the table, Omar appears. I tell him, \\u201cWhat is wrong with these people? Why is everybody in denial? There's so many other choices that people make. I don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d He nods his head and agrees, then asks me if it\\u2019s okay if he uses my bicycle from the garage. I say, \\u201cYeah, do you know which one it is?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I think so. It\\u2019s the one your ex-husband\\u2019s been using.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?! What are you talking about? Why would either one of you want to use my bicycle?\\u201d It\\u2019s got the two white bars that go down and purple - it looks like a girl\\u2019s bike. He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it looks like now.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat does it look like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, your husband modified it. It\\u2019s got a motorcycle seat on it. And he took out the hump in the middle, so you can sit upright on it.\\u201d I\\u2019m starting to get riled up because he never asked me if he could do that. Then I look back at Omar and say, \\u201cThis is the problem! He never respects my boundaries and he always does these things without asking first. Do you think it\\u2019s unreasonable that it upsets me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo that is a normal thing.\\u201d Then he makes reference to his ex-wife and he says, \\u201cEven in my marriage, we asked each other for permission.\\u201d Then he starts laughing and he takes a piece of paper and shows me - it\\u2019s written the way you would write out a script in a play with the one person\\u2019s name, then the colon and the line then the other person. There\\u2019s 10 lines of just one-liners. First it\\u2019s him and his ex-wife, him and his ex-wife, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, all the way down. Then one of them throws their hands up in exasperation and says: \\u201cOkay fine!\\u201d So he just hands it to me and I read this. Then he\\u2019s laughing and says, \\u201cWell at least it\\u2019s agreement.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m laughing, too, and say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s better than just taking it without asking, then modifying, then just walking away again, leaving it in the modified form so I can\\u2019t use it anymore.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cAlright, well I have to go to work.\\u201d So I follow him down the hallway. As I\\u2019m passing through the kitchen, I look at the store and think, \\u201cWhy is it at 77 degrees Celsius?!\\u201d I look with alarm and think, \\u201cOh yeah, that\\u2019s from the man consciousness body.\\u201d I see the three loaves of bread in there and they are starting to disintegrate with the heat. It\\u2019s vaporizing the plastic bags, and I think, \\u201cOh, isn\\u2019t that going to melt and cause some trouble in there?\\u201d But the temperature is so high that it just vaporizes. Then I realize I have to leave that there because this is the man consciousness\\u2019 house. But when I get in the hallway and go to say goodbye to Omar, I see two jackets. I realize one is the 4 year old boy, one is the 8 year old boy, and I look at Omar in alarm and say, \\u201cWhat are they doing here in this house?! They\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d But the part of me that is also in the man\\u2019s body sees that they belong to his kids. The consciousness that is me suddenly categorizes the overcrowding of stuff and not tidying up and putting away is from his kids. He\\u2019s making this money and also has this dual role of taking care of his family even though he\\u2019s doing it illegally. At that moment, he\\u2019s simultaneously opening the door and there\\u2019s my own two cats. They get out of the house and start to go up the street which is now a different street. It\\u2019s crowded with people and families. Kids are playing in the snow and it\\u2019s wintertime. Everybody has on snowsuits. There are toboggans and some ice and people are skating. I see my one cat has been interested by a bird. There is a group of people that are around my other cat and they\\u2019re putting snow on him and patting him with the snow and he\\u2019s enjoying it. So I get her first - I catch her just before she leaps into the air to take off after the bird. But I know I can\\u2019t carry them both at the same time. So as I\\u2019m walking back to what is now my own house, I see Kathryn, one of my students, and I ask if she can hold my cat for a moment while I get the other one. She says, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019ll just grab this one.\\u201d And she gets the second cat while I still have my first cat and am putting him back in the house. Then she sets him down for a second while she frolics off and does something else. I just think, \\u201cWhat is wrong with people that they just can\\u2019t follow through?\\u201d Then I put my tiny almost brittle cat back (her spine is uncomfortable when you pick her up and she gets squirmy) in the house and pick up my other one - he\\u2019s much heavier. I can feel his fur and his heavy body and his skin. So now they\\u2019re both back in the house. Everybody is safe and it\\u2019s just my house. My dream ends there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Greenhouse\\u201d This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I\\u2019m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He\\u2019s in a van and he comes out of the van. He\\u2019s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there\\u2019s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can\\u2019t because he can\\u2019t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I\\u2019m draggin him up with me so he can get there. Now it\\u2019s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we\\u2019re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I\\u2019m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it\\u2019s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there\\u2019s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They\\u2019re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They\\u2019re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo! Stop, stop!\\u201d The cat goes backwards, but doesn\\u2019t see where it\\u2019s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I\\u2019m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It\\u2019s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I\\u2019m cradling it in my arms and see that it\\u2019s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The other one is still in there. The cat starts to squirm and wants to get down. The ex comes in and says, \\u201cHow did this mud get in here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, Luke must have tracked it in.\\u201d He glares at me and gets really angry and says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you dare say that name out loud.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? He was here. Didn't you see him outside at the top of the hill?\\u201d Now he\\u2019s really mad at me and tells me I\\u2019m a liar and stop saying that. So I say to him, \\u201cYou didn't see him?\\u201d Then he storms out of the house. Then I remember that Luke told me to get vinegar to pour on it. So I go into the kitchen to get vinegar out from underneath the sink. I pour it on top of the mud that has the maggots and stuff in it. They all die. Then as I\\u2019m cleaning up, the dream deconstructs. I\\u2019m suddenly in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house. I\\u2019m in the process of planting a garden. Their house is huge. It\\u2019s like a mansion down by the shore of the lake. The greenhouse has long raised beds in it and really tall domed windows that arc over the top. They\\u2019re really dirty. There\\u2019s an old garden that looks like it hasn\\u2019t been tended for a while. I leave the greenhouse and walk across the grounds into a shed and find some tools. But as I open the shed door - it\\u2019s creaky and there are cobwebs. I find a hoe and some shears. I take them back to the greenhouse. I start to till and aerate the earth with the hoe. I notice that some of the plants that decayed and died have seeds in them. I\\u2019m making sure that I shake the plant - agitate it a little, so some of the seeds go into the earth as I\\u2019m hoeing. Then a man comes up - I assume he is the gardener. He is wearing a uniform and he questions what I\\u2019m doing. I tell him I am restoring the garden. He starts giving me some instructions. I say, \\u201cDid you used to be the gardener here?\\u201d He says yes. I realize that he\\u2019s also dead. He can\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s instructing me to do. So I listen to him. I ask if he knows where there\\u2019s any vinegar. He says, \\u201cYes, there is some here. I will arrange for it to be delivered to you.\\u201d So I start to till up one side - there are two long raised beds, 30 feet long each. As I till the greyed earth on top, I see there\\u2019s rich black earth underneath. I feel inspired by this task. Then I see that some kind of delivery has appeared. I remember that I also asked him for some balck earth. So there\\u2019s a bag of black earth and some vinegar. There\\u2019re also buckets, cloths and a sponge mop. I think, \\u201cGreat, I can wash these windows so the sun can come through.\\u201d I do that. It looks beautiful. Then on the other side, there\\u2019s a child - I don\\u2019t know who it is. I start showing them how to till up the earth so that seeds can be planted in holes, then how you can make the raised be up around the small plants, then you\\u2019ve got a little line between where water can go and people can walk if needed. So this child is helping me, but I still don\\u2019t know who it is. At the end of the day, I end up with some tall seed flowers in the back, some sustainable things we can eat coming up, as well as some herbs. There\\u2019s soup herbs, soup vegetables, fruit, nuts, pollinator flowers and natural insect repellent flowers. I picked red, yellow, orange and purple flowers. So it\\u2019s going to be a beautiful garden. We\\u2019re not all done, but it\\u2019s just too much to do in one day, so we leave. The child disappears. I\\u2019m walking across the grounds which are quite large. It takes a little bit of time to walk. When I get to the other side, I\\u2019m at the road. I walk up the road. I start to go through the outskirts and through old suburbia with 300 year old trees. I come to a house and realize it\\u2019s a rental. There\\u2019s a bottom floor for rent and top floor for rent. Suddenly a real estate agent appears and is describing when the tenants are leaving. The bottom floor is going to be empty today, the top floor tenants aren\\u2019t going to be leaving for a couple weeks. So she asks if I\\u2019m interested in the bottom floor. Since they are in the process of moving, it\\u2019s okay for us to go in. I really like it. I love the treed lot. There\\u2019s lots of natural shade over the sleeping area. The bedrooms are large and I like how the bedrooms are separated from the activity part of the house. So it will be good for sleeping. The kitchen is nice and big - there\\u2019s enough space for eating and a prep area. So I tell her that I\\u2019ll take it, but I\\u2019m also wanting to put a catio outside of the entry to the backyard so I can put my cats in it and they'll have lots of space to climb and run. Now the current tenant is there. Suddenly he has something I can easily use as a catio. He has a strange creature in it. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog, but as I get closer, I realize it\\u2019s some kind of rodent about the size of a small dog. I think it\\u2019s from South America. He\\u2019s a very sullen man - he doesn\\u2019t look like he wants to talk. I do ask him what kind of pet that is. He doesn\\u2019t answer me. He keeps the same expression on his face. We go back into the house and now I realize that I need roommates for this because there are four bedrooms and I can\\u2019t afford it by myself. There's the question of who will be the roommates. The real estate agent is interviewing some people. Two of them I know there is no way I can live with. One is someone I know and have actually lived with before, and I say, \\u201cYes, that will work. Please interview her.\\u201d Suddenly I\\u2019m moved in and I\\u2019ve been living there for a little while. I have two other roommates. I feel like they came with the house. The one roommate\\u2019s bedroom, when I\\u2019m trying to sleep, they\\u2019re sleeping area moves out like an extending wall in a motorhome. When he goes in to sleep, the bed extends over the feet of my bed and I can\\u2019t stretch my legs out when I'm sleeping. So I don\\u2019t like this arrangement. I contact the real estate agent and say, \\u201cOkay, it\\u2019s been a couple weeks. Are the other tenants getting ready to move out?\\u201d She says yes. So I look at their place. It\\u2019s a little smaller, but I will still be able to keep the catio for my cats. So my dream ends where I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cCan we either ask these two other guys to move out, or is it okay that I just transfer my lease to the other side of the house?\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cLocked Out\\u201d In the dream, I am supposed to teach at the Yoga Studio. I have loaded my car up with the props and driven to the town where the studio is. The town is actually really pretty, like a turn of the century town, probably built around the railroad. There are still remnants of that in the architecture, cobblestone, and gaslights on the street that have been converted to electricity. I meet the staff of the Yoga Studio at the coffee shop across the street. We chat about some upcoming themes. I cross the street with them. I\\u2019ve parked my car behind that building. They unlock the Yoga Studio and we go in to teach. We set up and I teach a yoga class. I come out and a man is sitting there. I don\\u2019t recall him being inthe class. We have a little conversation. I know him from university. One of the other staff comes out and suggests to the owner in front of me that my class was insensitive to someone\\u2019s trauma. The owner lets out a guffaw, because if anything, I\\u2019m known for my sensitivity to that kind of thing. She says, \\u201cWhat do you mean? Can you describe it?\\u201d The other staff member lifts her arms up towards the sky, bends her knees a little bit and says that someone\\u2019s thigh may have touched their belly in that pose. Again, the owner says, \\u201cWell if someone is that sensitive to themselves, then they shouldn\\u2019t be coming to class.\\u201d Meanwhile, I haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m surprised that things have gotten this far where sensitivities are so cloistered that they can\\u2019t even be in a yoga class and we keep changing the world to adjust to that level of sensitivity. I\\u2019m kind of mulling that around in my mind thinking, \\u201cIs there any way to make the class more trauma-aware to body touching? Or has this gone too far?\\u201d So I\\u2019m thinking about this as everybody gathers up their things and leaves the building. By now, it\\u2019s nighttime. The owners lock the door and get in their car. Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my keys. I cross the street quickly and am yelling their names. I realize there are three cars with people in them and none are the owners, although I didn\\u2019t see them drive away. So I can\\u2019t get back into the studio to get my keys. I cross back the street again, which incidentally has a lovely median with a beautiful garden of flowers you can see in the dark. Now there are Parisienne cafe tables that only fit an espresso cup and saucer - maybe three or four, with people sitting there. I am hesitant to say anything to them. But I don't know what I\\u2019m going to do. I have no way to get in my car. I have no way to get home. It\\u2019s dark. I don't have my wallet. I don\\u2019t have my purse. I don\\u2019t have my cell phone. So I know the studio is not going to open until morning. I don\\u2019t know the studio owners\\u2019 phone numbers by heart. But this one man turns around and says to me, \\u201cUm, are you locked out?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, I am. Sorry to trouble you, but I\\u2019m wondering if it\\u2019s okay if I use somebody\\u2019s phone?\\u201d I need to look up a number. The woman sitting in front of me - she\\u2019s probably a 20-year-old girl - hands me her cell phone. As I take it into my hand, I notice the buttons are plastic and raised. Even the action of bringing my finger from the bottom to the top sets off this string of numbers on the screen and I don't know how to erase that and I\\u2019ve never seen a cell phone keypad like this. The man beside me reaches over and corrects it for me. Then I dial 911, but every time I touch it, it enters four nines, and eight ones. I mimic what he did - I run my finger up from the bottom to the top and it goes away. I try it three or four times, and it\\u2019s so sensitive no matter how lightly I touch it. Then I realize, \\u201cOh! Wait a minute. 911 is emergency. I need 411.\\u201d So when I punch in 411 lightly it goes in immediately. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s some kind of resistance to the phone to having 911 dialed for it. How interesting is that?\\u201d The 411 goes to some kind of opening where you have to speak and say the name, and it will automatically pull up numbers. So I do this and say the studio owner\\u2019s name. Then a screen pops up and I have to move my finger along the sliding scale for the distance I want covered as they search this name; otherwise, 9,000 versions will come up. So I do that. I slide the ruler around. I find the border of the town where I think she lives and I slide the ruler there. It comes up with 20 numbers. I have no idea which one is hers. I get discouraged. I tell the woman, \\u201cThank you, but here is your phone.\\u201d So now I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to sleep. I know she lives close to the studio. She hasn't asked me if I need anything else yet. I stand there and then start to go up the street. All of a sudden, she\\u2019s in front of me. I see that she goes up an alleyway. I don\\u2019t follow her. I don\\u2019t see where she goes. I wait a few minutes. I\\u2019m in a parking lot behind the stores.There are only two levels of this building - the store on the bottom level and the apartments on the top. I choose one balcony. I think it\\u2019s hers because I know she has a cat and it looks like a cat would live there. There are some boxes piled up around. I climb into one of these boxes and think I\\u2019ll just stay here for the night. It\\u2019s not that cold out. Then, my dream shifts for a moment. That same staff member that said my classes weren\\u2019t sensitive to body-touch - it\\u2019s morning and she\\u2019s also sleeping in a box. We start to have a conversation when I look over and see three balconies down, a man hanging onto a blanket and another man trying to pull him up. The first man looks like he\\u2019s still asleep. As I stand up, I notice we\\u2019re not just one floor up from the ground, we\\u2019re 60! I get this big sense of vertigo and I can\\u2019t balance on my feet. It\\u2019s snowing out. His eyes and lips are blue and he either looks dead or frozen as though he\\u2019s stayed out all night long. The other man is pulling him up. The first man\\u2019s hand is stuck to the blanket and the other man is pulling him up. Now she runs out through the apartment, which is now hers, ostensibly to go down the hall to bang on the front door and ask if they need any help. But very quickly, the first man pulls him up and over. I think I should go tell her, but I don't because I realize by the time I get there, she\\u2019ll already know this information So I just wait till she comes back. Then the scene shifts back again. It\\u2019s just me outside this other young girl\\u2019s apartment. The balcony door is open now. I can see into her kitchen, which is really messy. There\\u2019s a washing machine and dryer, as well as a sink. It's very tiny. There\\u2019s laundry on the floor and things that haven't been put away on top of the counters. The cat comes in and I see it. It\\u2019s trying to climb up this stack of things because there\\u2019s a food bag up there. It\\u2019s going to feed itself. But as it is climbing up this stack of parcels and dirty laundry, the pile collapses and the cat slides down. I am just standing there, amused by this, watching the cat navigate through when she comes through the door to pick the kitty up. She sees me and says, \\u201cHave you been out there all night?\\u201d I say yes. She says, \\u201cOh come on in, you don\\u2019t have to stand out there.\\u201d So I come in and ask if I can use the washroom. She says yes. Then the scene flips and it\\u2019s like a replay, only I'm outside and her house is this little tiny house in the middle of the desert. There are men on camels and they\\u2019re fighting and having some kind of war. Now both of us, the girl and I , are trying to race towards her house for safety before one of these warring guys hits us with whatever they\\u2019re throwing at each other. We do and now we\\u2019re back inside. Inside the house, I look down and think I\\u2019m okay to teach wearing this. I have stretchy capris underneath a wrap around sarong. My shirt will do and I have a jean jacket on top. I think, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019m good to go. I can teach my morning class. I\\u2019ll find my keys in the studio, then return home and all this will be just fine.\\u201d The girl and I leave. She\\u2019s going to the morning yoga class anyway. We return to the studio. As we\\u2019re walking, I imagine that I see my keys on the studio counter. But I don't actually enter into the studio. My dream ends there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Board Meeting\\u201d In this dream, I am in a townhouse complex. It opens and I\\u2019m having a day to myself where I realize I can do whatever I want. I\\u2019ve decided I\\u2019m just going to play my guitar. I get my guitar out and am setting it up. I see out my window that my stepmother is leaving. Through the window, although I can\\u2019t hear her voice, she tells me that she\\u2019s told the board of directors that I\\u2019m going to take her place for the day and be the secretary and record her notes. I\\u2019m annoyed and then she\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t even have time to tell her this is my only day to myself and I didn\\u2019t even agree to this. Now instead of having the day, the board of directors is filing into my house. I notice that they\\u2019re the seniors from the day at the whaling place when they were just there as onlookers at this whaling equipment and remarking over it. This also annoys me. The meeting starts and they\\u2019re talking about things. As I\\u2019m recording this, I\\u2019m noticing that no one is really sharing the conversation. No decision is being made. They\\u2019re just talking about everything. They move from one thing to another and it\\u2019s taking an extraordinary long period of time and it\\u2019s unproductive. I start doodling on my page and not really recording anything. Then they get to a conversation where someone has brought up that they smell marijuana in the complex. I think to myself, \\u201cWell, of course you do. It\\u2019s legal in Canada now.\\u201dThey\\u2019re talking about the smell. They don\\u2019t like walking through smells. I think to myself, \\u201cyeah, I\\u2019ve smelled it for about half a second when I\\u2019ve been in a canoe on the water and no one else is around. I\\u2019ve smelled it for another half a second when I\\u2019m walking on a sidewalk to the grocery store.\\u201d So the clouds of smoke from somebody\\u2019s house half a mile away have drifted around like other smells do from the kitchen and people\\u2019s bathrooms. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much longer are they going to go on talking about the smell and they can\\u2019t even do anything about it. This meeting is unproductive.\\u201d So I set down the pad of paper I\\u2019m writing on and I wander off to a different area of the room. I actually get my guitar out again and wonder if they can hear me. I start tuning it very quietly and no one says anything. Then I start playing a song. Then I hear on the agenda that they\\u2019re talking about someone who has asked for a refund of $26.57 for something the board processed that they shouldn\\u2019t have. I think, \\u201cOh, that was me! That was years and years ago. I\\u2019d forgotten about that.\\u201d So I set my guitar down and go back to the table. I\\u2019m listening to the process of their conversation and wondering if they just talk about this at every meeting for three years and never get it off their list? I wonder if they\\u2019re going to get it off their list this time. I don\\u2019t even care about it now and it\\u2019s a small amount. I\\u2019d forgotten about what it was for and as I\\u2019m listening to the conversation, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh yeah, they shouldn\\u2019t have charged me for that. So one of the men that was on the whaling excursion, he's sayinsaucerg that she\\u2019s right and they should reimburse her the money. He doesn\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s me. Someone else from the board says, \\u201cWell, where will the money come from?\\u201d I mentally roll my eyes and think, \\u201cGeez, they don\\u2019t even have a treasurer.\\u201d Then someone else says, \\u201cWe need to put in a request for that.\\u201d Then I just wander away from the table again, thinking, \\u201cWow, they will never get anything done. Maybe they\\u2019re just here because there\\u2019s nothing else for them to do.\\u201d I go back to my guitar.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Swan Costume\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m in Spain, I think. It\\u2019s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I\\u2019m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it\\u2019s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He\\u2019s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that\\u2019s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I\\u2019m in a different country. I'm a different person. I\\u2019m in a kitchen scene where I\\u2019m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there\\u2019s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I\\u2019m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I\\u2019m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I\\u2019m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It\\u2019s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s kind of interesting.\\u201d I look at it. I have the plant in the other hand. I think, \\u201cHmm, now the seeds from the plant are gone.\\u201d I\\u2019m moving the slats on the shudder in a cupboard and it\\u2019s chafed the seeds out and collected them. So I close the cupboard board and put the bare plant on the counter. I turn around and now there are more dishes on the island. My sibling is doing nothing. I speak sharply to him. I refresh the water in the sink and put the plug back in. I notice that there\\u2019s 4 inches of unwashed cutlery in the bottom that he's been pretending to do. I speak sharply to him about that. Then I do some of it myself, but am thinking that if I keep doing this myself, he\\u2019s never going to learn to do it. So I put fresh water in then turn the tap off and tell him he needs to do his work if he\\u2019s ever going to get out of the area. I go back and finish my own. I\\u2019m disgusted in the dream by the sludge in the bottom of the sink and the pile of food bits and organic waste in the plug that I have to pluck out and dump. The dream flips back to the other scene where I\\u2019m in this palazzo in Spain. Now, the day has progressed and it\\u2019s almost nighttime. My father\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t know where he is. I\\u2019m suddenly supposed to be helping these people find costumes for a masquerade. They come in and I\\u2019m at the end of the palazzo. There\\u2019s a really long bar of clothing hanging from it. People are coming in one at a time, saying what they want to look like. I go through the clothes hanging from the bar and I hand them one and they just walk away with it. It\\u2019s not a line up and not a popular thing. I start to look through the clothing. I become absorbed by the feel of the material. The satins are really dark, the black is really inky and they feel smooth under my fingers. Then this woman comes up. She says, \\u201cDo I have something that will make her have a more shapely butt?\\u201d I think, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I start looking through the clothing and I find something. She says, \\u201cHow do I use this?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m wearing black gloves. As I\\u2019m looking through, the knowledge comes to me and I say, \\u201cYou put this part on and it pushes your low back down into your butt, which loosens the skin a bit. Then you put this part on and it pushes from the hamstrings up to fill it.\\u201d Then I warn her that it says on the tag to be very careful because this can be hard or dangerous for your low back. Then there\\u2019s a costumed part that goes around the upper body. It kind of looks like a man\\u2019s lapel from a suit. So she takes it anyway and walks away. Then I\\u2019m concerned about this. I go to try and find the mother - she\\u2019s not my mother, she\\u2019s just another part of the family that works there. I tell her that someone just wanted that costume. She doesn\\u2019t reply to my question. She says, \\u201cI have something I think you would really like. Wait here for a second.\\u201d She goes and gets it. It\\u2019s white. She says, \\u201cHere, feel this.\\u201d I feel it and it\\u2019s got form to it. It\\u2019s white. There\\u2019s a feathery feel, like the way feathers would feel on a white bird if you just ran your hand over the top of its head and down towards the back with the grain of the feathers. It\\u2019s not stretchy material. It has form to it like a ballet dancer\\u2019s costume. She says to go try it on. As I do this, I see her nephew come in. He\\u2019s a man. He sees me holding that in my hand. Then he looks down. I feel there\\u2019s some kind of disapproval and also some attraction in his eyes. I go into the bathroom and put it on. I make sure I go into the small bathroom only made for only one person because I don\\u2019t want anyone else to see me in this, but I do want to see what it looks like. It has a full length mirror in it. So I put it on. I like the way it contrasts with my brown skin. It feels really nice when I put it on. It has a little bit of weight to it. When I turn around and look in the back, first I notice there\\u2019s a bikini line on my body which is at odds with the line of the costume. The back of the costume comes up like a thong and there\\u2019s a big scooped part that goes up over my hips from the leg. Because it\\u2019s got form to it, it doesn\\u2019t sit on my body - it doesn\\u2019t cling to it. It moves a little bit when I move. I\\u2019m slightly concerned about this because it\\u2019s a bit big for me. But I turn around and it\\u2019s also got these four other pieces that are about maybe 8 inches long, curved gently like an \\u201cS\\u201d the way the downstruck in treble clef goes. They\\u2019re also white and they\\u2019ve got downy feathers around the top. I realize they\\u2019re to frame my eyes. They tuck in with little straps at the top of the costume quite nicely and stay there. So the one curved in sits on the top of the shoulder and it goes up the side of my neck and then curves again gently underneath my eyes towards the inside of my nose. There are two on each side - one goes to the inside of the eye, one goes to the outside of the eye. I actually really like these and I spend a few moments admiring the craftsmanship , the velvety feel of them and the way they fit over the top of the shoulders. I like how they feel around the outside of my eyes. They kind of hide the eyes, too, because it\\u2019s like a masquerade. Then I turn around because I\\u2019m concerned that the costume moves a little bit of its own accord when I\\u2019m walking. Now I notice I\\u2019ve got these really high white heels on. I\\u2019m wishing there was some carpeting on the floor because they\\u2019re quite slippery against the painted stucco and that makes me feel a little nervous. But as I turn around and check out the back again, I bend over a little and think I can't bend over in this and have anyone see me because you can see more of my anatomy than I want roving eyes to be looking at. But as I do this, I feel myself turned on. I feel that move from my body as I look back at the front view in the mirror, I feel heat between my legs and a warmth in my yoni that\\u2019s spreading outwards. I can feel the beginnings of an orgasm and this wakes me up.\"],[\"\\u201cGetting Ready to Cast Off\\u201d I\\u2019m on my friend Lynn\\u2019s sailboat. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We\\u2019re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I\\u2019ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I\\u2019m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we\\u2019re waiting because the wind has died down. We\\u2019re waiting for the wind to pick up. There\\u2019s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It\\u2019s really silly. I\\u2019m on this dinghy and it\\u2019s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I\\u2019m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I\\u2019m hanging on to the mast and sail. It\\u2019s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I\\u2019m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, \\u201cHmm, I could actually fall asleep here.\\u201d I\\u2019m in danger of doing so. I think, \\u201cWell, I better not fall asleep.\\u201d So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, \\u201cWell, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.\\u201d I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I\\u2019m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I\\u2019m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it\\u2019s not in the dreamscape anymore. I\\u2019m swinging around on this rope. I\\u2019m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I\\u2019m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I\\u2019m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I\\u2019ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn\\u2019t get tangled on anything. Now I\\u2019m wondering what else I\\u2019m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they\\u2019ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, \\u201cOh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I\\u2019ll paint rocks.\\u201d So all of a sudden, there\\u2019s another person who I actually work with, though I\\u2019ve never sailed with her - I don\\u2019t think she sails. She\\u2019s been invited to go on the boat. I\\u2019m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she\\u2019s doing to pass the time and she\\u2019s painting rocks. I think, \\u201cWell this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she\\u2019s used.\\u201d I kind of go up tentatively because I don\\u2019t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, \\u201cWhat kind of paint are you using for that?\\u201d She tells me that it\\u2019s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, \\u201cNo, I just came back from Michael\\u2019s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they\\u2019re doing something that\\u2019s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.\\u201d So I ask her where it is and she says, \\u201cHere, it\\u2019s on this map and it\\u2019s marked with an X so that we don\\u2019t go there.\\u201d I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don\\u2019t want Lynn to know I\\u2019ve gone to Michael\\u2019s as well because she\\u2019ll be upset. So I think, \\u201cI\\u2019ll just go to the Dollar Store.\\u201d As I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store, I don\\u2019t have any shoes. I\\u2019m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they\\u2019re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I\\u2019ve got a bag. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I\\u2019ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It\\u2019s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we\\u2019re going to cat off. But we don\\u2019t! It\\u2019s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she\\u2019s been sewing something. She asks me if I\\u2019d like to make something. I say, \\u201cWell, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you\\u2019re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it\\u2019s very cooling. So I\\u2019ll make one of those.\\u201d So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That\\u2019s the end of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cSpirit People\\u201d I\\u2019m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they\\u2019re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We\\u2019re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don\\u2019t say anything. I\\u2019m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it\\u2019s on the top floor. She says, \\u201cThis is where we\\u2019re supposed to go - my contact is up here.\\u201d We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we\\u2019re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we\\u2019re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I\\u2019m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, \\u201cWait here. I\\u2019ll be back in a moment.\\u201d So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.\\u201d The first yoga class is all the bride\\u2019s family. They\\u2019re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that\\u2019s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I\\u2019m figuring there\\u2019s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they\\u2019re serving food. They\\u2019re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren\\u2019t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I\\u2019m suggesting we leave. But they\\u2019re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they\\u2019re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person\\u2019s hair. I look and it\\u2019s someone I recognize. I didn\\u2019t know her very well, though, and I hadn\\u2019t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I\\u2019d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I\\u2019m hugging her and saying, \\u201cWow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so very long,\\u201d I realize in my dream mind that she\\u2019s dead. We don\\u2019t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I\\u2019m seeing more people that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there\\u2019s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don\\u2019t know her - we don\\u2019t have any close conversations. She\\u2019s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, \\u201cOh, that can\\u2019t be good and why don\\u2019t you say something...you\\u2019re passive to this?\\u201d Then her son comes up. I just know it\\u2019s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: \\u201cI can tell whose son this is!\\u201d I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, \\u201cAlright, it\\u2019s time to go. We don\\u2019t have anything to do here.\\u201d So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re just gone. I look down and I\\u2019ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they\\u2019re attached. I think, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t mine.\\u201d I know where it\\u2019s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, \\u201cHey, I think this is yours.\\u201d He looks at it and says, \\u201cOh, I haven\\u2019t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.\\u201d I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I\\u2019m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can\\u2019t accept it until I\\u2019ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I\\u2019m waiting and it looks like he\\u2019s going to disappear back into the store and I\\u2019ve still got this pot I\\u2019m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it\\u2019s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I\\u2019m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I\\u2019m walking into Mandy\\u2019s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it\\u2019s been there for ages. There\\u2019s another pair over by the sink. There\\u2019s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I\\u2019m just hearing the voice and deduce that it\\u2019s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It\\u2019s covered with seran wrap. It\\u2019s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, \\u201cOh, she\\u2019s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!\\u201d So, I ask her if she\\u2019d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there\\u2019s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it\\u2019s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He\\u2019s got hair like Mo from the \\u201cThree Stooges\\u201d but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it\\u2019s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he\\u2019s dead and she\\u2019s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I\\u2019m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there\\u2019s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I\\u2019m wearing my own wedding dress. He\\u2019s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He\\u2019s talking to me about something and I don\\u2019t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we\\u2019re in our bedroom and making love.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Road Trip\\u201d This dream begins with me in a car. My lover is in the backseat and a mutual friend is driving. We\\u2019re about to embark on a road trip. We drive by my kids\\u2019 school first. I want to check and make sure that they both leave and are on their way home to where they will be taken care of. So as we drive by, first I see my son. I wave to him. He waves back and walks in the direction of home. I know he\\u2019ll be fine. Then I see a whole lot of other kids - you know how kids at dismissal time come out in a pack, there may be a few stragglers at first and a few stragglers after the bulk of kids leaving. So we drive slowly. The bulk of kids is gone. I say, \\u201cHang on, I haven\\u2019t seen my daughter yet.\\u201d A few more kids come out of the school, then I see her. I wave and she waves me over. So I get out of the car and walk over right to her. She says, \\u201cMom, I have something you\\u2019ll need.\\u201d She hands me this really long sanitary napkin that has a tail at each end. She says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to need this.\\u201d Then I realize I do need it. But I don't know how to attach it to my body. I go into the school bathroom and I put it inside my underwear. But these tails are so long and I\\u2019m trying to fold them in so they don\\u2019t stick out. I\\u2019m worried it\\u2019s going to travel. It feels uncomfortable and bulky between my legs, and I don\\u2019t like it. However, it needs to collect blood and I feel myself bleeding. I walk back out thes school, give her a hug and she goes in the same direction as my son. I get into the car. Now I\\u2019m uncomfortable and some of the excitement of the road trip has been replaced by the anxiety of this uncomfortable, bulky and insecure thing between my legs. However, I continue on down through the road. The scenery is flat. You can see a lot - miles and miles of flat. There\\u2019s a little bit of steppe at the horizon. We drive for a long period of time until we run out of gas. We pull into a gas station. While my friends are tending to the car, I go into the washroom. I check to make sure that this napkin is still where it\\u2019s supposed to be and it is. I\\u2019m still concerned about these tails. Now I\\u2019m wearing overalls and the back part goes way down past my waist. I look in the mirror and I can see the top bit of my underwear sticking up. I think to myself,\\u201dWow, my underwear is really high today. Or is this going down really low?\\u201d I\\u2019m not really minding that, except that I\\u2019m worried about these tails. So I reach in behind and I tuck them down in again and I want to make sure that no one can see them. I get back into the car and we are driving again. The flat landscape starts to turn into what looks like a town. My friend, the driver, says, \\u201cWe\\u2019re almost at the theatre.\\u201d So we take a few more turns, get deeper into the town with more city scape. It\\u2019s quite old. The architecture, although I\\u2019ve never been there, looks Austrian - like a Hapsburg theatre would\\u2019ve looked like. It\\u2019s beautiful, intricate architecture. We park the car and walk in. The theatre has a giant arched doorway and as soon as you walk in, it\\u2019s got a hush where the soundproofing is perfect - you can\\u2019t hear any of the outside world. We walk down the carpet and we sit in the seats. I can feel the springs are perfectly loaded to absorb some of your body and they\\u2019re all cushioned so you don\\u2019t feel the spring itself. It just feels like you\\u2019re sinking into this hushed luxury. It\\u2019s a play. I don\\u2019t see any of the play in my dream. As soon as it\\u2019s supposed to start - the orchestra hasn\\u2019t even started yet - the dream shifts. The play is over. We\\u2019re instantly back in the car. Now I want them to stop at a gas station again because I need a different way of collecting the blood. They oblige. I don't tell them what for, I just ask them to stop at a certain place. I go in and I collect something that\\u2019s much more suited to my needs, go back into the washroom and get rid of the thing in the compartment designated for this kind of waste material. I put on something a lot more sleek and comfortable for me and securely attached. I get back in the car and we drive back through this same landscape. The driver drops my lover and I off at my door of my house. I go in. My son has fallen asleep in the living room on the couch. My daughter is upstairs in her room. So, my lover and I sit on the other couch. He falls asleep instantly. I have a cat now on my lap and am cat-paralyzed. I think, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s nothing to do here for a moment, so I\\u2019m going to look and see if there\\u2019s anything on tv.\\u201d I look down and there\\u2019s two things that interest me. One is a show about aliens, but history. Another is about this magical realm. The title is in Spanish: Tiende. I choose one of them - I think it\\u2019s the Tiende one - and I turn on the tv and I watch for a little bit. But now I'm getting uncomfortable because I don\\u2019t want to keep sitting still. The cat jumps off my lap. I get up, go back into the washroom, wash myself, and tend to my physical needs. I\\u2019m still bleeding, so I tend to that. I go back to the couch and sit down. My lover stirs a little bit and he reaches for me and pulls me over. We engage in a long deeply passionate but slow kiss. I can feel how sleepy he is and I\\u2019m starting to get tired. So the kiss completes itself with some kind of acknowledgement that there is mutual sleep to follow. I go upstairs. He\\u2019s back asleep on the couch. I get into bed and then wonder if he\\u2019s going to get cold when he wakes up. There\\u2019s no blanket down there. So I go into the spare room, get one of the blankets to cover him with it. When I go back downstairs, he has removed all his clothing. I cover him up. He says to me, in Spanish, now that I have come down with a blanket he has taken his clothes off. He says, \\u201cComo?\\u201d Then he falls back to sleep. I go back upstairs and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Beach Apartment\\u201d This dream starts out after something has happened and I have to go back and do this again, but I\\u2019m resistant to it throughout the whole dream. I\\u2019m having to go back to the beaches around Lake Ontario and I\\u2019m looking for an apartment. The apartment I\\u2019ve heard about belongs to someone who used to be a neighbor three doors down and I knew him from when I lived there before. I\\u2019ve heard that he has a basement apartment for rent. I make an appointment to go look at it and I walk in and am sent by his mother down into the basement. The basement is grungy. Immediately I don\\u2019t like it. It feels dirty and old. The apartment isn\\u2019t even an apartment - it\\u2019s one long room in the basement. The other two rooms have their things in them - for the grandkids. One says Crayon Room and the other room has extra tables and accessories for crayons. I\\u2019m not sure if the owner of the house is the mom or the son. The son\\u2019s got stuff in a third room. These rooms are all around the periphery. The center of the basement is open - not made into anything - and just has the laundry tubs in it, which are the older kind made of cement. He\\u2019s down there. He says, \\u201cSo, what do you think?\\u201d I tell him that it\\u2019s too small, there\\u2019s only one room, I won\\u2019t be able to fit anything other than my bedroom stuff in it and I need a place for my kitchen table and a place to cook. And what if I have other friends over to study? There\\u2019s no place for us to go. It\\u2019s too small. At this point, he seems offended. I get the sense that he wants me to take the basement apartment, not just to be a renter, but he has a crush on me and it bugs me that he has an ulterior motive and it also isn\\u2019t even really a basement apartment. But that doesn't sway my opinion. I have my bag with me at the appointment looking at the basement apartment. The son engages me in conversation after I refused the apartment. He keeps talking and talking and talking and he won\\u2019t stop talking - the kind of talking where there is no pause between sentences. I realize that I\\u2019m going to be late for work. I\\u2019m waiting for him just to pause and take a breath so I can say, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry I have to go. I have a shift that starts in 45 minutes.\\u201d I\\u2019m getting worried because it takes half an hour to get there and I\\u2019m not ready. He keeps talking! Finally my agitation and anxiety about being late for work is enough that I burst in mid-sentence of his and say, \\u201cLook, I have to go, I\\u2019m going to be late for work! Is it okay if I use your washroom? I need to change.\\u201d He says, no! I think, \\u201cWow, he\\u2019s just doing this because he\\u2019s offended I won\\u2019t take the apartment.\\u201d I go back upstairs, say a couple of polite greeting words to the mom, then leave. I\\u2019m walking up the street. The beach area hasn\\u2019t changed much since I lived there. I\\u2019m wondering where I can go to change into my clothes for my shift. I see a place that\\u2019s familiar. I go in that door and it\\u2019s a house that doesn\\u2019t really belong to anyone - you\\u2019re allowed to go in and change. It\\u2019s maybe a public bathroom - there are a few along the beaches where you can just go in and shower and change. I think it must be one of those because it looks like it from the outside, but on the inside it looks like somebody\\u2019s house. I don\\u2019t know the owner. However, I go in, take a shower, quick quick quick. I don\\u2019t wash my hair, I just braid it before I go into the shower, pin it up, go in and wash my body. I come back out, towel off. This is great, it\\u2019s only taken 5 minutes and now I can brush my teeth at the sink and put on my clothes for my shift - just a pair of black jeans and the shirt that belongs to the pub and it has their logo on it. I\\u2019ve got my apron in the bag. Everything I need is there. As I\\u2019m brushing my teeth, then applying just a little eye makeup, two of the other servers, Carol and Anne, come in and are doing the same thing. They\\u2019re using the other mirrors in the bathroom. They\\u2019re quickly fixing themselves up. I realize we\\u2019ll all be driving to the pub together because we\\u2019re working the same shift. There\\u2019s another person in there, she\\u2019s a hostess, doing the same thing getting ready. Now I say to them, \\u201cSo has it been busy recently?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself that we\\u2019re rushing around, scrambling for the shift and I hope I\\u2019m not going to stand around all night. They say, \\u201cYes, it has been super busy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cGood that means I\\u2019ll make lots of money.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that the owner is going to force me to stand at the hostess stand because I haven\\u2019t been there in a while or worked shifts in a couple of years and he\\u2019s like that. But I\\u2019m scheduled for a waitress shift. They say, \\u201cNo, it should be busy enough that you don\\u2019t have to worry about that.\\u201d Then the other person says, \\u201cHey, I\\u2019m the hostess!\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, you applied to be hostess. That\\u2019s the job you agreed to do. I applied to be a waitress. That\\u2019s the job I agreed to do. It\\u2019s not right that he forces waitresses to do hostess shifts on a whim.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking in my head that if he does that, I\\u2019m just going to quit and won\\u2019t let him do that to me. Then, we're at the mirror and I\\u2019m just putting a little eyeliner on and it\\u2019s not working out. Every time I try to run the tiny brush down underneath my bottom eyelashes, it goes on my cheek which is two inches below that. So I have to wet my finger with the water at the tap, wipe my cheek and try again. I do this about three times, then finally decide just to leave it. But I\\u2019ve already got it on the other eye. When I look in the mirror you can't tell anyway, so I think, \\u201cAlright, it doesn\\u2019t matter.\\u201d Now we\\u2019re all putting our makeup in our little bags and any other stuff we\\u2019ve used to get ready. The scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a basement apartment. In front of me at my grandmother\\u2019s dressing table is a tray from a jewelry store with rows of fake velvet that would display tons and tons of rings - like 50 rings on one tray. I look at it and think, \\u201dEw, this jewelry all looks slightly fake. It doesn\\u2019t look like real gold. It looks like some inferior metal that\\u2019s been dipped in fake gold.\\u201d One of the rings has flowers on it and a band. There's another that\\u2019s white. My stepmother comes over and says, \\u201cOh these are all pretty. Which one are you going to wear?\\u201d I wonder if I have to choose one of these just to not offend her. So I pick up the white one and put it on the middle finger of my left hand. I say, \\u201cOh look, it\\u2019s too big.\\u201d I put it back. Then I\\u2019m taking a really long time to look over all the other ones because I don\\u2019t like any of them. I think, \\u201cUgh, which is the least distasteful?\\u201d Then my younger sister appears beside me and says, \\u201cWhy does Freya get one of those and not me?\\u201d I think, \\u201cWow, can I just give them all to her and then she\\u2019ll stop nagging about it. I don\\u2019t even want them anyway.\\u201d Then my grandmother appears - my maternal grandmother. I\\u2019m happy to see her. She\\u2019s past on. In the dream I know she\\u2019s passed on and I\\u2019m really happy to see her. She says, \\u201cCome with me.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say it out loud because she\\u2019s a spirit, but I just know she wants me to. So I get up from the dressing table and I walk with her. The place we're in has lots of people in it. We walk through the dressing area. Now it looks like the dressing area of a theatre. We sit down on a bench with a cushion on the top. I look over at her. There\\u2019s a shower door behind my back - the kind where you slide it open to get in and out of the shower. The door is closed. My grandmother and I are sitting on the bench with our backs to the shower door. Now there are a bunch of men. Some man comes over and says, \\u201cHey\\u201d in an interesting way to my grandmother. I realize she\\u2019s a lot younger. She sits up a little bit taller and says hello. I realize he\\u2019s interested in her. I look at her and think, \\u201cWow, Grandma\\u2019s kind of hot! She\\u2019s younger.\\u201d He asks her for her name. She just looks at him flirtatiously but doesn\\u2019t say. I whisper in her ear: \\u201cCan I tell him your name?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say yes, but I think from her behavior that it\\u2019s okay and she actually wants me to. So I tease her for a moment, \\u201cSo I guess I better not say that your name is Grandma!\\u201d She laughs. I say, \\u201cThis is Jean Renning.\\u201d Then they start talking so I think I\\u2019ll just let her talk and have this moment. I leave. I open the sliding glass door to the shower, but it\\u2019s not the shower. It\\u2019s the entrance back to where I was getting ready with Carol and Anne and the hostess. Carol says to me, \\u201cAre you ready yet? Geez, it\\u2019s taking you forever.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah I'm ready!\\u201d So we exit out the door, get into the car, drive across the lift bridge, onto the highway and into where we all work. I check the schedule. The hostess goes to the hostess stand. I have a good section. The owner gives me a dirty look and I know it\\u2019s because I quit and went to go to some other job for a little while then came back. I think he\\u2019s going to do something to punish me for leaving and then coming back later. Then the night progresses - I\\u2019m taking orders and bringing people pub food and beer. Nothing happens that night and the dream eventually ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Feast\\u201d The dream is strange and hard to articulate. There are moments when I\\u2019m in the dream and moments where I\\u2019m looking down and observing the events of the dream. So it starts with being in a carpool parking lot where you're waiting for others to arrive and you leave your car there, then gather in one car. I\\u2019m standing in the parking lot waiting. The car with two people in it that I\\u2019m supposed to join arrives. I leave my car there and I don\\u2019t see it for the rest of the dream. I know one of the people in the car - my friend, Janice. She\\u2019s a paraplegic. The car has hand controls on the steering wheel. Her chair is behind me in the passenger seat. This car will only fit one other person. The other person is supposed to meet us there. We wait for a little bit and she doesn\\u2019t show up. It\\u2019s Lisa, a person I know but am no longer friends with. After we wait a little bit and decide she must not be coming and just didn't tell us, we leave and we drive down the expansive highway to where we\\u2019re supposed to be going - a wedding reception. At this point, I\\u2019m suddenly elevated above the car and watching it move along the highway. I\\u2019m not so far up that it looks like a dot on the map. Maybe it\\u2019s a birds eye view. I can see the trees. I can see the ground. I can see the roofs of houses - they aren\\u2019t that far down from my vision. So I see the car arrive in the parking lot of where the reception is supposed to be held. Then, I help get the chair out for Janice and she gets in it and we both enter into the wedding reception area. She\\u2019s sitting with different people than I am, so we part at the door. I find my seat. I\\u2019m sitting with this man. His name is James and he is the estranged brother of one of my closest friends, Maggie. He is an intolerant angry negative person. I wonder what he\\u2019s going to do next. There\\u2019s a series of platters of bread that the servers bring out from the kitchen. As they set them on the table, people start passing them to the right. Nobody is eating anything. We\\u2019re just passing these plates. At some point they stop being passed and are set down on the table. I look and the differences between the plates of bread are miniscule. Most of the plates are full of square pieces of bread - square buns. Some are plain. Some are glazed. Some have powdery substance. I wonder why no one is eating them. I take one off the plate. I ask James if he\\u2019s going to eat it and wait for his snarky reply. But he doesn\\u2019t say anything and he just takes one of them, takes a bite and sets it down on his plate. I do the same. I wonder who\\u2019s wedding this is. I look around for signs of who\\u2019s the bride and who\\u2019s the groom. I don\\u2019t like the bread. It tastes like sawdust and I only took a tiny tiny bite and set the rest of it down on my plate. I get up and start to wander around the table. It\\u2019s one long table full of people and there\\u2019s the sense that there\\u2019s other tables around me, but my peripheral vision is clouded. I can\\u2019t tell who\\u2019s sitting where. Then, I rise upwards again. I\\u2019m looking at this whole area from the birds eye view. I\\u2019m not quite clear what I\\u2019m looking for, but am just seeing cars coming and going on the highway. It\\u2019s the same thing every time. After a dream moment of doing that, I drop back down to the table again. This time I\\u2019m standing between Janice and somebody else at their end of the table. I\\u2019m aware that they\\u2019re talking, but I\\u2019m not involved in their conversation.I stand there for a few moments, then walk back to my empty seat at the other end of the table. Now there\\u2019s food on myplate. It\\u2019s an uninteresting selection of meat with gravy and mashed potatoes and carrots. I don\\u2019t eat any of it. I just look at it. I\\u2019m disengaged now from the feast and the people and the festivities. I see one other person I know enter into the reception hall. It\\u2019s a friend I\\u2019ve known for years, his name is Joshua. I go over to talk with him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Praying Mantis\\u201d My friend, Randy, asks me if I want to be part of a housing project that is on an island in the Carribean. I agree. We arrive on the island and he tells me that the house that we are going to build first, the one we can stay in and it\\u2019s not going to be on the land, it will be situated on rocks where the water flows, just off of the land. So we get off the airplane and get into a jeep. We\\u2019re riding in the jeep. One of the people that lives on the island is with us. The scenery is flat and wide and it\\u2019s hot and dusty, arid and dry. We arrive down to where the housing project will begin. True enough, as we get out of the jeep, there\\u2019s land and it\\u2019s slightly marshy and there\\u2019s a dividing line with rocks coming out from underneath the crust of land. There\\u2019s a little bit of water and it flows out from the crust like a very small stream, about 6 inches deep overtop some flat rocks. He says this is where the house will begin. There\\u2019s a number of people that live on the island that are already aware of this project. They are present. So we start to construct the house out of cement. The cement needs to be mixed. It\\u2019s poured and then it hardens. The walls are erected with these 2x4\\u2019s. The men are doing this part and Randy has already asked me previous to landing to design a garden. This is something he doesn\\u2019t know how to do himself, but I\\u2019m good at it. I\\u2019ve agreed. So while the men are doing that part, I\\u2019ve got some large pieces of paper, colored pens, and a geometry or drafting set. I start to sketch out the garden, being careful to also sketch out the house first that is not on the land at all and is not supposed to be touching the land, but is supported by the rocks. The house gets to the point where I can now help with some of the internal construction. I notice I\\u2019m wearing work boots, socks, a pair of cargo shorts, a cotton top and a cotton cap that I\\u2019ve made myself. I\\u2019m doing small construction jobs and am working the saw. We\\u2019re beginning the internal part of the house - a covered kitchen and closets in the rooms. Now there are more people helping. I\\u2019ve finished my garden drawing, colored it in and added some vegetation. At this point, one of the women involved in the project has commented on what I\\u2019m wearing. I\\u2019ve promised to make her a cotton top and cap, and also show her how to work a sewing machine. This is going to be on a next trip because I don\\u2019t have any of these things with me. The sun begins to set. People are passing around some oranges as well as something that looks like beer. I accept some of the food and drink and sit in the lawn chair. Randy has indicated that he wants me to sit in between him and one of the other people that live there. So I do. He starts asking me to share my knowledge of the garden and what I know of finishing houses like this on the inside. As I\\u2019m describing this, I realize that this kind of house and this project is a house that has not been built in this way before. Part of it is that the house is not supposed to be able to be swept away by the water. Also, the water has started to flow over the area around the house - it\\u2019s like a dock, but it\\u2019s not. Although, I\\u2019m also starting to see that there will be small boats that can go up and down using the current of the water. They don\\u2019t have keels. They will be tied up to posts that look like angle irons that have been pounded down around the house and this little bit of deck. The house is really small - it looks like the size of a shipping container. You\\u2019ll get your feet wet when you walk into the house. I wonder how practical this will be for spreading things that are on your feet from the land, onto the deck, into the house. But I see that your feet are clean - they are washed by the water by the time you get into the house. So now the sun has started to set and I\\u2019m getting a little bit cold sitting on the lawn chair. I move to go inside the house. Now I see that Randy has stocked some things to the living room, which is finished to the point that the walls and roof are there. There's a rudimentary shell of a kitchen. He also has a stereo. There is electricity now, which wasn\\u2019t in the original plan. He\\u2019s plugged something in and is playing music. He gets out an album and I notice that it's Led Zeppelin, but it\\u2019s one I\\u2019ve never heard before. I think this is weird because I know all their music. He puts it on and I listen to one side and comment to him, \\u201cOh this song is why you played this side of the album, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d He says, yes. It\\u2019s the only thing I can recognize that sounds like Led Zeppelin - a little bit of the guitar. It sounds like Jimmy Page is playing something, somewhat in his own style, but an instrument I don\\u2019t recognize - guitar like, but not actually guitar. Now it\\u2019s nighttime, our flight is due to go back, the day is over and any work we have left will be completed when we come back next time. So we pack things up and get into the jeep to go back. When I get in the jeep, suddenly Omar is there and he\\u2019s sitting beside me in the jeep. He\\u2019s asking me about what we\\u2019ve done there. I realize that Randy can see him. Randy is acting strange, almost like he\\u2019s somewhat possessive or jealous of me and the relationship that Omar and I have. I think this is odd because we\\u2019re just friends. However, we arrive at the airport and Omar doesn\\u2019t get in the plane. Randy and I do, and we have a conversation on the plane. First he looks at my drawings of the garden. He has some markers - there\\u2019s a bright orange, deep red and brilliant blue. He starts marking up the areas on the drawing. He\\u2019s asking, \\u201cWhat can I grow here?\\u201d I tell him. He uses the red marker for that. Then he asks, \\u201cWhat are some things that will grow in this area?\\u201d I describe the kind of food. He marks those and draws in some things with the orange. Same things with the other area and he draws in those with the brilliant blue. Then he puts the drawing away and. Then he asks me about the conversation I had with the woman. I say, \\u201cYes, I think there\\u2019s potential. I can teach her how to make all this clothing with the sewing machine, but I\\u2019m going to have to buy one to bring down there next time.\\u201d He asks, \\u201cHow are you going to get down there?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, isn\\u2019t that included in my work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re going to have to pay for your own flight to come back.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s not what we agreed on when I said I\\u2019d be part of this project.\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s acting jealous because of what I noticed in the jeep with Omar. That\\u2019s when I ask him about his behavior with Omar. He doesn\\u2019t reply to me directly. He doesn\\u2019t answer my questions. Now there\\u2019s this strange energy between us and I remain silent. When we get off the plane, there\\u2019s a gap in the dream. Instantly from the airport, I am now suddenly at Omar\\u2019s mother\\u2019s place and there's a summer gathering. It\\u2019s a potluck and a beautiful day out. It\\u2019s lovely to be in the family again. But I know they aren\\u2019t real and I just enjoy the day where it is. Then it disintegrates. I\\u2019m back in the project with Randy. I don't have enough money for the plane ticket and I don\\u2019t feel like I belong in that group anymore. There\\u2019s energy that is not what I thought it was going to be at the beginning. I\\u2019m reflecting on the day. I look down at my hands and I notice that they\\u2019re curled. The fingers are curled towards my wrists and they don\\u2019t look like my hands. Then I see that the relationships I had with the people don\\u2019t seem as authentic as I thought they were. Then I look at my shoulders and my shoulders look narrow and rounded. I think there\\u2019s something about me that looks insectoid. But it shifts and I\\u2019m thinking if I want to go back and finish this project. I\\u2019m torn between the promises I made to the woman who felt genuine to me and the now soured energy that I feel in my relationship with Randy and the project. But I look down at myself and I realize that my body doesn\\u2019t look like mine at all. I look like a praying mantis and I hate myself.\"],[\"\\u201cNothing much of interest\\u201d I\\u2019m in a forest. I\\u2019m walking through. There\\u2019s no one there. The forest is empty even of animals.Every once in a while I come to a door. It looks like a hallway made of trees that just grow straight up and down like pre-planted rows. I knock on the door, but no one is answering and no one is there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Study\\u201d I dreamt I recorded this dream, but I must not have, because my phone is still off. I am a doctor and I\\u2019m working in an institution. I\\u2019ve been called by the people who hired me to do a study. It requires that I spend 30 days in a jail. I have to sleep there. So I move from the medical end of the institution where I work down to the opposite end of the building. As I walk that way, the lighting changes from that bright fluorescent that is often in hospitals to darker. The hallways are poured cement and a brownish dark grey. The walls, floor and ceiling are all made of the same thing. But it\\u2019s wide. I walk down the hallway and I\\u2019m met by some other staff. They take me into the place where I'm supposed to be spending the next 30 days. I dress in scrubs and go into the cell where they are bringing the participants in the study - there are about 6 or 7 of them, and one is a child, about age 7. We\\u2019re all sleeping on a mattress that\\u2019s been thrown down on the floor. I\\u2019m feeling into their dreams and recording them. I feel safer because there is a child on one side. The child belongs to the other person on the other side, so I think this relationship is safe. The 30 days go by and each night I arrange it so that I\\u2019m in between a child and its parent in the study, so I get by. This one woman kept speaking when she was sleeping in what sounded like a foreign language. Every night she would repeat these words and I couldn\\u2019t make out what they were. I thought they were a foreign language, but on the second to last day of the study, I realize she was saying, \\u201cHam and cheese,\\u201d and there was really only one place in the town where they served ham and cheese and it was this restaurant. That\\u2019s why I was supposed to meet my colleague there - we thought it was connected to the restaurant and were trying to decipher what it was these people had in common that would make them commit such a crime. At the end of the 30 days, I describe what I\\u2019ve observed in the study to another staff member, then I change back into my regular clothes and leave. I exit the building, going down the street, and am meeting someone for lunch. It\\u2019s another colleague.But the building where I\\u2019m supposed to meet them, as I approach it looks odd because it\\u2019s daytime but the lights on the sign are out. It looks closed. But as I get about a foot away from the building, I can see that the restaurant is full - I can see the outline of people in it. But I\\u2019m starting to feel a sense of foreboding in my body. As I get closer to the building, I can see that the people who have the table for two closest to the window, their heads are leaning against the inside of the glass and they look dead. I look in through the window and can see into the restaurant and all the patrons are dead. From the marks on their body, it looks like they\\u2019ve been shot and there is a blood splatter on the walls around them. It looks like every single one of them has been shot and it\\u2019s horrible because there\\u2019s a full demographic of people, including babies. I call on my phone and report this. I didn't call the police, though, I called the team of people I\\u2019ve been working for. I also get in touch with my colleague and say, \\u201cCan you please come down here? Something horrible has happened. You have to call the police.\\u201d So I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk, waiting for that to happen. I\\u2019ve moved away from the front window of the restaurant because of the sheer violence and I don\\u2019t want to look at it. I\\u2019m just staying until help arrives. When it does, I start to walk up the street. In front of me is a building that looks like an old turn of the century middle school. There\\u2019s a sign in front that has a wheel, like a mandala with various colors. The colors are all pushpins and they\\u2019ve been placed there by me. I realize this is one of the earlier studies I\\u2019d done. It was a study of lawyers to see how honest they were, how much integrity they had, and how much they treated their clients fairly. I\\u2019m still waiting for my colleague to show up.I think this study was interesting, too, and I wonder how the study has progressed since I left it. The building across the street from the middle school with the sign is the place where I\\u2019d done the research, so I enter into that building. As soon as I\\u2019m in there, I\\u2019m back in the time when I did the research and I\\u2019m still doing it. I get out the stuff for the mandala and the pushpins. Now I\\u2019m recording. There are more lawyers since I first did the study and I\\u2019m making the wheel. Instead of just having the outside of the wheel full of these colors, I\\u2019m adding more data in, so it\\u2019s starting to fill in the inside of the wheel and the radii that extend down towards the center. What I find when I\\u2019m doing this is that most of the lawyers in the study have external traits and they appear to be good, so they\\u2019re getting some of those colors, but the part where they\\u2019re internally oriented to actually being a benevolent person, they\\u2019re not, so they have some of those colors, too. I look and decide that the study is worthless because they have just as many positive traits externally as they do negative traits internally. So, now I don\\u2019t want to add any more of the data and I exit the building and start walking up the street. As I walk up the street, I start to feel like I\\u2019m being chased. I turn around and see two men. They are indeed pointing at me. They start to run. Now I start to run. As I\\u2019m running, I pick up velocity and I start to float up over the top of the street. Now I\\u2019m just slightly above the roofs of the houses. I don\\u2019t want to get that high up. I want to stay in contact with the roofs. So I see one - it\\u2019s not a flat roof, it\\u2019s open and there\\u2019s an upper floor on top of the building. I think that will be a good one to land in because there are places to hide and perhaps they won\\u2019t see me. As I get closer to the roof of the building, I can feel the unsteadiness of not being grounded. I can see that it\\u2019s a workshop with power tools. I think this is good because I\\u2019ll be able to defend myself. I\\u2019m able to pull myself down onto the rooftop. I\\u2019m looking for something that shoots nails in case they see where I\\u2019ve gone and come after me, which they do. I pick up one of these machines and I aim it at the guy, only it\\u2019s empty - there are no nails in it. As I\\u2019m looking around at all these tools, nothing will shoot at them and they\\u2019re still chasing me. I figure there must be a fire escape somewhere so I run to one side of the building and there is. I go down one flight, down another flight, down another flight, and then there\\u2019s a floor and there\\u2019s a woman standing in the kitchen. I lock the door and say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, I\\u2019m being chased. Can you call the police?\\u201d That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Move\\u201d I\\u2019m preparing different areas for a move to somewhere else that doesn\\u2019t have a physical space. It feels like I\\u2019m hopping or transforming into a different time. I first go to a house I lived in where my daughter decided she was going to live with her boyfriend. The house is disheveled - half moved out and half not. I just ask her to sit down for a moment and explain to her where I\\u2019m going and that I\\u2019ll still have a place for her. I\\u2019ve got some of the things she didn\\u2019t take with her and still carry them and will bring them with me so there will always be a place for her to go to - there will be a designated space for her. I\\u2019m going to slide her bed up inside the wall, so I can use the floorspace for something else. When she needs her room, I\\u2019ll just bring her bed out of the wall and place it down on the floor. It won\\u2019t take very long. She seems happy with this, so I give her a hug. Then she leaves. I go down a few steps and cross over into the garage. The garage is bigger than I thought it would be and than I remembered it was. There\\u2019s a really, really long trunk in it. I open it. The rest of the stuff in there has no value to me - I\\u2019m not taking it. But I think, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in that trunk?\\u201d When I open it up, it\\u2019s way bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. There are some antiques in it that belong to my grandparents. I sort a few things out from there. I remove a few things and leave some things. Then I close the trunk and I leave that house. I\\u2019ve got something else to pick up that I\\u2019ve been storing at a farm that belongs to my friend, Rob. I have to drive a different car to get there. Although, In a previous dream I\\u2019ve walked that really long expansive highway before. I\\u2019m not going to walk this time, due to lack of time, so I drive my car. As I get close to the road where Rob lives on the farm, I have to leave the highway and go off onto the farm road. I drive halfway up the road and see a woman I\\u2019ve only met once in person, but I\\u2019m involved in a project with her, electronically. I see her and she comes walking towards me as I pull my car over to the side of the road. I know I\\u2019m not supposed to park in the driveway and I\\u2019ve already arranged with my friend Rob that he will come out and meet me. So, Kem walks over towards the car and we have a conversation about farms, eggs and growing things. Although the conversation is really interesting, I tell her, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I have to leave now.\\u201d So she just says goodbye and walks away. Rob has arrived and he has my grandmother\\u2019s vehicle. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019ve taken care of it for you, but did not have time to switch the tires over. I don\\u2019t have the tools to do that anymore. You\\u2019ll have to take it to the garage up the road.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, thanks for storing it for so long.\\u201c I leave my car on the side of the road and get in my grandmother\\u2019s vehicle. I drive it up to where Rob indicated and as I pull in that parking lot, the mechanic comes out and asks if he can help me. I say, \\u201cYes, I need the tires changed over on my car.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThis is yours?\\u201d And I say, yes. He says, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the kind of car a woman would have. They don\\u2019t know how to take care of these things.\\u201d I feel a bit of umbrage bubble up in my chest, but I don\\u2019t tell him . I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s any point to trying to break through his preconceived notion. Instead, I just get out of the car, pop the hood, and do a couple things to the engine. I get the tires out of the trunk and say, \\u201cAre you able to put these on the rims and change them or not?\\u201d He looks a little bit surprised and says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s all you need?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes. Can you do it or not?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, I can do that.\\u201d So, I\\u2019m waiting. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just going to take me a day. Can you leave it here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I don\\u2019t really trust him, but because Rob says he\\u2019s quite capable, I decide to trust Rob\\u2019s judgment instead and I leave the car there. Now I\\u2019m walking back up the laneway and have some time to think before getting in my own car. I\\u2019m sifting through my mind thinking, \\u201cWhat else do I need to prepare for this move?\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Photo Chest\\u201d I\\u2019m walking across a really long bridge. It feels a little bit cold and windy and as though I\\u2019m walking against the wind and uphill. The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that\\u2019s been empty for a few years. It\\u2019s where my daughter\\u2019s grandparents used to live. They\\u2019ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter\\u2019s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It\\u2019s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It\\u2019s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There\\u2019s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There\\u2019s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It\\u2019s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There\\u2019s one point where I\\u2019m a little bit surprised at Roberta\\u2019s description. They aren\\u2019t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter\\u2019s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There\\u2019s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it\\u2019s her because her face doesn\\u2019t really change. She\\u2019s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I\\u2019d never heard of this woman before. I\\u2019m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn\\u2019t aware of. We just pass the day looking through all these generations of mostly women in the photographs. It was lovely.\"],[\"\\u201cPieces of I.D.\\u201d I\\u2019m in something that feels like the shape of an orchestra pit. It\\u2019s quite crowded with people. A few of the people are sitting in front of drafting boards. The drafting boards take up a lot of room - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019re almost side to side. There are more people than drafting boards, so the excess people make it feel really packed. I feel like I have some kind of amnesia as I sit in front of my drafting board. I don\\u2019t know what I'm supposed to be drawing. So I start to circulate amongst the people. It\\u2019s all hazy. I don\\u2019t know anyone, I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to draw. I\\u2019m approaching some of the people. I\\u2019m climbing over other people that are just sitting there. It\\u2019s literally packed with people. I\\u2019m hearing rather than seeing that some people are involved in a conversation with their drafting board. I realize that even though you can\\u2019t really see what they\\u2019ve drawn, the conversation they are having with it is they are telling it their life story, but there are too many details to draw. So there\\u2019s another kind of media that produces an imprint on the drafting board, the person who is the architect of their life. Then I have some kind of idea of what is supposed to be on mine and I make my way back to it, but then I can\\u2019t remember what I\\u2019m supposed to put on it. I know there\\u2019s a conversation, but I don\\u2019t have enough of an idea of what mine is in order to begin the conversation that will imprint upon my drafting board. So in an effort to discover more detail, I leave the orchestra pit adn I start to walk towards a building. I realize the building is a hospital. I enter in the front door. I decide to get on the elevator and go up. I don\\u2019t press any buttons; the elevator moves on its own accord. It stops at a floor and I get off. It\\u2019s some kind of surgery and recovery floor. I wander around for a bit. There are some nurses and other staff around but I don\\u2019t engage with them. Then I get back on the elevator. This time it goes down. I get off. I didn't find anything that gave me any inspiration either to remember or tell my story. So I wander out the front door. Instead of going back to the pit, I walk through the street. I look to see if there\\u2019s anything that sparks any memory. It\\u2019s an urban street with all kinds of people. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are vendors and street artists drawing. At one point I get tired of walking and so I sit down on a bench. The bench is not parallel to the street. It\\u2019s perpendicular to the street, around the side of the building. I sit there just resting. A man was sitting there the whole time, but I didn\\u2019t see him. Now that my eyes have adjusted, I start to see him. I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll just stay there and be quiet. But he doesn\\u2019t. He starts trying to engage with me and talk with me. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. In fact he seems kind of abrasive and now he\\u2019s in my space. Instead of sitting on his own bench, he\\u2019s now come up beside me. I feel slightly threatened by his presence. I reach into my pockets, make two fists and shove them into my pockets. I feel something in my right hand and it\\u2019s three cards - they feel plastic, like credit cards. I pull them out and I look at them. It\\u2019s my identification. One is a driver's license. One is a bank card. The other one I think is a social insurance card. They have my name on them. My driver\\u2019s license even has a picture of me. I suddenly remember who I am. I\\u2019m afraid the man is going to steal them even though they aren't worth any money. I think he might take my ID. So, I put them back in my pocket. It looks like he hasn\\u2019t seen them, so I\\u2019m thinking this is good. I stand up slowly and walk away. I turn right, trying to remember where I live. I walk up the street. I see with some dismay, my ex-husband. My first instinct is to turn around and go the other way. But I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, he probably knows where I live.\\u201d I decide to tackle this anyway. As I walk through the crowd of people, he recognizes me and looks up. I stop in front of him. But I don\\u2019t want him to know that I can\\u2019t remember where I live. So as I approach and slow my pace, I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll say something to me first. He does. He asks me where I\\u2019m going. I say I\\u2019m heading home. He says, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I wait, hoping he\\u2019ll give me some clue where that is. He doesn\\u2019t say anything. Then he says, \\u201cJust a second. I\\u2019m trying to load up these bags.\\u201d I look down and he\\u2019s got shopping bags. He has a lot of stuff that he\\u2019s trying to put inside of them. It looks to me like he doesn\\u2019t have enough bags. He keeps putting things in, then taking them out, trying to reorganize them in an effort to fit everything. Then he hands me the bags and says, \\u201cCan you do this?\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer, but I just start to organize. Then he wanders off. I'm just organizing his stuff in the bags and I\\u2019m actually making it all fit. It reminds me of packing to go places when we were married and how he would say things didn\\u2019t fit in the car, and I would go and fit it in. It reminded me that I always had to do stuff for him. I\\u2019m slightly irritated that here I am back on the street and trying to find my way home, and here I am waylaid by trying to put his stuff in his bags. Then I focus again on the task. A woman comes up and asks if any of this is for sale. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not mine.\\u201d But as I look at the bags, I see one has some of my stuff in it and am wondering what it is. It\\u2019s CD\\u2019s. So I look at them and wonder why he has all my CD\\u2019s. As I\\u2019m wondering this he arrives and says, \\u201cOh, I see you\\u2019re finished. It all fit. This is good. Let\\u2019s go now. Why don\\u2019t you take that bag? I\\u2019ll take the rest.\\u201d It\\u2019s the one with my own CD\\u2019s in it. I decide to ask him, \\u201cDo you know where these belong?\\u201d and I indicate the bag of CD\\u2019s. He says, yes. I say, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust up the street a couple blocks.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh, good. He knows where I live.\\u201d So I decide that\\u2019s good. Then I ask, \\u201cDo you know where the rest of my purse is? I\\u2019ve only got these three pieces of ID.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s in one of those bags.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Barge\\u201d A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It\\u2019s quite intricate and detailed. I\\u2019m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don\\u2019t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we\\u2019re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I\\u2019ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I\\u2019m just standing there. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m at a really large lake or an ocean. I\\u2019m just watching. I\\u2019m looking at the water. You can\\u2019t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It\\u2019s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It\\u2019s also very balmy and a bit windy. I\\u2019m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It\\u2019s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They\\u2019re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I\\u2019m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I\\u2019m being told that it\\u2019s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it\\u2019s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we\\u2019re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I\\u2019m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I\\u2019m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don\\u2019t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I\\u2019ve been with before. I don\\u2019t try to join them because they\\u2019re in a family grouping. There\\u2019s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don\\u2019t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I\\u2019ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what\\u2019s there. There are muffins. But I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re gluten-free and I know I can\\u2019t eat wheat, so I don\\u2019t get them. There\\u2019s something else on the table. I\\u2019m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she\\u2019s too short and can\\u2019t reach it. I\\u2019m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, \\u201cMy mom said I can have one.\\u201d So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, \\u201cJust a minute, let\\u2019s find your parents.\\u201d She points further up the pier and says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re over there.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t see anybody. She\\u2019s fairly determined and tugging me. We\\u2019re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It\\u2019s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, \\u201cOh look! It\\u2019s garbage day.\\u201d So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It\\u2019s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I\\u2019m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there\\u2019s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it\\u2019s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that\\u2019s on the pier. I think. \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d The post is still standing. I think that\\u2019s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, \\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they\\u2019re supposed to be here. He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see anyone.\\u201d I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there\\u2019s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they\\u2019ve all been in this trauma but she\\u2019s not going to go because she\\u2019s not ready. Now I\\u2019m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I\\u2019m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I\\u2019ve got my laptop with me and I don\\u2019t want to take it. I say to her, \\u201cIs it okay if I leave this in your room?\\u201d She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I\\u2019m getting into a Jeep. It\\u2019s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they\\u2019re all cut out for open air. So I\\u2019m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it\\u2019s cleared out and doesn\\u2019t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There\\u2019s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they\\u2019re with. I don\\u2019t have a \\u201cwhoever I\\u2019m with\\u201d so I don\\u2019t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. You can\\u2019t see the sun overhead, though. There\\u2019s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It\\u2019s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don\\u2019t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven\\u2019t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don\\u2019t know what time we\\u2019re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don\\u2019t see any. At one point the day feels like it\\u2019s gone on. I am hungry but I don\\u2019t have any food. I\\u2019m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren\\u2019t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I\\u2019m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I\\u2019m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they\\u2019re having together and they don\\u2019t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I\\u2019m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I\\u2019m looking for staff to help me. I\\u2019m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I\\u2019m going to miss supper as well. I\\u2019ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a store of some sort. It\\u2019s crowded and dingy and junky. I\\u2019ve paid for something that I don\\u2019t want and it\\u2019s not mine, but I\\u2019ve done it as a favor for someone else. I\\u2019m not begrudging of it either. I am just not particularly fancied with this store. Then I get picked up by two people. I don\\u2019t remember who they are. One of them is the person that I\\u2019ve picked up this thing from the store for. There\\u2019s an exchange of money that goes on. I\\u2019m trying to divide it up evenly - the change. The first time I count it all out and give half to the other person and keep half for myself. I count it and I\\u2019m missing money, so I ask if I can have all the money back. I put it all together and look at it again. There\\u2019s a couple of fives, a ten, and a twenty. I see that the twenty actually should belong to me. I should be keeping that because I paid for the item. The rest of it is divided up evenly between us. This time it works out and I explain why I need to keep the twenty - why it isn\\u2019t part of the change. Now we\\u2019ve arrived at where we\\u2019re supposed to be going. We get out of the car and go in. It's a house down by the lake. But it\\u2019s down by the port, so it\\u2019s one of those turn of the century places that sprung up near there. There\\u2019s stucco on the outside. It could have been an inn on the bottom floor - a place we could go in and get ale and food and then sleep upstairs - that kind of inn. They\\u2019re narrow and tall and stuccoed. The house belongs to somebody. I realize that it\\u2019s the skipper from the sail club. We\\u2019re supposed to eat supper there, stay overnight and then sail the next day. We havent really eaten food in the dream. But the meal seems to be finished. We go down to the water to look at the boat. It\\u2019s half submerged. The material it\\u2019s made out of is all ruined. I\\u2019m looking at it thinking there\\u2019s no way that thing is going to sail. It\\u2019s not seaworthy. The man - the owner of the boat - is describing why it will be seaworthy. I say, \\u201cWell, why don\\u2019t we start by lifting it up out of the water, dumping the water that\\u2019s in it and see if it fills with water again.\\u201d He agrees. We pick it up, turn it over and put it back in the water. He says: \\u201cThere, that should do it.\\u201d I turn around and it\\u2019s almost submerged again - it\\u2019s filled with water to the extent that there\\u2019s only a little bit of the gunnels sticking up out of the water. I have my serious doubts. Plus, the stern is all buckled in. The mast is bent in the middle. He\\u2019s gone back into his house. I look at it a little bit longer. I\\u2019m standing on the pier looking at the other ships moored up there, then just gazing out at the water wishing I could sail, but thinking it\\u2019s not likely going to happen. Then I go back into the house. The man that owns the boat is looking for some of the sheets for the boat. He says, \\u201cThey were right here a while ago.\\u201d I look and see a single bed in front of me. I pull the sheets back and realize there are two sets made out of tin foil - the kind of material an emergency blanket would be made out of. I tell him, \\u201cLook, you must have put both sets on one bed to save storage.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, yes, that was a good idea.\\u201d I peel off the top two, fold them up and give them to him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Seven Centres\\u201d This dream starts at a wedding reception. I\\u2019m there with my daughter and my daughter's boyfriend. The reception probably holds about 50-60 people. The hall is big enough that it doesn\\u2019t feel crowded. There\\u2019s a certain amount of space between people. In fact, we are sitting at our own table. The table is bigger. There are lots of empty chairs. No one else is supposed to be sitting there. There are only three place settings - mine, my daughter\\u2019s and her guest. I\\u2019ve taken some time to do my hair before I go out. I\\u2019m wearing a silver tiara. It\\u2019s not fancy, it just wraps like a headband made of malleable silver wire. I\\u2019m using it to keep the hair from falling in front of my eyes if I tilt my head forward. I also have a multi-strand silver bracelet on my left wrist with tiny stones in it - they are opalesce in appearance. I\\u2019m wearing a light blue dress and it feels really good on my body. We\\u2019re having a conversation at the table. I excuse myself for a moment to use the restroom. On my way to the hall, this man comes up behind me. He\\u2019s fairly boisterous. I don't turn around to look at him. He\\u2019s trying to exert himself into my consciousness. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. After I come out of the restroom, I see him again. He\\u2019s sitting at a table with some other people. Again, he\\u2019s boisterous and loud, so he\\u2019s distracting. When i return to the table with my daughter and her boyfriend, he comes to sit with us. He\\u2019s trying to sell all of us on this idea that he makes some kind of chart that explores people\\u2019s personalities and lends them insights into themselves. I listen to him for a few minutes then decline his services. However, he leaves his business card. I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s located in Lindsay, a town I\\u2019m familiar with and know that I\\u2019m going to be visiting some time in the future. We finish our meal, the plates are taken away, and we are encouraged to stand up as the staff moves the table away to allow for dancing. We\\u2019re dancing as the same units as the table seating was arranged in. at one point, that same man comes up and just begins dancing. He\\u2019s fairly physical - really getting in my space and standing behind me and pressing his body up against mine and dancing with me. Then he leaves. There\\u2019s a point where the dance just goes on and on. It\\u2019s a lot of shaking, like ecstatic dance. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember the dance ending and us ending up at home in our beds. So when I wake up in the dream, I think, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really strange that we danced ourselves into this non-remembering place. I wonder how we got home?\\u201d We are home. Then I notice that the bracelet I had around my wrist is now in my hair. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a good idea, using it to tie the rest of my hair back so I can dance.\\u201d I go and look at it in the mirror and think, \\u201cOh, it even looks good. I like the way it looks.\\u201d When I leave the bathroom, I walk down the hall and notice that I am in the physical house of my step grandmother. I remember that there\\u2019s something I\\u2019m supposed to do when I\\u2019m here. I need to meet some of the people that were at the wedding reception the previous night. So, I organize myself. I get some breakfast. I have a shower and change my clothes. My daughter and her boyfriend don\\u2019t have to do these errands, so they\\u2019re staying in the living room. They\\u2019re occupied with some other activities. When I leave to go out the front door - it is winter time in the dream - I lock myself out. In order for my step-grandma to know I\\u2019m there and we\\u2019re in the house, I move one of the bricks from the garden and put it at the front door. Then I walk across the street to the neighbor\\u2019s house who is usually always home. They know each other. I knock on the door, she comes out and I tell her what I\\u2019ve done. She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I actually have a key. I\\u2019ll just let you in.\\u201d She walks back across the street with me, we open the door, I make sure it\\u2019s not locked this time, and say goodbye to her. She returns to her own house. I walk up the street. I turn right and I go to visit someone who still lives there. There are a number of family members standing in the driveway, having a conversation. I speak to the matriarch of the family and give her a hug. We have a conversation about what everyone is doing. After this conversation is over, I continue back up the street. There\\u2019s a little girl heading towards me. She\\u2019s only about two. I\\u2019m thinking she should not be out in the winter, she doesn\\u2019t even have a winter coat on. But I turn around and one of the people from the driveway exclaims, \\u201cOh, what are you doing? You\\u2019re supposed to still be in the house!\\u201d I realize it\\u2019s her own daughter. She goes up the street, picks up the little girl and is holding her. She says, \\u201cOh, I remember you. The last time I saw you, I was only 9 and you were with Daren\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh yes, I remember you.\\u201d I call her by name. She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s right. Why don\\u2019t you come in for a visit?\\u201d I agree to do that and tell her that I can only stay for a few minutes. We go into her house. It\\u2019s the house she grew up in and now it belongs to just her. She sets the little girl down, brushes her off and does the mom fingers through her hair thing. The little girl goes off to play. We sit down for a few minutes and she tells me what she\\u2019s doing. As we start to finish this conversation, another woman comes into the house whom I recognize, but I know she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. She\\u2019s lost a lot of weight and her face really looks different. I call her by name and she looks at me puzzled. I tell her who I am. She\\u2019s Daren\\u2019s youngest sister. She says, \\u201cOh, I really don't remember you, but I remember everybody else talking about you.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a bad thing. She just knows me from conversations but doesn\\u2019t remember me visually. We have a conversation. Then I tell her I have to get going and I have these errands to run. She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll walk with you. I\\u2019m going the same direction.\\u201d She tells me where she\\u2019s going and it\\u2019s the same man\\u2019s place with the business card. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, really? I\\u2019m surprised that anyone is interested in this.\\u201d She describes it as being very popular and he\\u2019s well-respected in this area where they all live. I think, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s on the way, maybe I\\u2019ll stop and see where his office is.\\u201d So, we do this. It\\u2019s snowing out. It\\u2019s really nice. I can feel the flakes landing on my face. It\\u2019s so cooling. Everything is just covered with this white magical veil. It\\u2019s just gorgeous. We walk to the end of the street and into this man\\u2019s office. It\\u2019s painted on the door. It looks like one of those 1940 detective show movies with the door with glass on top and name painted on the top like an arc and it has the \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d underneath. So, his name is painted in the shape of a rainbow. \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d is written vertically down and he\\u2019s got a picture of himself there. I\\u2019m laughing to myself because he\\u2019s wearing a turban and looks like a fake fortune teller. But there are other people waiting in line to see him and I\\u2019m astonished that people think this guy knows the future and all these deep secrets about them. I just can\\u2019t believe it. I also note that it\\u2019s progressed from the guy at the wedding reception handing out business cards, jollying it up with everyone, to now wearing a turban. His hair was short and grey. So the idea that he even needs a turban is ludicrous. So now I know where his office is and say goodbye to Daren\\u2019s sister. I carry on for my own errands. I go into a few shops. I\\u2019m just picking up small supplies. I go into a cheese shop and get a little tiny bit of cheese. I go into a meat shop and get a little bit of meat. Then I stop and get a few vegetables and fruit at the market. So I've got two bags in my arms and am walking back through the snow lined streets. There are no cars and nobody else walking. I can hear my feet crunching against the snow. I arrive back at my step-grandmother\\u2019s house. My daughter and her boyfriend are still in the living room. He\\u2019s doing something on a laptop and she\\u2019s doing something on a handheld device. I tell them that they need to come in and help prepare the food. I set it down and notice on the clock that there\\u2019s still two hours before we need to eat. I feel like I want to do something to keep occupied, but I don\\u2019t have anything else with me and it\\u2019s not my house. So, I go into the living room and sit down even though I know they\\u2019re both absorbed by their activities and me sitting there talking with them is not going to be welcomed. However, my daughter says to me, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you tell Joe what your dreams have been and he\\u2019ll record them on his laptop?\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cwhy would I do this? I already have my own dream journal at home?\\u201d But she\\u2019s looking at me the way you try to silently tell someone with your eyes: go, go, do it! So, I\\u2019m like okay, I guess this is meaningful, I\\u2019ll do it. So I say, \\u201cHey, do you want to record one of my dreams?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, sure.\\u201d I tell him this particular dream and I know it's\\u2019 got a number of parts to it. I peak over to see what he\\u2019s writing. He\\u2019s written two paragraphs and they\\u2019re not as detailed as I\\u2019m telling him. What\\u2019s fascinating is there\\u2019s a part on the screen where the words are turning into characters. So, for example, one of the words describing the wedding with the people seated around, but not saying anything are now flying but don\\u2019t have mouths. Some of the words are different colors. I look and I say, \\u201cOh my goodness! This is dream software. It\\u2019s animating my dream story!\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, isn\\u2019t it cool?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, this really is!\\u201d I ask him what it\\u2019s called and he tells me, but I don\\u2019t remember when I woke up. Then, he stops writing and he\\u2019s distracted and patting the cat\\u2019s head. He\\u2019s just recording this a lot more slowly than I can possibly speak. I feel myself getting a little frustrated that I want to get up and move, even though I\\u2019m fascinated by this software, I want to do something else while he\\u2019s not typing. So I get up and go into the kitchen. My daughter says, \\u201cDo you want him to finish or not?\\u201d I feel there\\u2019s an internal cognitive dissonance between wanting to finish and not wanting to sit there for the length of time it takes to do this. While I\\u2019m experiencing this cognitive dissonance, he gets tired of waiting for me to reply, leaves his chair and goes upstairs. Now I\\u2019m in the kitchen and thinking I might as well start prepping the vegetables. While I\\u2019m doing this, the doorbell rings and it\\u2019s this same man though he\\u2019s wearing a turban this time! He comes into the house and sits down in the living room. To my dismay, I see he\\u2019s already got my daughter sucked into his diagram of what he knows about her psyche and what he can predict from it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUgh!\\u201d So I think I should sit down and make sure I hear what he\\u2019s telling her so I can protect her from his lies. As I\\u2019m listening to him, I realize he\\u2019s using some points that have some validation in the world of psychology. I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s what he uses as a hook to get people to believe his ludicrous claims. And then he\\u2019s also using the same colors of the chakras from yoga and saying these are the 7 energetic centres that he works with. So he\\u2019s taken something from academic psychology and some hokey stuff and woven it through the chakras, but made himself the carrier of this information, so people have to pay him and go to his centre in order to receive his wisdom that actually isn\\u2019t even his, but something he\\u2019s whipped up from other people\\u2019s work.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Chandelier\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of building. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m teaching a teacher training, but it\\u2019s really different. The training is to help people connect to and expand their senses so that they have an expanded experience in their daily lives. I\\u2019m really enjoying using plants, food and light in the training. I\\u2019m fascinated by the process, actually. I teach every other weekend. On this particular weekend in May, May 23, I\\u2019m not supposed to be teaching. However, I have been borrowing things to use as equipment and examples - just gathering and borrowing rather than buying things to use in the teaching. This one friend of mine, Thomas has contributed something I can use in the training. He\\u2019s dropping it off athte facility where I teach as opposed to bringing it to my house. So I have to go in on my day off to meet him there. I am surprised that the doors are open and there seems to be another school going on. I\\u2019m just a little surprised because I was expecting it to be empty. But there\\u2019s another training of some sort involving children in one room and this is the room where I normally do my training. So I wait until there\\u2019s a little bit of a break and I wave to the person who is facilitating. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I just go over here and leave some stuff in the cupboard?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s no problem. You can join in if you want to.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you. It\\u2019s my day off. I just want to quickly drop this off and then I\\u2019ll be on my way.\\u201d But Thomas is not there yet. So I end up sitting off to the side and watch what she\\u2019s teaching. I think, \\u201cWow, that's a really different approach. I love the outside the box way she\\u2019s teaching the same old thing to these students.\\u201d I feel this curiosity for and respect for her teaching method. My friend arrives. He\\u2019s got a big cardboard box in his arms and says, \\u201cI need to assemble this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, well, let\\u2019s go into one of the empty rooms so we\\u2019re not bothering anyone else.\\u201d We exit out the backdoor of the first classroom. The next room, which I also expected to be empty wasn\\u2019t. Someone is in there setting up food. It\\u2019s a break room. He sets the cardboard box on the counter that has a sink at it. I say I\\u2019ll be back in a second. I go into the first room that I left because I\\u2019ve left some bags in there. As I'm collecting them, I look out the windows and see that some of the plants I normally use have been crushed. Something has stepped on them. I\\u2019m wanting to preserve them, so I need a bucket or something I can use to dig them up and put them in so I can wash off the roots and put them in fresh soil. I ask the first teacher if she has anything. She says, \\u201cNo, but there might be something in the kitchen.\\u201d So now I\\u2019ve got the plants in my hands. I\\u2019m holding onto them and I can feel how delicate the roots are when they\\u2019re not supported with the soil. There\\u2019s a little bit of urgency for me needing to find a container for them. I go back into the break room. The woman who was setting up has got a really, really big heavy urn, like 3 feet by 2 feet. It\\u2019s some kind of elaborate tea and coffee maker. My friend is helping her set them up instead of assembling what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. She looks like she\\u2019s finished now. Everything is stacked up. I ask her if I can use one of the plastic cups for my plants and I show her that they need some support and I need to put them in soil or they\\u2019re going to die. She says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t give you one of these. They\\u2019re all counted for. If I give you one of these, then someone will have to go without a cup of tea.\\u201d She says that maybe there is something in one of the cupboards. I\\u2019m looking through the cupboards and can\\u2019t find anything yet. I\\u2019m starting to feel like my whole day off is becoming consumed by this task. I ask Thomas if he can expedite putting together what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. He seems to be getting distracted by all the other activities and people. He says, \\u201cOkay, yes. I\\u2019ll assemble it now.\\u201d I go back into the first room and show the facilitator. She is sitting and leaning against the wall while the rest of her students are busy with activities. I show her the plants and ask her if she has a container I can put them in. She reaches underneath, opens one of the cupboard doors and gets a container and gives it to me. Now I\\u2019ve got them in a container, so their leaves won\\u2019t get crushed. But I still don\\u2019t have any soil. At this point, Thomas comes out of the back door and he\\u2019s assembled what he brought. It is 5 feet wide. He\\u2019s holding it at the top kind of like someone would hold a mobile. But it\\u2019s not a mobile. It\\u2019s a light. The light is made of tiny copper wires - they\\u2019re really quite delicate and it\\u2019s beautiful. They expand outwards and then downwards. The downward links of wire are all different lengths. Every 4 or 5 inches there\\u2019s a tiny light. So it\\u2019s a very beautiful, wide light. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to get this home now that it's assembled?\\u201d He\\u2019s carrying it. Then, he asks me what it\\u2019s for. I start explaining to him. I\\u2019m feeling obligated to teach a little of what I\\u2019m using this network of light for in the training. I start telling him. One of my own students who looks like she\\u2019s just woken up from a nap comes out of another room and says, \\u201cOh, did we have school today?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, no, we don\\u2019t.\\u201d Then I see another one coming and she\\u2019s asking if she\\u2019s missed out on any content. I say, \\u201cNo I was just telling Thomas this.\\u201d Then I realize I need to stop. Now it\\u2019s turning into a day\\u2019s teaching and it\\u2019s supposed to be my day off. So I tell them, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019ll cover this next Sunday. Don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d They go back their own way. I tell Thomas, \\u201cI really need to get this home. It\\u2019s almost 3 o\\u2019clock and I want to have some time to myself.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m carrying the little plant in the container. He\\u2019s gingerly carrying the really wide delicate light chandelier. We exit the building and go into the parking lot. He\\u2019s got a motorcycle and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this safely on a motorcycle? I didn\\u2019t realize that was his mode of transportation.\\u201d I say out loud, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this light on the motorcycle?\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, it will be fine.\\u201d He puts it along the inside of the passenger seat, which has a curved arm and back. He says, \\u201cYou can just lean against it there.\\u201d I do. I swing my leg over and sit on the passenger seat. Now I\\u2019ve got the plant in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to protect it with my body. I\\u2019m trying not to crush the light. He gets on the motorcycle, starts it up and begins to drive really fast. I\\u2019m having a hard time hanging onto the plant. Now i look down and one of my cats is in my arms. He\\u2019s all tense and he\\u2019s trying to jump off. I\\u2019m terrified that he will because he\\u2019s really wiry and he\\u2019s big and I\\u2019ve got this plant in one hand. I\\u2019m afraid he\\u2019s going to get crushed on the highway. So, Thomas takes one of his hands off the handle of the bike and is also holding onto the cat. I can see the cat\\u2019s claw is cutting into his arm and he\\u2019s bleeding. I ask him, \\u201cCan we please pull over and arrange this so that the cat is being held firmly by someone and everything else is protected?\\u201d He does. I get a better grip of the cat and have the plant under the other arm. He starts the bike up again. I think, \\u201cWow, I hope I can hang onto this and everyone is okay until we get home.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cAlien Lover\\u201d In this dream I find a dish underneath a chair. I take it out of the chair and notice there is a seed in it. I\\u2019m curious to see what the seed is so I give it some water. The seed expands. It happens very quickly. It expands into a baby. The baby stays a baby for perhaps a couple of days, whereas the seed grew into a baby in a couple of minutes. Over the course of the days that it\\u2019s a baby, I notice that it has a fondness for food that is different than people normally give babies. My relatives and in particular, my sister-in-law try to give the baby things they would have given to their own babies. I keep telling them, \\u201cNo, he doesn't like that kind of food.\\u201d They\\u2019re not forcing him to eat food, they just keep offering him this regular baby food. He keeps refusing it. I put the baby into a bed that I\\u2019ve made and swaddle him with what I\\u2019ve got around to wrap him in. The next day he is a boy. It\\u2019s the same thing with the nourishment where my relatives and in particular my sister-in-law offer him what they think a boy should eat. He doesn\\u2019t eat it. But I\\u2019m giving him some different kind of food and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It\\u2019s not even really food. It\\u2019s not plants. It\\u2019s just something I intuitively know he would like, but the rest of my family is not noticing or not recognizing that it\\u2019s food. But it does nourish him and he grows really quickly. I put him to bed that night as a boy. Before he even goes to sleep, I watch him change into a man. I can clearly see his features. His face grows into something that is a bit angular in terms of jaw and chin and nose. He has brown hair, brown eyes, brown eyebrows. He\\u2019s quite tall and thin. Other than looking somewhat elfish of face, he doesn\\u2019t look strange. Anyone would think he is human and no one would know that he\\u2019s really grown out of a petri dish. So he\\u2019s no longer content to stay in the house. He leaves. He just goes out the door. There\\u2019s a regular day in my home. I\\u2019m not leaving the home. I\\u2019m making something out of fabric woven out of a really pretty navy silk that I\\u2019m weaving gold threads through. When I hang it up on the window, the navy part darkens the light so it doesn\\u2019t come through and pierce my eyes, but the gold picks it up, so it sparkles in the daylight without overwhelming. Then the man comes back at some point in a day. He sits. He doesn\\u2019t speak. He never speaks, but I intuitively know what to offer him. He seems content. I offer him to lie down in the bed. So he does, but he doesn\\u2019t sleep. He\\u2019s awake. I\\u2019m not really overly concerned with trying to communicate with him. The way he carries himself, he seems content. He never seems agitated, but he also never smiles. He\\u2019s lying in the bed, but he\\u2019s not sleeping. I can\\u2019t stay awake anymore, so I sleep. I feel at some point in the middle of the night that he\\u2019s hugging me. It feels nice. He just hugs me. When the light comes through the window covering that I\\u2019ve made - the one of navy and gold - I get up and so does he. He gets up and goes somewhere again through the day. I\\u2019m busy with some kind of activity in the house. I\\u2019m not alone in the house. There are a few other of my relatives there. This pattern continues for a number of nights. At one point I feel like we are lovers, but it\\u2019s not really acted out in the dream. It feels very natural and that\\u2019s really all there is - just a lifetime of staying with him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Time Machine\\u201d This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There\\u2019s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house\\u2019s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it\\u2019s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I\\u2019m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it\\u2019s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, \\u201cI have to take this.\\u201d He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he\\u2019s in the kitchen, although I haven\\u2019t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He\\u2019s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, \\u201cHe left you a gift.\\u201d I feel sad. I also feel like I don\\u2019t want to be alone with her. I\\u2019m starting to wonder how I\\u2019m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I\\u2019m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I\\u2019m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there\\u2019s a really strong emotion. It\\u2019s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that\\u2019s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn\\u2019t appear and I knew it wouldn\\u2019t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I\\u2019m an adult now. I\\u2019m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it\\u2019s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don\\u2019t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I\\u2019m hoping they\\u2019ll still be there when I leave. I\\u2019m glad he still hasn\\u2019t returned to England and I\\u2019ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I\\u2019m confused because I can\\u2019t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it\\u2019s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they\\u2019re in charge: \\u201cDo you know what happened to the classrooms?\\u201d She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, \\u201cDo you know this one is out of date?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, no I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, you\\u2019ll need to go down to the office.\\u201d She tells me the number of the office and says, \\u201cYou need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They\\u2019re just saying hello and stuff and I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren\\u2019s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on asphalt in a really old town. I\\u2019m part of a play. It\\u2019s like a movie set, but it\\u2019s not a movie set, it\\u2019s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I\\u2019ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It\\u2019s white and about 12 inches square - it\\u2019s a cube. They put this in between each word. It\\u2019s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that\\u2019s describing this tells me, \\u201cYes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they\\u2019ve been forgotten.\\u201d He told me the one we\\u2019re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there\\u2019s a picnic table. We\\u2019re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we\\u2019re waiting. It\\u2019s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it\\u2019s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They\\u2019re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn\\u2019t have food, though. He has sewing. I\\u2019m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don\\u2019t even know what it is - I choose that one. I\\u2019m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it\\u2019s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we\\u2019re entering this vehicle. It\\u2019s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but I think it\\u2019s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it\\u2019s got some kind of engine - it\\u2019s not very loud; it\\u2019s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we\\u2019re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,\\u201dWe\\u2019re going out this way.\\u201d I watch them and am thinking, \\u201cOh my god! They\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d They\\u2019re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fun House\\u201d We are at a carnival. It\\u2019s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I\\u2019m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don\\u2019t really want to because I know they aren\\u2019t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they\\u2019re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she\\u2019s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that\\u2019s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I\\u2019ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They\\u2019re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She\\u2019s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it\\u2019s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We\\u2019re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there\\u2019s a door. It brings us into something we\\u2019re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We\\u2019re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don\\u2019t have the shoes on because I\\u2019m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they\\u2019re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn\\u2019t make me put the shoes on. I\\u2019m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she\\u2019s glaring at me, I also retort, \\u201cWould I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.\\u201d I think I said Christian, but I can\\u2019t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she\\u2019s moved back and I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good. Maybe she won\\u2019t bother me anymore.\\u201d On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a window, but it\\u2019s close to the ground - it\\u2019s a crawlspace. She\\u2019s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She\\u2019s looking at something on the other side. I don\\u2019t feel like crawling there. I can see that she\\u2019s jumping up and down. She\\u2019s excited about what she sees, so I\\u2019m content to sit on the other side and wait until she\\u2019s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it\\u2019s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she\\u2019s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It\\u2019s dark. We don\\u2019t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it\\u2019s dissonant. It\\u2019s really unpleasant. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.\\u201d So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it\\u2019s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he\\u2019s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She\\u2019s a naturopath. She\\u2019s there with Trisha. i wonder what they\\u2019re doing because the carnival doesn\\u2019t seem like their thing. I\\u2019m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d Instead of staying on the ground, we\\u2019re suddenly transported upwards a little. I\\u2019d say we\\u2019re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They\\u2019re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they\\u2019re ants and they\\u2019re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He\\u2019s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he\\u2019s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn\\u2019t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Airport\\u201d We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I\\u2019m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I\\u2019ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian\\u2019s house and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we\\u2019ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it\\u2019s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She\\u2019s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn\\u2019t hungry and it\\u2019s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she\\u2019s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she\\u2019s done this in a bowl before she\\u2019s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband\\u2019sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it\\u2019s like glue. Some of it\\u2019s hard and some is still soft. It\\u2019s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don\\u2019t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, \\u201ceww,\\u201d when I\\u2019m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She\\u2019s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, \\u201cWhat time did the tickets say we\\u2019re supposed to be there?\\u201d She says, \\u201c5 o\\u2019clock in the morning.\\u201d But she says it in metric first, but we don\\u2019t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, \\u201cAre you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o\\u2019clock.\\u201d So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o\\u2019clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it\\u2019s almost that time. He\\u2019s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he\\u2019s getting his clothes on and I\\u2019m putting things into the suitcase. We\\u2019re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, \\u201cNope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.\\u201d Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, \\u201cOh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I\\u2019ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We\\u2019ll still be there in lots of time.\\u201d Her husband says no, I don\\u2019t want you to do that. Besides, we\\u2019re just going into the US and you don\\u2019t need passports anymore.\\u201d But I tell them, \\u201cEvery time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.\\u201d He gets out a piece of paper that\\u2019s attached to the back of his driver\\u2019s license. He says, \\u201cHere, read the fine print.\\u201d I read down and it says it\\u2019s fine to go on with just a driver\\u2019s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver\\u2019s license with me. I say, \\u201cBut my son doesn\\u2019t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, \\u201cWell now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.\\u201d But he won\\u2019t let us go. He tells us all it\\u2019s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They\\u2019re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don\\u2019t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn\\u2019t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We\\u2019re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don\\u2019t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I\\u2019m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don\\u2019t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she\\u2019s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re over at Gate such and such.\\u201d So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they\\u2019ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that\\u2019s great, although I\\u2019m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don\\u2019t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Birthday Party\\u201d I\\u2019m at a house and the occasion is my friend\\u2019s birthday. She\\u2019s 50 on this birthday, although I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s her real age. It\\u2019s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don\\u2019t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I\\u2019m looking for someone I know. I\\u2019m reluctant to go into the house. I\\u2019ve arrived there with my son. He\\u2019s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don\\u2019t know. I have an eye on him. He\\u2019s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I\\u2019m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I\\u2019m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn\\u2019t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He\\u2019s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they\\u2019ve seen him. They say, \\u201cYes, he went down that hallway.\\u201d They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He\\u2019s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he\\u2019ll get dressed and I tell him we\\u2019re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he\\u2019s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It\\u2019s not about anything I care to converse about. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are we wearing today\\u201d - flat and doesn\\u2019t feel meaningful. I sit with them for a few minutes and then go back to the washroom where my son is. He\\u2019s dressed now. I take him by the hand and we start walking down the hallway and out. I notice for the whole duration of this dream, my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. As we\\u2019re leaving her house, I see a pair of plastic shorts. They\\u2019re kind of long - they go almost down to the top of the knee. There\\u2019s a perforated line where you can rip off the last 4 inches and make them into a normal length pair of shorts. For some reason, I pick them up and I do this. I fold at the perforated line and rip off the bottom 4 inches. Then I roll them up and am looking for a bag to put them in. I notice there\\u2019s a tag on them that says Size 10. I think, \\u201cWhose are these?\\u201d Then I\\u2019m looking for my friend to give them to. I look down in my hand and suddenly I also have a birthday card. Now I feel surprised that I appear to have picked up something in her house that doesn\\u2019t belong to me - a pair of transparent plastic shorts - and now I\\u2019m going to give them to her. I don\\u2019t want to because I feel like I haven\\u2019t purchased this fairly; I\\u2019ve just picked them up and taken them. It\\u2019s not even something I would give to her. I\\u2019m looking for a place to set these down. They just disappear out of my hand. Now I\\u2019m with my son on the outside of the house. I take him by the hand and we continue on our walk. We go all the way around the block - it\\u2019s a nice walk. When we come back, there are still all these people I don\\u2019t know. I feel like I don\\u2019t belong there. I\\u2019m relieved to see her husband isn\\u2019t there. She\\u2019s sitting on the porch. I go up to tell her we\\u2019re going and maybe I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow when there aren\\u2019t so many people around. She smiles at me. I smile back. I get in the car with my son and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Curio Shop\\u201d My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I\\u2019m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It\\u2019s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can\\u2019t even see what\\u2019s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don\\u2019t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We\\u2019re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They\\u2019re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we\\u2019ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It\\u2019s purple, but it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s blue. It\\u2019s got fur all over. The fur doesn\\u2019t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there\\u2019s this creature in the store and my son\\u2019s got him. I don\\u2019t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they\\u2019re half off, they\\u2019re still really expensive and I don\\u2019t think I need a spoon that badly. I don\\u2019t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I\\u2019m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s this one.\\u201d I still think it\\u2019s expensive and say I don\\u2019t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my son?\\u201d One of the male shopkeepers says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to follow me.\\u201d So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d and it just bursts out of my body. I\\u2019m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it\\u2019s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I\\u2019m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that\\u2019s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, \\u201cNo way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!\\u201d So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, \\u201cRun! We have to get out of here!\\u201d So we start running. I don\\u2019t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We\\u2019re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can\\u2019t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s go in there. There are other people.\\u201d The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, \\u201cLet\\u2019s change our clothes, \\u201c so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He\\u2019s right there. I tell him, \\u201cYour partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can\\u2019t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.\\u201d He\\u2019s not helpful. In fact, he\\u2019s in league with the other one. So now we\\u2019re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can\\u2019t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got my son! You\\u2019re holding him and I want him back.\\u201d Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, \\u201cFine fine, okay!\\u201d He writes this phone number down. I say, \\u201cA phone number?! Are you kidding me?!\\u201d I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I\\u2019ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I\\u2019m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It\\u2019s a 10-digit number. Now I\\u2019ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It\\u2019s like 164576476470, like that. The 4\\u2019s and 7\\u2019s won\\u2019t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I\\u2019m sobbing and saying, \\u201cJust tell me where he is. Just go get him.\\u201d One of them says he\\u2019s in the basement. \\u201cThe basement of this building?!\\u201d I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m trying to get back into the dream, but I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scaffold\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of childcare setting. I\\u2019ve applied to work there. The dream opens up on what I think is my first day of work. So I walk into a classroom. There are maybe 13 to 15 kids and they look to be around an early school age, like 5 or 6 years old. There are two teachers attending them. As soon as I arrive in the room, they leave. I think, \\u201cWow, way to throw me into this.\\u201d But within a few minutes, another teacher comes in and she introduces herself. She tells me she's there to train me. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good then because that was my understanding.\\u201d She starts describing the curriculum to me and giving me a little bit of information about each child. I\\u2019m taking this in and feeling that sounds familiar, as I\\u2019ve worked in this kind of educational setting before. We start to collect what we\\u2019ve done with the kids up and tell them it\\u2019s time to put their things away and get ready to go outside for outdoor time. The kids start going out the door. There\\u2019s something out in the playground. It\\u2019s really, really large. It\\u2019s large enough that it\\u2019s leaving a shadow on the window of the classroom. I can\\u2019t see how high up it goes. It\\u2019s quite looming. There are some men on it who are working on it, too. It has the feel of one of those scaffolds that construction sites have where you climb up and up and up to work on something at the top. It\\u2019s a safe platform for people as opposed to a ladder, which is not very safe and kind of flimsy. So there are a few men on this and they\\u2019re busy with it. I do note (not in my dream, but after waking), one of the men is black. There are also some plants that are starting to overgrow the bottom of whatever structure this is. They\\u2019re moving from this structure into the building. So while the person who is training me is supervising the playground, I am trying to moveis plant that is starting to grow inside the door of the classroom. It feels really strong in my hands. When I pick it up, it\\u2019s like a vine and fits into the palm of my hand like a rope that\\u2019s about 1 inch in diameter. Every time I try to move it away from the door, it just grows back. I\\u2019m doing this the whole time during playground time. The teacher and kids start to come back in the room now because outdoor time is over. We\\u2019re setting up for the after outdoor time curriculum. I feel that I\\u2019m starting to get sick. So, I get a paper towel from the wall, put it over my mouth and I get sick into it. I notice that the vmit is all blood colored, although it\\u2019s not blood. It\\u2019s like food or something like food. Then I put it in the garbage. I start to do something else, I feel myself getting sick again, so same thing - paper towel off the wall, vomit, put it into the garbage. I go to the sink in the classroom. I wash my hands, I wash my face. I come back to what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I am facilitating an activity at one of the tables. I\\u2019m only doing that for a few minutes when I get sick again. So I\\u2019m trying to hide this now because it\\u2019s my first day on the job and I\\u2019m training. I just want to finish out the day. I\\u2019m not feeling overly sick in my body. It\\u2019s just that this keeps happening. I keep vomiting. I keep throwing the paper towel out and then I\\u2019m fine. So I\\u2019m doing this until there\\u2019s another woman who comes into the room. Now I notice that the classroom has two sides. The other side is completely empty. There is no curriculum going on there, no teachers, no students. When this other woman comes in, she says to me: \\u201cHow are you doing on your first day?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh fine, I\\u2019m completely comfortable with this.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s good because I hired you to run the senior school program in this other side of the building. We\\u2019ve lost our teacher and that\\u2019s really what I had earmarked for you.\\u201d I feel a little bit surprised about this because I thought I was going to be hired to team teach with someone and I was really looking forward to team teaching. But, if that\\u2019s the job, then I\\u2019m not going to turn it down. So I ask her how much longer I have for training. She says, \\u201cAnother week or two. You let me know when you\\u2019re comfortable.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell okay, that\\u2019s good then.\\u201d But as we\\u2019re talking, I feel another urge to be sick. So I take another paper towel off the wall and I\\u2019m 06sick into it. I surreptitiously wipe my mouth and put it in the garbage. I do this several times while she\\u2019s showing me around the empty classroom and describing what she wants to have go on in there. Then she looks at me and says, \\u201cAre you being sick?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, I am.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s interesting. You\\u2019re not the only person who has been sick here. We\\u2019ve lost several teachers to the same thing.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHuh, because to me it seems that every time I touch that plant, \\u201c and I indicate the one that keeps trying to overgrow through the door and into the windows, \\u201cI get sick after. I wasn\\u2019t sick before I got here.\\u201d I wasn't sick before I arrived.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Vegetable Garden\\u201d I\\u2019m in the backyard of the house I grew up in. I\\u2019m maybe about 20 years old, possibly a little bit younger. I\\u2019m with my dad. He\\u2019s teaching me how to grow a6 vegetable garden. The plot is quite large. There\\u2019s room for enough vegetables that will have to be kept over the winter. It will definitely feed maybe 6-8 people for a whole year. It's planned out quite meticulously with companion planting as well as staggered planting so that you don\\u2019t get a bumper crop of the same thing all at once. There\\u2019s corn and cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, rhubarb, and herbs; and marigolds and chrysanthemums around the outside as a natural insecticide. Once it gets planted, which is quite a lengthy process, then we have to go back in and set up structures that will support the things as they grow upwards. There is something that looks like it\\u2019s for tomatoes, but it\\u2019s not in the tomato row. It\\u2019s suspended and there\\u2019s little baskets. I can\\u2019t figure out how it\\u2019s suspended because there\\u2019s nothing above it except sky. Then when I look at it, there are bits of other vegetables in it. I can see that there are pieces of cauliflower, so I\\u2019m puzzling over this. It also spins. There are about four of these on a long bar. I ask my dad what it is. He keeps appearing. Although I\\u2019ve done this all by myself, whenever I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing, my dad just appears for guidance. While I\\u2019m puzzling over this, suddenly he is there again. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this for?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe vegetables on it are composting. The gas they emit is good for the atmosphere that the other vegetables are growing in. It\\u2019s like a Natural Miracle Grower.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh. Hmm, I didn't think methane was good to be near people.\\u201d So I get this garden going. There\\u2019s also another part where I\\u2019m fertilizing or something. It\\u2019s like an extension of the natural compost where I\\u2019m taking some of the pieces from the plants - like when you prune or something starts to grow and the bugs have gotten it and it\\u2019s no good. I\\u2019m grating it up almost like a food processor. I\\u2019m putting it into cheesecloth and leaving the cheesecloth in various places in the garden. At one point my dad comes in and says to me, \\u201cBe careful with this one that no one eats it. It was too close to your body when you broke it down into tiny pieces.\\u201d It\\u2019s almost like I put it through a food processor. But I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve got on my body that\\u2019s doing this to it. It\\u2019s some unknown thing. He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t let people eat this. You have to put it back into the ground. Make sure you put it back in the ground.\\u201d It\\u2019s like it was in my body and my body did the breaking down of it. So now the garden is in a state where I can just wait for things to start producing. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m at some kind of setting that feels like my paternal grandparents\\u2019 party. The house isn\\u2019t there, though. It looks like it geographically. There\\u2019s a building and people live in the building. There\\u2019s an orchard growing lengthwise from the building. Sometimes people plant orchards around the building where they live, but this one extends laterally. There\\u2019s all this empty grass - it\\u2019s like a wild meadow. I\\u2019m inside the building. The woman I\\u2019m speaking with is in charge of the building and the people who live there. She\\u2019s asked me to come and advise on a vegetable garden for her community. I tell her that it's already almost the end of June and there isn\\u2019t enough growing time to plant the kind of garden she wants. She wants one similar to the one I have that is already well underway at my own place. She\\u2019s insisting though. So I have to debate the point and explain it further, because she really doesn\\u2019t understand that by the time September comes or even if the growing season gives her until October, she\\u2019s going to have a whole bunch of plants, but no fruit or vegetables because they don't have enough time to germinate now in this type of weather. I do manage to convince her by saying, \\u201cHowever, this doesn\\u2019t mean there is nothing you can do this year. So what needs to be done is the grass and what you\\u2019ve got growing on the land for the vegetables needs to be removed. It can be aerated - tilled up. And there are a few things you can plant in long rows that have a short germination period. It will help to get everyone we\\u2019re training to be gardeners used to it this year.\\u201d So she agrees to that. So she says, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to get some people to help.\\u201d I see her doing this. Now I\\u2019m standing at a thing you leaned on at a reception counter, but it\\u2019s not. There are people who live there or staff that occasionally come out of a door behind that and then go back in. I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing. It\\u2019s not food service. So she\\u2019s standing behind there and as people come out the door, she\\u2019s asking them if they want to be part of the vegetable garden and they\\u2019re all saying no. I think, \\u201cHmm, this isn\\u2019t going to go very well here in the way she\\u2019s presenting it.\\u201d I leave her to that and step off a bit to the side. There are a couple of other women that have a box. It\\u2019s got wallets in it that look handmade with carvings and are beautifully painted. There are some people, one of which is one of my YTT students. They\\u2019ve ordered wallets and are waiting to pick them up. One of them says to me, \\u201cLook, aren\\u2019t these beautiful?\\u201d She\\u2019s matching it with a matching hat and clothes she has on - indigo blues, pink and white. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s really beautifully color coordinated.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t want to look in the box because I don't have any money and I don\\u2019t need a wallet to carry my money in. I also don\\u2019t want to spend my money on something I don\\u2019t need anyway. I make the comment to the person selling them that they are quite beautiful. Then I move away from that area. I go back to the lady and ask if she has any recruits for the garden. She says, \\u201cNot yet.\\u201d then someone comes out and the woman herself looks really downcast and defeated. I see the first woman, the one who is in charge, and instead of asking her if she wants to be part of this project, she tells her she has to. The person she says this to is every resigned. I think this whole presentation of community gardening is not going to work with this kind of asking without describing what it can do for them, or making it an order. So what I do is just leave the building. I walk to the area that will be used. I\\u2019m using my hands to pull up the grasses in a long straight line. The orchard trees on my left. I\\u2019m backing up with my body as I do this with my hands. One other person comes out - it\\u2019s the person who was ordered. I just allow her to watch as I do this. I do one long row of taking the grasses out. I'm doing it very slowly. The soil feels very fertile. It\\u2019s not hard. I can reach my fingers in and squish the soil. It\\u2019s dark and smells like earth. I know that whatever is grown here will eventually grow really well. I notice as my row is going very well, the other lady has just started and she\\u2019s mimicking what I\\u2019ve done. She\\u2019s doing it on her own and I just allow her to do that. The scene changes and it\\u2019s later. I\\u2019m just gazing at what I\\u2019ve planted. I think it\\u2019s radishes - they do germinate rather quickly. There\\u2019s a long row and they look really good.\"],[\"\\u201cJack\\u201d This is just a snippet. I am with my daughter and some other person that\\u2019s male - I think it might be Kenny - and Jack who is a friend of mine that I\\u2019ve had since elementary school and I still keep in contact with him. We\\u2019re supposed to be picking Jack up because he\\u2019s agreed to help us with something. He keeps not being where he said he would be. So the three of us are running around from spot to spot looking for him. It\\u2019s an urban setting and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are very slushy and it\\u2019s hard to get through. We\\u2019re muddy. As we get to checkpoints where we\\u2019re supposed to meet him, he\\u2019s not there. Now I\\u2019m not with my daughter. I don\\u2019t know what happened to her. In fact, Jack is supposed to be looking after her. It\\u2019s muddy what his responsibilities are and if he\\u2019s actually looking after them. The other two people are going through these convolutedWell, we don\\u2019t have his phone number.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well I do.\\u201d So I get out my cell phone and I look. Someone has changed his last name, but I know it\\u2019s his number because I know where it is in my contacts. When I press his number, what comes up is not his name, but something completely different that starts with D-H-L and then this other name. I think, \\u201cThat\\u2019s odd. How can anybody have done this in my phone?\\u201d Then I look over and I see him, but he looks like he\\u2019s sleeping. He\\u2019s oblivious to his surroundings. As I walk over to say hey what's up, he disappears. Then I go back to the other two people. We\\u2019ve been looking for him because he\\u2019s supposed to be doing something with us. I\\u2019m trying to explain that I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on here and something is going on with my phone and he\\u2019s illusive.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fortune Teller\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It\\u2019s summer. It\\u2019s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It\\u2019s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I\\u2019m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I\\u2019m with some friends. I can\\u2019t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt. She\\u2019s in the boat that I\\u2019m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She\\u2019s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I\\u2019ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who\\u2019s driving the boat is not me. It\\u2019s a motorboat - something I don\\u2019t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I\\u2019m hazy on one that is - it\\u2019s not water skiing, it\\u2019s not floating, I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we\\u2019re staying. I guess I\\u2019m in a motel because it\\u2019s on the ground. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I\\u2019m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It\\u2019s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it\\u2019s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There\\u2019s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it\\u2019s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I\\u2019ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there\\u2019s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They\\u2019ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that\\u2019s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she\\u2019s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she\\u2019s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she\\u2019s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that\\u2019s complete. So they\\u2019re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life\\u2019s purpose. I\\u2019m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I\\u2019m really surprised that she\\u2019s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there\\u2019s somebody ahead of me. I don\\u2019t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don\\u2019t go in with her and I haven\\u2019t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she\\u2019s advertised. I don\\u2019t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She\\u2019s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She\\u2019s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she\\u2019s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they\\u2019re laughing like, \\u201cWow! I can\\u2019t imagine myself doing this!\\u201d Or \\u201cI\\u2019m so surprised at what she said!\\u201d These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They\\u2019re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it\\u2019s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it\\u2019s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren\\u2019t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I\\u2019m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She\\u2019s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It\\u2019s a woman I know. I\\u2019m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life\\u2019s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there\\u2019s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she\\u2019s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives. She says, \\u201cWow I\\u2019ve made $350 doing this.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a \\u201cwho knew?!\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou are making this up?\\u201d She\\u2019s speaking as though she\\u2019s making it up. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGrandpa T\\u201d I\\u2019m in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house on North Shore Blvd. I seem to spend a lot of time there alone, wandering around from room to room. It\\u2019s a really big house. The odd thing is that my grandparents are sleeping in the room I always slept in when I was there and I am sleeping in their room. But this one particular day, I get up in the middle of the night and they\\u2019re still sleeping. I walk down the long hallway into the kitchen. I just sit there. There was never a table in the middle of the kitchen in real life, but there is in my dream. I sit down at it. I feel like there is the presence or essence of other people coming in and out of the kitchen. I\\u2019m just sitting there feeling into them. I notice the dynamic between them in a way I never did when I was a child in that house. I\\u2019m noticing personalities and why they act the way they do. I spend a few hours doing this in the kitchen. Then I get up from the table and go over to see if there is anything on the stove. I make sure all the burners are off. Then I walk down the hallway into the room my grandparents used to sleep in. I get into the bed and lie there for a while awake. As I\\u2019m lying there, my consciousness wanders out the sliding patio doors into the grounds that are around the house. I notice that there\\u2019s a musty smell I\\u2019ve never noticed before. It\\u2019s coming from what would have been the east side of the grounds. There\\u2019s some soggy area - a bit of marsh - that I\\u2019ve also never noticed before. I attribute that to the musty smell. Then my consciousness goes down to the boat house. I feel this mixture of fear at how big it seems to me or that it doesn\\u2019t seem big on the outside, but on the inside it yawns back into the ground. There\\u2019s this big boat in there that doesn\\u2019t seem like it would possibly fit when you look at the boat house from the outside. The discrepancy between what it appears to be on the outside and what it actually houses on the inside is what gives me that little bit of fear. My consciousness comes back around up to the top where there is a greenhouse. I notice that it was barely ever used. There are a few remnants of plant pots and projects that were started and never finished. Then I go over to the sunroom, which is outside, and I sit there. It\\u2019s still nighttime. There\\u2019s the sense of disuse there as well. I also feel like there\\u2019s some leftover bits of gatherings. I think, \\u201cWell, at least this got some use.\\u201d Then as I\\u2019m sending there, I notice my grandfather is beside me, sitting on another chair. He\\u2019s complaining about why it takes my grandmother so long to do everything. I lean over and pat him on the arm the way a parent would. I say, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s because you\\u2019re so picky. If you weren\\u2019t so focused on details all the time, she wouldn\\u2019t take so much time trying to fulfill them for you.\\u201d He sits back in his chair and appears to be thinking about this. He\\u2019s considering it. I leave him there and go back into the house. I go through the living room, through the hallway, and down the stairs to the basement. There are a lot of things piled up in there. I consider that they\\u2019ve never really gotten rid of the stuff that their own kids left behind when they moved out. I\\u2019m thinking and wondering why this is - what sense of something seemed to stop and not move on for them. My feet feel the cold of the floor and notice it\\u2019s marble. I think, \\u201cWow, a lot of the materials used in this house are very expensive.\\u201d The room has a fireplace at one end. I remember as a kid being allowed to create a fire there but there was no arrangement of chairs around it or of it ever being used by people sitting around the fireplace and just gazing at the fire. I feel a little bit sad at how the basement isn\\u2019t a lived in space. It\\u2019s more a storage place for memories that aren\\u2019t really integrated into life. So I go back up the stairs into the living room. I sit in one of the charis and notice that there is a rectangle in the wall. It looks like it has a little door in it and I\\u2019ve never noticed it before. It\\u2019s very tiny - probably about 6x4 inches. I open it up and there\\u2019s a key inside. I\\u2019m sitting there with a key in my hand. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy would somebody go to the trouble of disguising this passageway into the inner walls and not lock it and just leave a key in it?\\u201d The key has some meaning, and I\\u2019m wondering what it is. As I\\u2019m sitting in the chair, my grandmother comes and sits beside me. She says to me, \\u201cYou know one of my favorite things about this chair is?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt opens up to a bed.\\u201d It\\u2019s a single chair. She shows me how you can push it back like a recliner. The part you are leaning on flops out once. The part where your legs are flops out. A person can sleep comfortably there overnight. I say, \\u201cOh, that is a really good idea.\\u201d I tell her that my space is very, very small. I indicate from the end table over to one couch. Then I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s how big my entire living room is.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well that couch pulls out into a bed, too. If you had these two pieces of furniture, you could double the size of your space because then you wouldn\\u2019t need one of your bedrooms.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a really clever idea. Then she walks away down the hall and goes back to the bedroom. I just sit there in the living room. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much of my grandmother is there actually in this space?\\u201d I wonder if she was ever able to use her brilliant mind that I knew her to have beyond the house. In my dream, I feel some anger directed to my grandfather. It\\u2019s like it comes out of my body in a concentrated shot towards him. Then after it does, I feel bad because he\\u2019s a nice man. Then he appears beside me in the chair in the living room that my grandmother was sitting in. I can tell from his demeanor that he\\u2019s not upset with me at all. He has felt my anger, but it\\u2019s not something he\\u2019s ever felt against himself at one point. We sit there in companionable silence. I leave him there and go back to the bedroom and get in bed.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Inner City\\u201d In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It\\u2019s really hot. There\\u2019s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I\\u2019m inside a building. It\\u2019s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I\\u2019m helping people. I don\\u2019t know the people I\\u2019m working with. So I\\u2019m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It\\u2019s really oddly shaped. It\\u2019s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It\\u2019s covered with sticky potato. I think it\\u2019s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there\\u2019s this big hose thing that\\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. It\\u2019s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I\\u2019m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there\\u2019s a sieve thing on it. I\\u2019m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they\\u2019re moving really fast. They\\u2019re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She\\u2019s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I\\u2019m helping. I feel like she\\u2019s centered me out as though I\\u2019m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn\\u2019t up to par. It\\u2019s a whole demeanor like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to watch you even closer.\\u201d She\\u2019s making me nervous now. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I\\u2019m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They\\u2019re trying to speed up and they\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can\\u2019t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There\\u2019s a ramp and there\\u2019s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I\\u2019ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I\\u2019m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don\\u2019t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I\\u2019m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They\\u2019re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She\\u2019s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there\\u2019s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t she put the bigger rock that\\u2019s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?\\u201d Now I notice that she\\u2019s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she\\u2019s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She\\u2019s calling the thigh bone a \\u201cfemoris\\u201d but in a sing-song type voice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cUh, no!\\u201d But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, \\u201cI wonder if they knew she was in there?\\u201d I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We\\u2019re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There\\u2019s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we\\u2019re instructed to sit back into child\\u2019s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It\\u2019s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I\\u2019m stretching and there\\u2019s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don\\u2019t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I\\u2019m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I\\u2019m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I\\u2019m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I\\u2019m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone\\u2019s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I\\u2019m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.\"],[\"Unfortunately, the details have faded a bit, but I don\\u2019t want them to slide completely away. This setting has become recurring now. I\\u2019m in a town and the only reason I go there is to teach at the Yoga Studio. This is the real life part of this dream. There are street vendors outside of the Yoga Studio door. The street is really long. There are all kinds of stores and vendors. I stop after walking a long time. I\\u2019m standing in front of one of the stores and it\\u2019s some kind of curio shop. I talk to three vendors and I\\u2019m not sure if they all own the store or if one of them is friends with the people who own it and they\\u2019re just sitting together and chatting. I chat with them for a bit then enter the store. The store is dark and dusty. It\\u2019s like there is a window somewhere because the lighting is natural, but it\\u2019s as though the light is coming through a really dirty window. So it\\u2019s dim inside, but I know there isn\\u2019t an artificial fluorescent source of light. There are so many things inside and they are stacked in front of the window, so it\\u2019s hard to see. I stand and wait until my eyes adjust a little bit. I\\u2019m trying to see what are all these things. I can\\u2019t really identify anything. They are objects, possibly books, a combination of both. Nothing really stands out as a single object or book. I walk around the store. There\\u2019s a part of me that likes that musty smell of history. Even though I can\\u2019t discern what the things are, I actually like being in this store. I\\u2019m not there to buy anything. I\\u2019m simply curious. I stay in there for a bit. There\\u2019s a feeling of comfort. Eventually, I exit the store. I\\u2019m standing out on the street again. I see some people I know who I have taught at the Yoga Studio. They\\u2019re heading towards the studio. I\\u2019m thinking to myself: \\u201cOh, was I supposed to teach?\\u201d I didn\\u2019t realize the studio had reopened. I enter the studio and people are leaving as though a class has just finished. I\\u2019m noticing that some of them have showered. I think to myself: \\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize we had a shower either.\\u201d It\\u2019s crossing my mind that so much has changed since I taught there. I\\u2019m remembering that I\\u2019ve been here before in a dream, but I was locked out. I\\u2019m feeling this time that I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m not. I have a few conversations with people there - one at the desk, one with someone who is just leaving, and another I can\\u2019t remember. I exit the studio and go back to the street.\"],[\"\\u201cKeep it Small\\u201d There\\u2019s some kind of outdoor grouping. There\\u2019s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I\\u2019m not there to particularly attend. It\\u2019s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I\\u2019m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son\\u2019s friend\\u2019s moms, Melissa. She\\u2019s Noah\\u2019s mom. She\\u2019s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: \\u201cHere are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don\\u2019t react.\\u201d The lecturer doesn\\u2019t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, \\u201cAnd this is how you can keep it out of your face.\\u201d I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn\\u2019t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I\\u2019m asking her: \\u201cAre you buying into this? What do you think?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for some time now.\\u201d She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn\\u2019t had any \\u201caction\\u201d in quite a few months. I say, \\u201cWell, maybe that\\u2019s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you\\u2019re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That\\u2019s a good thing!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She\\u2019s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn\\u2019t anything to be outrageously happy about. I\\u2019m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that\\u2019s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn\\u2019t be able to pull so many people into this. It\\u2019s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it\\u2019s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I\\u2019m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I\\u2019m at home. I\\u2019m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it\\u2019s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I\\u2019m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I\\u2019m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I\\u2019m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I\\u2019ve got orange and blue in there now. I\\u2019m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.\"],[\"\\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d This dream begins with me driving through the town I lived in with my biological mother. I\\u2019m making a circle around the downtown area. I\\u2019ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I\\u2019m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I\\u2019m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I\\u2019m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, \\u201cThere was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I\\u2019ve seen those exact roots.\\u201d When I\\u2019m saying \\u201croots\\u201d I\\u2019m picturing old brick at the bottom that I\\u2019ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn\\u2019t so. I just walk away because I know there\\u2019s no point arguing with somebody who doesn\\u2019t know anything and who\\u2019s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they\\u2019re hungry because we\\u2019ve been walking around and it\\u2019s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I\\u2019m making up something I call \\u201cSurvival Juice.\\u201d I\\u2019ve got these big glass carboys (jugs). I\\u2019m putting a lot of roots into them - some I chop first and some I just stuff down through the hole at the top. It\\u2019s a cloudy light beige color liquid. I simply describe it as \\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d - it\\u2019s a medicinal mixture I\\u2019ve made that is going to help us get through what we\\u2019re going through right now. I hand out a cup of it to each of my kids as well as the people at the restaurant.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bubble Gum Pipe\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room and people I used to work with at a restaurant while at university are gathered in this room. They\\u2019re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They\\u2019re there, too. At first I don\\u2019t notice them because they\\u2019re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we\\u2019re in this other place. They have a baby. I\\u2019m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we\\u2019re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I\\u2019m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I\\u2019m watching the skaters. I\\u2019m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She\\u2019s got a platter in her hands. It\\u2019s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She\\u2019s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It\\u2019s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she\\u2019s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I\\u2019m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don\\u2019t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don\\u2019t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: \\u201cFreya, get over here. I\\u2019ve got one for you.\\u201d So I start to walk closer to her. But I\\u2019m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it\\u2019s warm and there\\u2019s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI heat it up with taffy first.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don\\u2019t want it in my mouth. She says, \\u201cCome on. You\\u2019re coming with us.\\u201d I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, \\u201cMy dad, I need to let him know where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. He\\u2019ll be okay for a bit.\\u201d I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go see my mom and dad.\\u201d We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We\\u2019re almost at her parents\\u2019 place. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He\\u2019s going to be worried about me.\\u201d I look down and say, \\u201cOh we don\\u2019t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can\\u2019t even call him.\\u201d She says to me, \\u201cYour dad was crying when I saw him. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d Then I get more distraught. She says, \\u201cHe knows where my parents live. He\\u2019ll know where to come get you.\\u201d I think that he won\\u2019t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, \\u201cHow did we get all the way over here?!\\u201d Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman\\u2019s house. I think, \\u201cHow is this truck even making it down the side because it\\u2019s so steep?\\u201d It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I\\u2019m not going to get to my dad in time. He\\u2019s going to be gone by the time I get there because this is taking so very long. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Accident\\u201d I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There\\u2019s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There\\u2019s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it\\u2019s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There\\u2019s an image of Ken. He\\u2019s raking or something - he\\u2019s doing something to the land. I feel like I\\u2019ve just finished doing what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There\\u2019s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There\\u2019s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. I\\u2019m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I\\u2019m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it\\u2019s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she\\u2019s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I\\u2019m starting to become aware of the room I\\u2019m in. I can\\u2019t move my body. I feel like I don\\u2019t remember what happened. I see Ken. He\\u2019s in the room. He says, \\u201cYou were in an accident.\\u201d He leaves. I\\u2019m in this room in the hospital. I don\\u2019t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can\\u2019t touch my face. Ken\\u2019s wife says to me: \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay.\\u201d I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can\\u2019t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo. Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.\\u201d The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re so far away I can\\u2019t identify them. I\\u2019m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, why shouldn\\u2019t I be doing this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, this is where you had that accident.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t say anything else. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m supposed to remember something or if I\\u2019m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can\\u2019t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I\\u2019m bobbing around and thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s funny. I don\\u2019t think I know how to swim.\\u201d Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the house. I\\u2019m in a bed. Ken\\u2019s wife is standing over me and says, \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThe water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?\\u201d I feel around my face with my fingers and there\\u2019s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, just rest.\\u201d She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, \\u201cI thought we weren\\u2019t supposed to tell her.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.\\u201d I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There\\u2019s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s about time somebody told me what really happened before.\\u201d This time Ken answers. He says, \\u201cOkay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.\\u201d Then, before I wake up, I\\u2019m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I\\u2019m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Gym\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big gymnasium. It\\u2019s so crowded I can\\u2019t see anything. I can\\u2019t see the floor or the equipment. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in a few hours. I go outside the building to get some air. I notice that I\\u2019m really depressed. I was depressed in the gym. I\\u2019m depressed outside. I feel detached from all the people around me. I don\\u2019t want to be there. The air is dusty and feels dirty. Then my brother swings by to where I\\u2019m standing. He asks if I can help him out for a few minutes. I say, \\u201cWell I have to be back here at 7 to teach.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine. We\\u2019ll be back in plenty of time.\\u201d I get in the car with him. Immediately, it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s driving with this really rash intent to get somewhere really quickly. I feel the car is moving more quickly than is safe. Immediately he goes right onto a 7-lane highway. He races over and we stop at a gas station parking lot and there\\u2019s a trailer. He asks me if I will hook the trailer to the ball and hitch at the back of the car. I say, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I get out of the car. I pick up the end of the trailer with the female end. I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder if I can lift this without him.\\u201d It lifts really easily and I think it\\u2019s odd because it should be heavier than this. As I go to attach it to the male end at the back of the car, I notice both ends are made of plastic and realize that\\u2019s why it felt too light. As I set the female part on top of the male part, there\\u2019s a little cap that\\u2019s not quite big enough to reach over the top of the ball. There\\u2019s no resounding click when it makes contact. There\\u2019s no side pinions that go down through the top to the bottom like there normally would be. Of course, they would have been made of metal, but they\\u2019re not. As I\\u2019m doing this, I\\u2019m picturing the metal one and what the parts and pieces would look like. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no. This is not good.\\u201d I yell into my brother, \\u201cDo you know this is made of plastic?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes. It will be fine. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I detach and reattach it a couple of times. I tug on it with my hands. I\\u2019m still really dubious about this. He keeps telling me, \\u201cCome on, we have to go.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell okay, he must have done this before because he moves a lot of things with trailers, so I guess I\\u2019m just going to have to trust him.\\u201d I get back in the car. He starts to take off. I notice that the trailer isn\\u2019t attached and I tell him this. He stops and tells me to go back out, pull the trailer back up and reattach it. I\\u2019m still saying, \\u201cThe whole thing is plastic. This isn\\u2019t going to stay on your car when you\\u2019re speeding on the highway.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes it will.\\u201d I get out and do what he asks me to do - pull the trailer back on, pull the flimsy cap back over. I get back in the car and this time it actually says. He zooms on the highway. We pull off on the other side to this industrial air. The dusty dirty air now has grease molecules in it. It smells like petroleum. I stay in the car. He gets out and quickly loads something onto the trailer. He turns the car and trailer around, and sometimes it stays attached. Now it has heavy things in it. But we zoom back to the highway and zoom back to the gym where he drops me off. I have ten minutes before I have to teach. Luckily, the people have started to leave, so there\\u2019s a window before the other people arrive for what I\\u2019m teaching. I see what they have for equipment. I\\u2019m teaching Pilates. I see they have the thicker mats stacked up and the bender balls you squeeze. I tell the people waiting for the class to get a mat and a ball and set themselves up. I have five minutes until class starts. I walk across to the storeroom to see what they\\u2019ve got. I find those rubber resistance bands and gliders for moving planks. I think that\\u2019s good for next time and I\\u2019ll just go with the bender balls and thick mats because it\\u2019s only a half hour class. I go back out. People are set up on their mats. Other people have come in and set up stationary bikes between the mats. I\\u2019m thinking that this is not safe. I look around and there are so many people that I can\\u2019t see who's in charge. I can\\u2019t see the clock, either. I just start my class. I take them into one series of exercises. Everybody is responding super super slowly. The bicycle people keep getting in the way. I look at the clock and my class is over already, but we haven\\u2019t even done anything. This brings that really heavy depressed, pointless, going nowhere dejection back into my body again. The people stack their mats on the side. There\\u2019s no interaction between the students and me. They\\u2019re like zombies. I\\u2019m going back to the storeroom to put the equipment away. There is a mirror and I look at myself. My face was infected with pus on the forehead, under my left eye, on my left cheekbone, and from the top of the left side of my forehead across to the middle. I\\u2019m looking for something to soak up the pus. I can\\u2019t find anything. Then I go back out. This other instructor who normally teaches yoga is trying to teach the people on the stationary bikes to do yoga on top of the bikes. I just wonder what\\u2019s wrong with everything. I don\\u2019t like this environment and don\\u2019t want to be part of it.\"],[\"\\u201cOuiglio and The Dog that Moves Sideways\\u201d I am in a car. I\\u2019ve been given the instruction to drop something off at the house that belongs to a friend of mine who is a bartender in a restaurant. He is a very social person. He\\u2019s very outgoing. He\\u2019s a good dad and has a couple kids. He sells cars and works at the bar a couple shifts a week because he enjoys the people and the contact. He\\u2019s asked me to come to the bar, pick something up, and drop something off at his house. I know where the bar is. I drive that way and meet him there. He gives me a package - it\\u2019s a rectangle, plain, and grey, almost like a cake box from a bakery but more sturdy and heavier. I go back to my car and put it in my car. He tells me the name of his street because in the dream, I\\u2019ve never been to his house. It\\u2019s a really strange flow of vowels and consonants together. He tells me very clearly to go down to the end of the street and turn right at the McDonald\\u2019s. The street runs parallel to the street that McDonald\\u2019s faces. I do this and all that happens is I drive into the parking lot behind the McDonald\\u2019s - it belongs to the McDonald\\u2019s and doesn\\u2019t lead anywhere else. In my confusion, I drive around the area looking for a street with the name, but I can\\u2019t find it. I drive back to the bar. As I\\u2019m parking the car I see another person - Stephanie - she\\u2019s a server but sometimes manages the bar. She has with her a very odd looking dog. She\\u2019s nervous about leaving it alone because she\\u2019s rescued it from somewhere. So she\\u2019s brought it with her to keep it by her side during her shift. She calls it a dog, but it doesn\\u2019t look like a dog. It\\u2019s small like the size of a miniature poodle. It doesn\\u2019t really have poodle hair or even dog hair. It has a thick cotton yarn six-inch long hair or fur or covering. Its face is kind of like a llama. The \\u201cdog\\u201d is in a bag. She takes it out of the bag. I\\u2019m giving her my attention. She\\u2019s excited about this creature. It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s been waiting to adopt it for a long time, but because of its odd habits and strange nervous system, she\\u2019s not supposed to leave it in the house until it adjusts to our climate or world. I say, \\u201cOh wow, I\\u2019m so happy for you.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019ll take it out of the bag and show it to you.\\u201d The dog stands there. Normally dogs will dig in the dirt with their front paws and the dirt flies between their legs and behind them. But its upper body is twisted, so when it digs, its torso and paws bend to a ninety degree angle off to the side. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s really odd.\\u201d She picks the dog back up. I follow her into the bar because I have to talk to my friend about where his house is. I sit there waiting for him not to be busy with customers. She asks me if I\\u2019ll watch the dog in the bag for a moment. I do. I touch the dog and notice the texture of its coat. It\\u2019s like ropes. It\\u2019s very strange. Then I get this energetic flow from the dog. I feel like I\\u2019m suddenly transported to a different perspective. It\\u2019s like all of a sudden I see a quantum field. I see now the driveway and street behind the McDonald\\u2019s was there all along but I missed it because I was looking for something that looked like a street. My friend is still busy with customers and I don\\u2019t talk to him. Stephanie comes back and I give her the dog. I get back in my car and follow the instructions. As I go back behind the McDonald\\u2019s, I see the street. I wonder why I didn\\u2019t notice it before. I turn down the street, find his house, drop off the package, get back in the car and find my way back home.\"],[\"\\u201cPhoto Albums\\u201d This dream doesn\\u2019t have a lot of pattern to it. It\\u2019s mostly scenes, like a photo album. I am at Omar\\u2019s mother\\u2019s house. His mom\\u2019s family is there. His brother is there. His daughter is there. There are other random people. There\\u2019s an idea that we need to go somewhere, but I don\\u2019t really understand what it is. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m sitting in the living room and I feel Omar\\u2019s present. I can see him, but no one else seems to know he\\u2019s there. He tells me to get out my photo album and show it to his daughter. She\\u2019s curious about what he was like as a teenager and a young man. My photo album from my house appears in my hands. I open it up and start to show her different pictures. She\\u2019s much older now than he is in the album. She comments about how young he looks. As I turn the pages, she says, \\u201cOh I didn\\u2019t realize my dad could do that.\\u201d We get into some conversations about things that he did when he was young. That\\u2019s all I remember.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Television Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house of my daughter\\u2019s grandparents, both of whom have crossed over. The house doesn\\u2019t look exactly like the house they used to live in, but I know it\\u2019s their house. I\\u2019m in it and I can feel the air has a different quality - it\\u2019s light and has particles in it, it\\u2019s as though I am standing in front of a window and can see light streaming in with particles floating in it. It\\u2019s so light and bright. The house is empty but it feels like there\\u2019s a presence in the light. Gradually Roberta and Tom appear. They look just like they did when I met them. Tom is busy with a project. He\\u2019s making something outside - he\\u2019s building something. Roberta is inside. She\\u2019s putting something together with her hands. One of her daughters appears and she\\u2019s laughing and joking. She\\u2019s, in a loving way, mocking what her mom is doing. Then they ask me if I would be involved with this project. I ask what it is that they\\u2019re doing. They say they\\u2019re creating hairstyles for people that are going to be on the television show. I realize that there\\u2019s a producer involved that\\u2019s giving some of the instructions, but I can\\u2019t see him and they\\u2019re just making reference to him. Roberta and Tom have a lot of autonomy. Someone is just doing the filming. I agree to do part of the hairstyles. They\\u2019re putting the styles together on paper first, but not as a drawing - it\\u2019s a standout relief like you\\u2019d make a sculpture - only they\\u2019re doing it with bits and pieces of things to create a finished product that is a hairstyle. There are all kinds of stuff woven into the hairstyles as if it\\u2019s been upcycled out of bits of ribbon, yarn and human hair. It\\u2019s colorful and unique in a way that I\\u2019ve never thought of before. It\\u2019s actually coming out more like a headdress which makes sense because they are Native North American. Then Tom comes in from outside and he\\u2019s washing his hands because he\\u2019s been making some kind of vehicle, some kind of car. I don\\u2019t see what he\\u2019s doing, though. He says he\\u2019s about finished and his part is ready to go. We say that we\\u2019re ready to do the headdress. We share a meal and then the producer comes and films Tom\\u2019s part outside first. Someone else is following the prototype headdresses we created and implementing it. We\\u2019re returning the camaraderie, laughing and joking. At one point, Roberta is saying something to me and her daughter is standing right behind me and making remarks like, \\u201cOh sure sure,\\u201d really close to my ear. Roberta says, \\u201cWhat are you saying?\\u201d Her daughter won\\u2019t repeat it. I think that I don\\u2019t like being a vessel for this. Then the producer comes in and asks us if we would like to preview the movie. Everybody says yes. We go to the living room and the lights are dimmed somehow - this is weird because there are no lights in the house, only the heavily particled lightness. But it does dim so we can see a movie projected onto the wall. The opening credits go up showing the background parts that everyone did - creative direction, innovation, etc.. Then, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a screen that comes up with Tom\\u2019s car. I realize the movie is about the making of it. I\\u2019m astonished at the innovation that has been put into this vehicle. It\\u2019s similar to the headdresses we developed. His vehicle is made out of so many different things. It doesn\\u2019t look junky, though, it looks really sophisticated, polished and well integrated. In fact, you wouldn\\u2019t even know it\\u2019s a vehicle when you first look at it. There are so many different things in it. It definitely looks metal, but when you look, you can see pieces that form the finished metal but aren\\u2019t metal. They\\u2019ve got this upcycled feel to it, but in a highly sophisticated and finished product.\"],[\"\\u201cThe ATM\\u201d I\\u2019m in a lineup in the bank. My son is with me. I\\u2019ve got cash and gift cards to deposit. I\\u2019m twelfth in line and when I get to be second in line, I start to organize my piles of cash and gift cards. I realize that I cannot find my bank card, although I know it\\u2019s in my purse. So I\\u2019m disorganized and have too many things in my hands and there is too much stuff in my wallet that is not a bank card. As I\\u2019m trying to juggle all these different piles of things, I now become the first person in line and it\\u2019s my turn. I still can\\u2019t find my bank card. I say to the couple behind me - a man and a woman who appear to know each other and have been chatting happily the whole time - \\u201cI need to set my stuff down on the floor. I can\\u2019t find my bank card. I know it\\u2019s here. Feel free to go ahead.\\u201d They do and I can still hear them chatting happily with each other. I\\u2019ve spread everything out on the floor and sort through them. I\\u2019ve got envelopes opened with bills I\\u2019ve looked at and returned. There are things from my son\\u2019s birthday party. There are gift cards for McDonald\\u2019s that I know we\\u2019ll never use because we don\\u2019t eat there, but we can deposit them into our bank account. I finally locate my bank card. Every time I thought I located my bank card, I would look at it and it was a replica of a bank card but wasn\\u2019t a bank card. It keeps getting into the pile of things to deposit into the ATM by accident because it looks so much like a bank card but it\\u2019s not one. Although when I\\u2019m finally read to make my deposit, the couple that was chatting happily has gone and there are different people who are ready to have their turn. I walk up with my son and say to the person who\\u2019s next: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been looking for my bank card and have already been waiting in this line. Is it okay if I go next?\\u201d They\\u2019re quite happy to let me go. I get there and the screen is like an electronic game board - like \\u201cSnakes and Ladders\\u201d or \\u201cGame of Life\\u201d or \\u201cMouse Trap\\u201d or one of those really colorful game boards for kids with lights and red, green and yellow. I try to put my bank card in and realize it\\u2019s this dummy bank card again. I pull it out and am trying to sift through. I have different deposits in between each finger and thumb as if my hand is a categorized sorter. I know I\\u2019m taking a really long time. The bank machine spits out the pseudo bank card. I ask my son if he\\u2019ll hold a couple things. I\\u2019m still trying to get the bank card. I turn around and explain to the person behind me: \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. The machine keeps rejecting my card.\\u201d Then, I locate the real bank card and put it in. Now it\\u2019s asking me to select from one of the buttons underneath if I want to deposit gift cards. The button is really tiny. There are three buttons you can press and they\\u2019re all really close together. I keep trying to push the one button. Finally it works. Every time you push a button, a whole bunch of other things light up on this screen. There are pictures of circus people and they aren\\u2019t just pictures, they\\u2019re animated parts that are moving. I get the gift card thing to work and insert them one at a time. On the screen, which is quite large - probably 12x12 - it\\u2019s like a record of your deposits and says exactly what you deposited and how much the gift card was worth. So I\\u2019m feeding four gift cards in. Then it tells me what bills I need to pay. I had the bills all organized. You have to push each bill into the machine to pay your bills. I think I\\u2019m almost done when the bank teller comes out with three big boxes of past records of bill payments. I\\u2019m unprepared to deal with all of this. I finish my transaction and allow the ATM to return my card so someone else can have their turn. I thank the person behind me for waiting patiently. Then I look at what's in these boxes. It is my whole life, everywhere I\\u2019ve lived, as if the bank has kept records of this and it\\u2019s all in the boxes and sorted sequentially in years and months in a proper sorting job. All of these envelopes have been opened with transaction receipts that are on letterhead folded in threes and put back in the envelope and sorted chronologically. It goes all the way back through every relationship I\\u2019ve ever had prior to my daughter\\u2019s birth with all the different houses I\\u2019ve lived in, everywhere I\\u2019ve traveled. I think that I\\u2019ve taken care of this. I\\u2019ve paid my taxes. I didn\\u2019t even know there were records that this stuff existed. I decide to just shred them and not even attempt to go through all these boxes and take everything out to look at it. I\\u2019m done with that. I\\u2019m good. I pick the boxes up. I walk around the giant line of people waiting for the ATM. I notice the material of the floors and walls. I notice the architecture of the building. Everything is made of marble. Feet click on the marble. It\\u2019s very ostentatious, yet it is quite simple. I guess it\\u2019s like an expensive institution style architecture without a lot of external trappings; it\\u2019s all straight and linear, boxed. The ceiling, however, is really high. I\\u2019m standing at the teller waiting to say that these things need to be shredded. I see the woman who was part of the couple chatting happily. She\\u2019s telling one of the tellers that now there is a hot studio on the top floor of this building. She\\u2019s pretty happy about this and she\\u2019s going to go up there and try it. I think to myself, \\u201cWow, that seems odd that there would be a hot yoga studio on the twelfth floor of a bank institution.\\u201d I watch her go upstairs. She\\u2019s dressed really colorfully. She\\u2019s wearing a tan mini skirt and bright pink jacket that almost meets the hem of the mini skirt. I watch her walk up the stairs. The teller takes my boxes. I say, \\u201cPlease just shred these.\\u201d Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cHigh School, Again\\u201d The dream starts off and I\\u2019m in something that looks like a school. It\\u2019s quite a big building with a couple floors and has the feel of a high school. There are lockers lining the hallways. It\\u2019s the expanded version of high school but doesn\\u2019t look like the one I went to - it just represents high school. In one of the rooms, there are four large round tables, but they\\u2019re really low to the floor like you\\u2019d see in a daycare. There are chairs around the tables. There\\u2019s a bathtub with a shower curtain pulled across it on one side. Across the hall from this room - and the hall is lined with lockers - is a doorway that leads into my apartment. All I see of my apartment is just the one room you enter. So as you open the door, it goes into a living area. There is some living room furniture like a couch and a couple other chairs for single people, some end tables and lamps. There\\u2019s a closet with a cheap sliding door where coats are hung. It does look like there\\u2019s a kitchen off to the right although I do not enter it in my dream. In my dream I leave my apartment, walk across the hall and see that people are starting to gather around the tables. I see a couple friends from high school. I\\u2019m still friends with one of them even though she\\u2019s moved quite a distance away. It doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s been a long time because we do message on Facebook. She stands up and I give her a hug. Then we both sit down at the table. I\\u2019m having trouble fitting my adult size body under the table - my knees don\\u2019t fit under because the table and chairs are so low. I kind of sit sideways to the table and rest my elbows on the top. Then I see another person that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. She moved right out of high school and she and her husband live out west. I\\u2019m really happy to see her and give her a big hug. She says, \\u201cOh my goodness, that was a really strong hug.\\u201d She\\u2019s laughing and I\\u2019m laughing, too. I tell her that I\\u2019ve been working out and my arms are strong. There\\u2019s some kind of job that I\\u2019m to start in February that requires upper body strength. I say, \\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t always been like this, but I really wanted the job. So in November I started lifting weights with my arms. Good thing it\\u2019s only December! If this were February, I might have squeezed you harder!\\u201d She laughs. We sit down at the table. Again, it\\u2019s hard for me to get my legs under, so I sit sideways with my elbows on the table. Other people join us. We\\u2019ve taken out our lunch and are eating a little and chatting with light-hearted humor. I notice behind me that there\\u2019s a different group of people starting to assemble at the other round table. I notice Lisa - the friend who betrayed our friendship. She also betrayed her own brother\\u2019s wife. It\\u2019s the brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends that are starting to gather at the table behind me. I\\u2019m aware of this out of my peripheral vision. Then I need to go into the washroom, so I excuse myself and get up from the table. I go to the bathtub with shower curtain. I\\u2019m not having a shower. I don\\u2019t remember using the toilet or sink. I just go in and pull the shower curtain across. I\\u2019m in there for a few minutes then come out again. Now I see that Lisa is sitting at the table with her brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends. They all have stony looks on their faces. She has her arms folded over her chest. I think, \\u201cUgh, why is she even sitting there? I wonder what\\u2019s going on with that. They look so awkward and agitated.\\u201d But I\\u2019m glad she didn\\u2019t sit down with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I\\u2019m hoping as I walk back to my table that she won\\u2019t look at me. She doesn\\u2019t, which is good, and I sit back down with my friends. Then, we\\u2019re finishing our lunch and it\\u2019s time to go somewhere else. Everyone else in the room has cleared, including Lisa. There\\u2019s only one person left at the table where I was sitting and I\\u2019m wanting to clean it up. There are rolls of paper towels which actually look like toilet paper rolls. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s a good idea to cut paper towel rolls in half because people only normally need a little bit anyway.\\u201d I remove a couple pieces and wipe up the table. Then I take the rest of the paper towel which is now opened. I set it in front of my apartment door. I\\u2019m tidying up and putting everything away. At this point, a few people start coming back into the room. It\\u2019s all clean and lunch has been put away. Somebody says, \\u201cWhere are all the paper towels?\\u201d As I\\u2019m about to indicate that I\\u2019ve put everything away, there\\u2019s a rumor flying around the room. The rumor is an embodiment of itself where it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s more than one voice talking at once. I can hear phrases like, \\u201cWho would take all the paper towels? Why are there no paper towels? Has anyone reported this?\\u201d I think, \\u201cWh? Was there supposed to be a lot of paper towels in here?\\u201d I\\u2019m about to indicate that there were no other paper towels in here and I have a roll right there, but all these rumors with false information got together and now there were supposed to have been three boxes of paper towels lined up against the wall and they\\u2019re all missing. The janitor is going to be upset. I say to someone, \\u201cWell why doesn\\u2019t someone ask the janitor if there\\u2019s supposed to be three boxes here? Ask where they\\u2019re supposed to be kept. There\\u2019s no point getting all upset about this.\\u201d Then I point with my finger and say, \\u201cLook! There\\u2019s a partial half roll right there. Let\\u2019s use that for what we need and then go and retrace the steps of where these have all gone.\\u201d Nobody is listening. Then I see Lisa look at it. She\\u2019s adding to the rumor that I\\u2019ve stolen all the paper towels. I\\u2019m trying to explain to people that I just cleaned up and wiped up all the tables. I put the half roll in front of the door because I didn't know where it went and didn\\u2019t want to leave it on the center of the table. No one is really focused on any one certain thing and no one is asking the janitor where they\\u2019re supposed to be or if in fact any are missing at all. Maybe he hasn\\u2019t brought them up for the day.\"],[\"\\u201cGrapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water\\u201d This dream starts in my house. It\\u2019s not the house I currently live in; it\\u2019s not a house I\\u2019m familiar with at all. I\\u2019m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we\\u2019ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It\\u2019s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It\\u2019s beautiful. It\\u2019s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don\\u2019t say anything. We\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cYep, this is going to be good.\\u201d We go in. There\\u2019s an older woman who is taking people\\u2019s names. She\\u2019s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it\\u2019s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person\\u2019s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it\\u2019s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people\\u2019s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We\\u2019re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she\\u2019s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it\\u2019s like a black walnut dark. It\\u2019s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people\\u2019s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It\\u2019s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re standing on. I realize what they\\u2019re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life - they\\u2019re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it\\u2019s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I\\u2019m on a rollercoaster, but it\\u2019s moving through the church. I can see the track that it\\u2019s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there\\u2019s no track after that and we\\u2019re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don\\u2019t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It\\u2019s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That\\u2019s where everybody is going. So we\\u2019re new and we follow the crowd. It\\u2019s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I\\u2019ll slide backwards, but I don\\u2019t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there\\u2019s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there\\u2019s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It\\u2019s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I\\u2019m sitting in, I realize it\\u2019s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it\\u2019s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We\\u2019re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it\\u2019s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I\\u2019m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I\\u2019ve noticed that we\\u2019re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We\\u2019ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it\\u2019s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we\\u2019re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn\\u2019t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: \\u201cHave we contributed to this in some way?\\u201d So there\\u2019s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we\\u2019re just supposed to help make it or if we\\u2019ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there\\u2019s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I\\u2019m asking her if she knows where we\\u2019re supposed to be at what time. She says, \\u201cOh yes, I still have that information, it\\u2019s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven\\u2019t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you\\u2019d be back.\\u201d That\\u2019s just a memory. Then the people we\\u2019re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We\\u2019ve walked down this path from the church - it\\u2019s a dirt path that\\u2019s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren\\u2019t in an urban area. It\\u2019s like non-urbanized, but we\\u2019re not in the woods because there\\u2019s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can\\u2019t see what they are. It\\u2019s not just a dock, it\\u2019s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we\\u2019ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I\\u2019ve recently noted that he\\u2019s involved in this conspiracy group and they\\u2019re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He\\u2019s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it\\u2019s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we\\u2019re with take the cloth off the boat. I\\u2019m happy to see it\\u2019s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: \\u201cYou know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI do, but it\\u2019s not mine. Whose boat is it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn\\u2019t here and this other person who I don\\u2019t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it\\u2019s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I\\u2019m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I\\u2019m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it\\u2019s okay. He says, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It\\u2019s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I\\u2019ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I\\u2019m checking out the rigging.There\\u2019s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They\\u2019re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it\\u2019s a weird place to have this because normally they\\u2019re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can\\u2019t see what the operate. I\\u2019m trying to figure this out. The ship\\u2019s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I\\u2019m looking at it I\\u2019m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I\\u2019m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they\\u2019re not even ships at all, but they\\u2019re bobbing up and down so they\\u2019re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I\\u2019m off the boat of the woman who I didn\\u2019t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that\\u2019s okay because I didn\\u2019t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don\\u2019t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he\\u2019s not there. So I text him and ask him if he\\u2019s going to be sailing today. He says, \\u201cYes. Just wait there and I\\u2019ll be down at my boat in a moment.\\u201d My daughter and I wait. We\\u2019re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We\\u2019re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, \\u201cOkay, are you guys ready to go?\\u201d We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it\\u2019s right up against the dock and as we look in, it\\u2019s so deep that it\\u2019s black - you can\\u2019t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it\\u2019s so long I can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s enormous. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Radio Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really interesting old house here. It\\u2019s semi-dark, too - it\\u2019s like the air has that kind of presence to it where the molecules have some kind of sentience. You can feel the energy in the air. It feels compassionate. So it\\u2019s also not very light. The windows, although they\\u2019re big, don\\u2019t seem to transmit an awful lot of light, so that casts a little bit of a shadowy effect over everything in the house. I\\u2019m aware that there is a floor above me, but I don't go into it in my dream. The ceilings are really high. The windows are deep and wide. It feels like mid-eighteenth century architecture of someone who would have had enough money to build a fair-sized house. I guess you would call the parlor, because it\\u2019s off the kitchen, has a big archway that goes into the sitting room. I can see the sitting room and kitchen from the parlor, but I stay in the parlor which has a big couch with deep cushions in it and a turkish rug that\\u2019s woven and quite colorful in muted tones. There\\u2019s electronic equipment against one of the walls. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m supposed to be recording some kind of radio show. In order to add my segment, I have to walk over to the electronic equipment - it\\u2019s got dials on it - and I\\u2019m moving the dials around watching the needle on the screen move up and down as I turn the dial. I\\u2019m trying to get it centered in the screen so I have a signal. Once I get the needle centered, I can hear the radio show that\\u2019s in progress. When I hear a certain tone, I\\u2019m supposed to start talking. I have brought with me what looks like an iPod, but it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s some kind of device that adds music that will be a bridge. I have to fade in the music, let it play for a few seconds, then fade the music out, then I\\u2019m to say what I\\u2019m supposed to say. My segment is 30 minutes. So I do this. I am waiting for the tone and I hear the tone. Somebody else\\u2019s music enters the feed. I can hear it, but when I try to center the dials to add my section, that music won\\u2019t go away. I think, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just sit here and wait the half hour that my segment is supposed to be and if the music keeps playing, then I\\u2019ll just leave after the half hour is over. I\\u2019m waiting. Twenty-three minutes pass and I know there\\u2019s only seven minutes left. I think it\\u2019s almost going to be time for me to go when someone else comes in the room. She says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re not adding your part.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s this strange music that isn\\u2019t responding to any of the dials.\\u201d So she goes over and starts moving the dials around. She\\u2019s trying to fix it. Her girlfriend comes into the room and sits down on the floor and waits. She spends the next seven minutes fiddling with it. Then the time is up. I just tell them I\\u2019m going to go. They ask, \\u201cCan you come back and try again tomorrow at the same time?\\u201d I consider this for a minute wondering if i want to keep just coming back here and waiting for nothing to happen. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try and come back one more time tomorrow.\\u201d Then, I\\u2019ve got this pack that goes across one shoulder, across my body and sits on my hip. I reach into it and grab two round discs about the size of a Canadian toonie. But they\\u2019re not toonies. They\\u2019re bumpy, thin and made of a condensed grain of some sort. I\\u2019m thinking that if you put them in water, they\\u2019ll swell up. I hand one of them to her. I close up the flat. As I turn around I notice one of my students is there. He walks with me as I go out the door. I walk down the porch and all of a sudden, it\\u2019s a lot lighter outside, but the sun isn\\u2019t shining; it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s less darkness. Het disappears - I guess he walks somewhere else. There\\u2019s a group of people, vendors, that have lined up these tall skinny tables that are like tubs along the sidewalk. I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s in them - they\\u2019re a little taller than my head, so I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s inside. They\\u2019re probably 1 foot by 2 foot in diameter and maybe another 1 foot deep. At the end of one, there\\u2019s a stepladder and I can climb up to see what\\u2019s in there. As I climb up, I see a whole bunch more of these little discs. I realize that they\\u2019re not made of grain, but of almonds. A woman who appears to be in charge approaches. She says \\u201cAa-mond\\u201d instead of almond. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cIs that the proper way to say this?\\u201d She repeats it twice like a callout: \\u201cAa-mond Aa-mond, Aa-mond Aamond.\\u201d So she\\u2019s selling them. She asks me if I\\u2019m interested in one of the Aa-monds Aa-monds. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you.\\u201d She says, \\u201cCome and sit down with me. I want to talk with you.\\u201d There\\u2019s something that looks like a two-person porch swing where the people are facing each other and your feet sit on the bottom and it moves on its own rocker. She sits in it and indicates that she wants me to sit across from her. So I do. She leans in. She has a smirk on her face as though she thinks it\\u2019s funny and says, \\u201cWhat do you think of Aa-mond Aa-mond?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe catchy way you\\u2019re pronouncing it? Or the product itself?\\u201d She says, No, what do you think of the way I\\u2019m calling it out?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s catchy. Caught my eye. I don\\u2019t understand what it is, but it was catchy enough that I turned my head to listen to you.\\u201d She kind of laughs. Right at that point, the dream ends, but in front of my face, I see this dangling pendant. It\\u2019s the size of my face and is all silver. It looks like it\\u2019s made out of molded Mercury. It\\u2019s a cat - a wild cat. It\\u2019s strangely futuristic amid this old-style market. It\\u2019s sleek, like a jaguar. It\\u2019s dangling on something. So it just appears and hangs down in front of my face. It\\u2019s probably 8-10 inches long and maybe about 4 inches wide. The mouth is slightly open and the lips are sort of curled back and it has fangs. It really looks like a jaguar head, except its ears are flattened, so there\\u2019s a sleakness about it that really doesn\\u2019t belong in the historical feel of the house, street market or the Aa-mond Aamond that people are selling.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Mural\\u201d It\\u2019s strange that I\\u2019m in the bedroom I had when I was a kid, but the furniture is gone. There are several people here with me, including my daughter and somebody I used to work with - I can\\u2019t remember which restaurant and I\\u2019m not even sure of his name. I think there is the man who did my daughter\\u2019s tattoo. I feel like my stepmother is in there, as well. The point of everybody being there is to draw a mural. It\\u2019s not clear what the subject of the mural is supposed to look like. One person starts off drawing in black with paint and a paintbrush what looks to be a fish. But then somebody comments, \\u201cNo that\\u2019s not right. That\\u2019s not what it looks like,\\u201d and then adjusts it - makes the torso/belly area a little thinner and makes it even thinner as it goes back towards the tail. Then someone else says, \\u201cMmm, that\\u2019s closer, but it still doesn\\u2019t look right.\\u201d Then someone else takes the paintbrush and begins to draw legs on it. Now it\\u2019s starting to look more like an insect with somewhat of a fish face. There\\u2019s a consensus that yes, that\\u2019s much closer to what it resembled. Then my daughter gets in there and removes part of it and adds what I think is much more accurate in terms of the legs and ribcage. Then I fall asleep for a little while, maybe just five minutes. I don\\u2019t think anyone noticed I was sleeping. When I woke up, it\\u2019s stunning. I\\u2019m thinking that it\\u2019s exactly what it looks like and it\\u2019s even got more details. I see the tattoo artist with the paintbrush in his hand and think yes, he would have been the one to put the detail on it. Then the other guy leaves the room and I do, too. We go down the hall and into the kitchen. He stays in the kitchen and I go out front of the kitchen. Now it looks like the kitchen has a passthrough window and the seating area is a big wide square auditorium. There are long rectangular tables set up that hold food, like a wedding buffet. The tables are covered with a white cloth. There are also round tables covered with white cloths and they have multiple chairs at them. There\\u2019s a stage like a school auditorium, but there\\u2019s no one on it and people aren\\u2019t facing the stage, either. The food is all set out on this one L-shaped table. I look at it and think that the food looks disgusting. It looks sloppy. Every single one has dried ramen noodles on the top as some kind of garnish. The items in the bowls are covered with breading. Each one looks slightly the same, only a little different. There are also cheese balls rolled in cracker crumbs and deep fried. I just think, \\u201cUgh, there\\u2019s nothing fresh anywhere.\\u201d My son is sitting at the table and I know he needs to eat. So I take two plates - one for him and one for me - and I head for the platter of plain roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. I think we can eat that. Just as I get there, a man who looks like the man who bought my sailboat. In my dream he has three little kids. He takes the big serving fork and squishes all the chicken up with the mashed potatoes and gravy and it\\u2019s making some kind of thick soup. I\\u2019m aghast because there were dried wheat noodles on the top and now they\\u2019re all mixed in. I say to him, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that on a buffet! Now nobody else can eat that.\\u201d He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWell, my kids like it that way.\\u201d I tell him that now there\\u2019s nothing for us to eat. I\\u2019m angry. I can feel the anger in my body - I can feel my heart racing and my body tightening up. So I try to sift through it with my spoon to determine if there are any pieces of potato or chicken that the gravy and wheat didn\\u2019t stick to. But after putting two tiny spoonfuls on my plate, I know it\\u2019s hopeless and I just set the plates down. My son goes back to the table and he\\u2019s just sitting there. I approach the kitchen and am thinking, \\u201cI wonder if that Rob guy has anything back there that he could give us that is not quite ready to be served on the table and hasn\\u2019t been coated with all that yucky stuff yet.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and notice that at the base of the passthrough window has holes with stagnant water in them. The water is black with algae. I can smell the mildew earth smell rising up from it. I wonder if the water was removed from it, if it would dry up and be more healthy. There\\u2019s a plastic pump with a long hose and a hand pump at the other end. It\\u2019s like the pump you\\u2019d use to pump out the bilge in a sailboat. So I stick the end in the water and I start pumping. The water does go out of the hole, but as soon as it goes out, it fills up again. I repeat this process about three times. It keeps filling up, but it only fills up a little bit, just enough to cover the black earth that is the component part of the hole. So I set the pump down and I stop. I\\u2019m hesitant to ask for food from the kitchen. I go back to the table and tell my son, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go.\\u201d We walk down a different hallway than we entered the room from. There are multiple bedrooms like there would be in a hotel for people to sleep in.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Operation\\u201d In this dream I\\u2019m at my sister and brother-in-law\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m sitting on a stool in their kitchen with my elbows on the kitchen island. My nephew who is training to be in Medical school - in fact he\\u2019s almost finished - has got a colander out of the cupboard and put three or four potatoes in it. He leaves it on the island and then leaves the kitchen. I think to myself: \\u201cHmm, I guess I\\u2019m supposed to be making the mashed potatoes.\\u201d Instead of cooking them and mashing them with a potato masher, I poke them repeatedly with some sort of instrument that I have in my hand - it\\u2019s some kind of kitchen tool. I do this until they are little tiny pieces of potato in the colander. Two other members of my family (it\\u2019s fuzzy who they are) come in. They are criticizing the way I\\u2019ve done this and saying it won\\u2019t work. My nephew returns to the kitchen and says, \\u201cOh yes, this will work. This is how I learned to do it at school. I\\u2019ve done this before. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Because he said that, the people who were criticizing me stop criticizing. Then the potatoes are cooked and they\\u2019ve turned out just fine.\"],[\"\\u201cFootball Team\\u201d I'm walking through a pine forest. It\\u2019s fairly dense. I\\u2019m moving my arms up over my head in places so I can get my body through. It starts to get a little more sparse, then comes out into a clearing. There\\u2019s snow everywhere. I see up ahead of me a frost fencing and something that looks like it could be a building, although it\\u2019s mostly masked in snow. I walk through the snow towards the frost fencing. A man is standing there and he\\u2019s giving directions of some sort. He indicates that I am supposed to go straight ahead. As I\\u2019m walking through, other people start to gather. It\\u2019s getting a little more crowded. Then I remember I\\u2019m standing in a circle with people. I have something in my hand but i can\\u2019t see what it is. Other people are standing around and I know one of them - Blake. He gives me a bear hug and says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really good to see you.\\u201d As he lifts me up, my feet are off the ground. I can feel my body stretching - it feels like a full body stretch. When he sets me down, I wish he would do it again because the stretching felt really good. We\\u2019re being told to continue on our way towards the building. I notice the guys are wearing football uniforms - jerseys and pants. I wonder if I\\u2019m there for a game.\"],[\"\\u201cOpen Air Concert\\u201d I\\u2019m standing in a crowd in a large fairground area. There is hard packed earth and grass underneath my feet. It\\u2019s dark - it\\u2019s night time. The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn\\u2019t say anything but I know it\\u2019s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There\\u2019s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he\\u2019s somewhat hard although I don\\u2019t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There\\u2019s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren\\u2019t sitting down though, they\\u2019re just standing up. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don\\u2019t want to sit with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I\\u2019m looking for Trent because he\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen and know. I don\\u2019t find him.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Daughter\\u2019s Fish Tanks\\u201d My daughter is away and my son and I are taking care of her pets. It\\u2019s a two-story house and I\\u2019m really uncertain whether or not we all live together in the safe house or if my son and I are staying in my daughter\\u2019s house for the purpose of taking care of her pets. We\\u2019re on the main floor of the house when the dream starts. We are looking after her cats and some other strange mix of mammal - I\\u2019m not really sure what it is. It has skin that is slightly furry but not a lot of fur, maybe like a horse. It\\u2019s small, a little smaller than a cat. It has a long neck and very appealing eyes. We\\u2019re going about our daily activities. I\\u2019m mucking about in the garden and Daniel is doing his own thing. We feed the mammal-like creatures in the morning and then again at suppertime. We do this for a whole 24-hour day. When I go down to the basement to get something, I see two other tanks there. One of them is a water tank and it\\u2019s filled with water creatures. The other one has reptiles in it. I\\u2019m horrified because the one with the reptiles is a really large, large, large cage and the reptiles are at the bottom but there\\u2019s a tiny very angry chimpanzee about the size of my hand rattling the sides of the cage and screaming because it\\u2019s so hungry. I yell up to my son, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you tell me she\\u2019s got two more down here?!\\u201d He says he\\u2019s sorry and he forgot. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god the snakes are all upset!\\u201d And there\\u2019s a cobra, a black cobra with gold markings on its skin and it\\u2019s half-sitting up with its hood fanned out. All the animals are agitated. The water tank with the fish like ones have their teeth bared and I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to eat each other. I\\u2019m just really horrified and upset that the animals are suffering because we did not feed them. I tell my son to go get the food for the reptiles and the tiny chimpanzee. I\\u2019m looking around for the food for the water tank. So I put the food in the tank and am watching the fish eat it. I notice the water level has dropped down at least a food. I think I\\u2019d better put more water in it. I get a pitcher and fill it with warm water. I\\u2019m checking the temperature with my fingers to make sure it\\u2019s body temperature. I add two pitchers in and now the water is about six inches from the top and I think that\\u2019s good. Then I go to check on the other tank and they seem okay. I\\u2019m just watching their behavior for a few minutes. Then I turn around and the fish tank is full to the top with water! How did this happen? It can\\u2019t be this full because the fish and other creatures will swim overtop of it and out onto the floor and they\\u2019ll die. So I take up the pitcher and I\\u2019m slowly trying to submerge the pitcher a little bit so that only the water goes into the pitcher without also pulling some of the creatures or living plants with it. But one is in there! I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s an aquatic animal or plant. So I try to keep the water in the pitcher and just pour out the creature. I manage to do this and then I pour the excess water into the laundry tub. I go back to the fish tank. My son has poured some hot water in and again I\\u2019m really upset. I feel it with my finger and take some of the water out then add some cold water in and it feels normal again. I\\u2019m looking at them to see if they\\u2019re all still living. I\\u2019m just in such a state of agitation because I know this is terrible for them. As I\\u2019m dumping out one more jug of just water to equalize the temperature, I look and all the water is gone! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, how could you do this?! Go get a jug!\\u201d I\\u2019m putting body temperature water into my son\\u2019s jug and tell him to quickly go put it in the tank. I ask him how long it\\u2019s been like this. Then I take another jug in. I\\u2019m wondering if that\\u2019s enough to keep them breathing until we manage to fill the rest of the tank up. We are frantically doing this. I notice the tank with the reptiles and the small chimpanzee is getting even more and more agitated. I wonder what else is going on where they are or if they\\u2019re agitated because the creatures in the water tank might be dying. I\\u2019m wondering if I should let them all go and maybe they\\u2019ll live. The feeling is quickly mixed in with the fact that my daughter trusted us and I need to soothe this so that they\\u2019re alive when she gets here and allow her to make that decision. I\\u2019m also looking at the expression on the small chimpanzee\\u2019s face. This small chimpanzee is capable of communicating to me what is really happening in the animal world in both tanks.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Shopping Mall\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large urban city. It\\u2019s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can\\u2019t identify where I am because of it. I\\u2019m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I\\u2019ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It\\u2019s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I\\u2019m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says \\u201cyou are here\\u201d and lists the index of all the stores, but I don\\u2019t see one. Because I\\u2019m still looking, I\\u2019m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren\\u2019t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they\\u2019re offering. They\\u2019re all specialty shops. Each store that\\u2019s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they\\u2019re not made of raincoat material or anything; they\\u2019re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they\\u2019ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there\\u2019s very little inventory offered in each. I think, \\u201cWow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.\\u201d Then I figure that whatever it is that they\\u2019re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what\\u2019s in the windows and note in a general way, \\u201cOh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I\\u2019m not even going to look at it.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cAdventures\\u201d I take a taxi to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I arrive and he\\u2019s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I\\u2019m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I\\u2019m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He\\u2019s also wearing something similar. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t really look like pajamas, so it\\u2019s okay to go out in them.\\u201d So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He\\u2019s in the front seat, passenger side. I\\u2019m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I\\u2019ve ever been to the town stadium. I\\u2019m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, \\u201cDo you mean the Place or the Colosseum?\\u201d At the same time as he\\u2019s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He\\u2019s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I\\u2019m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we\\u2019re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It\\u2019s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it\\u2019s glassed in and there\\u2019s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it\\u2019s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there\\u2019s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I\\u2019ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He\\u2019s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I\\u2019m trying to think where I\\u2019ve seen him. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He\\u2019s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they\\u2019re hundreds of years old. They look like they\\u2019re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it\\u2019s old because the lawns aren\\u2019t maincured, but set because they\\u2019ve been cared for so long they don\\u2019t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it\\u2019s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800\\u2019s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you\\u2019re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It\\u2019s just a screen door and is not latched. I can\\u2019t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman\\u2019s voice say, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I answer back, \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It\\u2019s a kitchen. It\\u2019s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it\\u2019s made just for cooking. There\\u2019s a doorway and we go into the next room. There\\u2019s a proper sized eating table in it. There\\u2019s another oven on the wall and I don\\u2019t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it\\u2019s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn\\u2019t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you\\u2019re on the waterfront. We\\u2019re about to go down the steps when I say, \\u201cJust a minute. Let\\u2019s walk back through here again. I noticed something.\\u201d So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, \\u201cLook, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There\\u2019s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn\\u2019t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.\\u201d Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We\\u2019re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I\\u2019m walking. He doesn\\u2019t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It\\u2019s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I\\u2019m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He\\u2019s a little more scared than I. I\\u2019m surprised that he\\u2019s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it\\u2019s like a pig fetus. It\\u2019s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He\\u2019s getting a little scared. It\\u2019s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I\\u2019m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can\\u2019t see it if you\\u2019re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There\\u2019s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there\\u2019s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They\\u2019re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there\\u2019s this other kind of thing that I see. It\\u2019s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to swim in that water.\\u201d Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She\\u2019s clothed and under the water. It looks like she\\u2019s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, \\u201cOh no! We have to save her!\\u201d So, I slip into the water and grab her. She\\u2019s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady\\u2019s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There\\u2019s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she\\u2019s only been hanging onto the pole and she\\u2019s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she\\u2019s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She\\u2019s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, \\u201cLook, she\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I\\u2019m giving her small sips and supporting her head.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Hanson Family Home\\u201d I am at a picnic table outside near the side of a road. There are two picnic tables. Although we can\\u2019t see the cars driving by from this area, I know we\\u2019re right beside a highway. There\\u2019s a gravel shoulder at the edge of a big road on one side of us. There\\u2019s a rough grassy area that\\u2019s speckled with dirt and gravel; there\\u2019s not very much growing there, just a little bit of grass. These two picnic tables are angled in an L-shape. There's a really rough structure, like what you\\u2019d find at a really old gas station store, but there are no gas pumps. So I\\u2019m sitting there and we\\u2019ve got some kind of meal. We\\u2019re evaluating whether or not this thing you sit in can be seen or noticed. One looks like a bathtub and the sides are copper, but it\\u2019s copper coating over enamel and the copper is being used to disguise it; the edges are probably about fourteen inches. There\\u2019s another one where the edges do not come up so high and they are only about six inches tall, but there\\u2019s a lip around the outside. It\\u2019s also been copper coated. We\\u2019re sitting in them on top of the picnic table bench. The other people at the table (not in the tubs) are saying whether or not this is noticeable. We think the shorter one will be less noticable. As it turns out, when we get a good look at them and people are sitting in them, the one that goes up fourteen inches kind of hugs your rib cage and sits under your armpits and because of the copper color, blends in with what people are wearing. You can\\u2019t really notice anyone is sitting in it as they\\u2019re eating. Whereas the other one has that big lip that sticks out and it\\u2019s a vast color difference between the tub and the people\\u2019s bodies and the shape of it is unnatural. So, we\\u2019re reporting back that the shorter one is not a good disguise. Then the scene changes and we\\u2019re in the Hanson\\u2019s house, only there is hardly any furniture in it and in some rooms, there\\u2019s none. The parents are there. The mom especially is more visible than the dad but I know he\\u2019s there somewhere. We walk in the door and the mom is sitting on a ladder facing away from it. She\\u2019s reading something. We go through that room which is empty of furniture. We go into a sitting room with a couch along one wall and where the tv would have been, there is nothing. No one is sitting there. Then we walk into what would have been the dining room. Again, there\\u2019s nothing in it. We go into the kitchen, which is now just an island attached to the wall with cupboards overtop. We walk in between the island and the wall to where the kitchen sink and counter occupy the whole end of the wall. I\\u2019m with Carrie, the youngest member of the family. Her older sister was my best friend in high school and in real life she\\u2019s gone - she died of cancer - but in my dream she\\u2019s still there as a ghost. Carrie and I are trying to wash a mountain of dishes that their four brothers and friends created. It\\u2019s horrible! I pick up one bag off the floor; it\\u2019s a shopping bag that was full of egg salad and some of the egg salad spills out onto the floor. I\\u2019m trying to scoop it up back into the abg. There\\u2019s all this gooped on food and you can\\u2019t even wash the dishes until you sort out dirty dishes from garbage, so we\\u2019re doing that. As we\\u2019re doing that, we\\u2019re hearing a conversation coming from the room with the couch. We\\u2019re both listening and trying to figure out what the two guys are saying. One is one of her middle brothers. He sounds different though. The other is a stranger and we don\\u2019t know who he is. The stranger sounds like he\\u2019s trying to sell something to her brother. We just don\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s trying to sell and it doesn\\u2019t make any sense. Her brother is kind of interested but not responding entirely favorably to the sales pitch. Then there\\u2019s silence - they both fall silent. I said to her: \\u201cDon\\u2019t your parents live in a different house now? Did they keep this house you grew up in? Are just you kids living in it? Are you all splitting the mortgage or rent?\\u201d Then, we turn around and the stranger is coming in through what would have been the eating kitchen. He stands there and addresses us; he\\u2019s trying to give us the same pitch. I\\u2019m highly suspicious of him. He looks and sounds slimy like a salesman trying to sell something that isn\\u2019t authentic. He looks wormy - his body shape is kind of wormy; he\\u2019s really pale and slender and he\\u2019s got tight cropped mousy brown hair and a nondescript face. I automatically don\\u2019t like him. Carrie and I look at each other with a slitty eyed look, like, \\u201cRight this guy\\u2019s gotta go!\\u201d She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll handle this.\\u201d She turns around and says, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d I continue cleaning up the dishes and am making some headway now - I scrape the garbage into one bag and am washing. When I\\u2019m finished, I go into the room where they are. The guy that I thought was her brother was actually a student from my advanced yoga teacher training, only he\\u2019s gained 200 pounds. He\\u2019s wearing an old man\\u2019s housecoat that you put on over your head. You can sort of see the rolls of fat of his body through the mesh of the robe and it has the big cotton pockets on the front. He and Carrie have obviously had some kind of conversation and the stranger is gone. We go back through the room where her mom was sitting on the ladder, but her mom is gone. Now we\\u2019re climbing up the stairs to go to the upper floor with just three bedrooms. Two of the boys share one, the other two share another and Carrie and her sister share the third. But Ellie\\u2019s bed is empty and Carrie is in the room by herself. She answers the question I asked her earlier and says, \\u201cNo, we don\\u2019t have an extra house. This is still our family home.\\u201d I\\u2019m surprised and feel confused because in the pictures, there is furniture in the house and this one doesn\\u2019t look like either home. I look over at Ellie\\u2019s empty bed and it is still the way she left it the last time she slept there. It has the green plaid bedspread and some of the ways she would have creatively decorated their tiny room. There\\u2019s something of mine in the room, too, because I stayed overnight there. I decide to pack my things up and it\\u2019s time to go.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arrangement\\u201d The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor\\u2019s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It\\u2019s some kind of reception, but I\\u2019m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don\\u2019t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he\\u2019s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he\\u2019s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I\\u2019ve earned it. I see in my mind\\u2019s eyes the word, \\u201cPlacement\\u201d on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I\\u2019m talking to them and realize I\\u2019m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It\\u2019s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There\\u2019s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It\\u2019s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It\\u2019s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he\\u2019s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I\\u2019m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I\\u2019m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I\\u2019m moving from one group to another making sure they\\u2019re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I\\u2019m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I\\u2019m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I\\u2019m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It\\u2019s hard for me to do this. I\\u2019m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It\\u2019s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There\\u2019s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I\\u2019m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don\\u2019t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll just sit with you.\\u201d This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There\\u2019s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It\\u2019s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it\\u2019s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I\\u2019m just now understanding this. So I\\u2019m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven\\u2019t had any time to get to know each other. I don\\u2019t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They\\u2019re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what\\u2019s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don\\u2019t. But my arranged husband does. There\\u2019s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we\\u2019re all in my arranged husband\\u2019s car and driving up towards his house. It\\u2019s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I\\u2019m responsible for making food. I\\u2019ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They\\u2019re working on a collaborative project. I\\u2019m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, \\u201cWell, is there anything else I can eat? I\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHere.\\u201d I say here, \\u201cYou can make the toast.\\u201d I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I\\u2019m feeling more at home. I\\u2019m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I\\u2019m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There\\u2019s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I\\u2019ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon. She says, \\u201cNo, all we have is on the racks.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve chosen this chapter book I thought he would like and see it. I tell him that\\u2019s not the book I wanted to get him and describe the stories in the book that I wanted to give him. This builds a little bit more of a bridge between us.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Line Up\\u201d I\\u2019m in a doctor\\u2019s office but it\\u2019s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I\\u2019ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We\\u2019re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There\\u2019s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren\\u2019t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we\\u2019re looking at is the demographic of people who don\\u2019t believe in paying their bills online or don\\u2019t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can\\u2019t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we\\u2019re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they\\u2019re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It\\u2019s mostly elderly people. But there\\u2019s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It\\u2019s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I\\u2019m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, \\u201cMy appointment was at 8. It\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?\\u201d The receptionist who looks like my son\\u2019s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. This isn\\u2019t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone\\u2019s appointment was scheduled for 8am.\\u201d I feel like screaming at her but I don\\u2019t. I tell her that I understand it\\u2019s not her fault, but inside I\\u2019m frustrated and angry. I\\u2019m dizzy and starting to get a headache. I go back and sit down. Now it\\u2019s almost 5pm. There is a person that does the procedure I came for and I know they tend to leave a little bit earlier than the rest of the staff. I go back to the desk and say, \\u201cAm I still going to be able to get this done today?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you have two choices. You can wait until we open in the morning or I can give you this syringe and you can inject yourself at home. You still have to wait for your appointment.\\u201dI have this dissonance between my inner landscape which is angry and frustrated and tired and hungry and thirsty with what I\\u2019m saying to her. I tell her I\\u2019ll take the syringe full of medicine. Then I say, \\u201cWell wait a sec, if I have to stay anyways, is she going to be back tomorrow?\\u201d She tells me she is. I say, \\u201cWell nevermind then, I might as well wait and have her do it properly since I have to stay here overnight anyway.\\u201d She hands it to me anyway, and says, \\u201cWell take it just in case.\\u201d She hands me a syringe full of liquid medicine. I go back and realize that while I\\u2019ve been talking to her someone who arrived after me has gone in and got their appointment. I\\u2019m unbelievably agitated. I also realize this is just great, I\\u2019m going to have to stay overnight because you\\u2019re not allowed to go home. If you go home they put you back in the line up, so it\\u2019s a never ending cycle of having to wait from 8am until the end of the day when they can\\u2019t even take you. I push two chairs together and try and stretch my body across the chairs. My friend is doing the same thing. We take off our coats and use them as pillows and lie down. The night passes with me not being able to sleep because I\\u2019m too hungry and too thirsty. I wish I had water. I\\u2019m feeling that restlessness in your legs from not getting enough exercise. So, I start to walk around the building. I walk around twenty times and then come back in and it\\u2019s past midnight. I get back in the chairs and go to sleep. I sleep for maybe five minutes and am woken up. Some part of the chair is sticking in my back - it\\u2019s wooden and pressing in my thigh so I feel like I\\u2019m getting a bruise. I stay awake until I see the morning light coming into the building. I sit up in my chair and see the people come back to the desk. I feel like threatening them somehow and saying I\\u2019d better be first! That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Working Vacation\\u201d I\\u2019m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I\\u2019m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I\\u2019m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn\\u2019t look like that now. There\\u2019s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It\\u2019s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it\\u2019s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They\\u2019re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that\\u2019s really sturdy. I don\\u2019t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it\\u2019s that big. It\\u2019s on its side and they\\u2019re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don\\u2019t really know what they\\u2019re building but they\\u2019re quite busy with it. They\\u2019re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they\\u2019re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they\\u2019re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It\\u2019s a mixed group of boys and girls and it\\u2019s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn\\u2019t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I\\u2019m not really sure what I\\u2019m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it\\u2019s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they\\u2019re doing and it doesn't look like they\\u2019re really doing anything except running around, I\\u2019m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don\\u2019t enter. There\\u2019s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don\\u2019t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn\\u2019t matter in the dream, so I\\u2019ll use the pronoun \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that\\u2019s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they\\u2019ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they\\u2019re exactly the same length and width. I think that\\u2019s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they\\u2019re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they\\u2019re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you want the other shoe?\\u201d The child doesn\\u2019t respond to me. I\\u2019m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I\\u2019m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn\\u2019t. I just wait around and all I\\u2019m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I\\u2019m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I\\u2019m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it\\u2019s a little darker than it is outside. There\\u2019s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It\\u2019s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We\\u2019re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I\\u2019m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She\\u2019s around 8. I notice that she doesn\\u2019t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We\\u2019ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we\\u2019re in a meadow now. We\\u2019re still walking and the sun sets and we\\u2019re in twilight. I wonder if we\\u2019re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don\\u2019t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can\\u2019t sleep. I\\u2019m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they\\u2019re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter\\u2019s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter\\u2019s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what\\u2019s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I\\u2019m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I\\u2019m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that\\u2019s strange. I\\u2019m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, \\u201cI think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.\\u201d She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don\\u2019t have a bathing suit so I\\u2019m just wearing something that won\\u2019t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we\\u2019d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn\\u2019t very big. Then I\\u2019m not sure how we\\u2019re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they\\u2019re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Red Coat\\u201d I\\u2019m in the Central Hotel for a gathering. There are a lot of people. It\\u2019s packed. It feels dark and stuffy. I\\u2019m wearing a red jacket over a dress. Someone who works there takes my jacket and hangs it up for me. I go to sit down at a table. I\\u2019m supposed to meet people there. As I sit down, I realize that everyone is meeting there prior to moving next door for a wedding. I take my seat and am scanning the room for people I know. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I just sit in the seat. I\\u2019m waiting until we are going to be notified that we\\u2019re moving. Then it seems rather sudden that someone from the hotel circulates through the guests telling them it\\u2019s time to move. They\\u2019re saying things that cause us to be hasty and move quickly and not to linger. I get up and move with the flow of the crowd. We exit out the front door and immediately take a left and go into the door beside it, then up a long set of stairs and into a big room. The room we just left was crowded and stuffy but had kind of a homey atmosphere - the decor was of wood with wood posts that held the ceiling up and it had that well oiled hand hewn feel to it. This upstairs room is just one big rectangle that\\u2019s maybe hastily put together. No one sits and stays for a long time. It remains empty. There\\u2019s no warmth when you walk in. There's a long table. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m supposed to sit here. Again, I\\u2019m scanning the room for people I know. I see two people who used to live in my neighborhood and I thought were my friends. They know I\\u2019m there but keep to themselves and make no effort to come talk to me. I seem to know the people I\\u2019m sitting with but I can\\u2019t identify them in the dream. I realize we\\u2019re here for a reception. The servers bring food out. Everybody has the same plate of food. We eat without gusto. The servers take the food away and place dessert on the table. I pick at it. They sit down jugs of beer, but I don\\u2019t normally drink beer. I take a little bit in a cup and it tastes refreshing and very cold. I drink about half my cup. People are getting up out of their seats and moving into smaller groupings. There\\u2019s lively talk coming from these groupings. I feel isolated and unwelcome. I\\u2019m not sure what the reception is for. I get up and circulate a little. There\\u2019s a little dancing. I want to dance but there\\u2019s no one to dance with. I like the music and am feeling the dance in my body but there\\u2019s no one to share it with. I see someone who used to be a neighbor and go down to her. She says hello and talks with me for a few minutes. We sit down in chairs. I go to show her something on Facebook, but there\\u2019s no internet signal and my phone won\\u2019t load it. She gets bored and wanders away while I\\u2019m waiting. I just close my phone up and put it back in my purse. I go into the original room where I saw my old neighbors and they\\u2019re still involved in a conversation. They see me but don\\u2019t wave or beckon me over. I feel like I just want to go home now. Then I realize my red jacket is missing. I ask one of the staff if it\\u2019s possible to go downstairs and get it from the coat rack. They tell me that downstairs is now closed. It\\u2019s really cold out and I need my jacket. Now I'm unsure what to do. I stand by the doorway and another staff person comes up and says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve found three red jackets downstairs. Is one of these yours?\\u201d I think the first one is. It\\u2019s a felt jacket and it\\u2019s long. I put it on as though I recognize it. It\\u2019s comfortable and feels like it fits me. Then I see the other red jacket and think, \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s my grandfather\\u2019s coat.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m mistaken. The one I\\u2019m wearing is not mine. The noisy one is mine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell just keep the other one.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I can't do that, it\\u2019s not mine. It belongs to somebody.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, no one has claimed it. It\\u2019s been here for a long time.\\u201d I take it off and put on my grandfather\\u2019s coat. I\\u2019m holding it because he\\u2019s not giving me anywhere to put it. There are no hangers and he\\u2019s walking away. I feel uncomfortable that I have this coat that\\u2019s not mine. Then I go out the door because now they\\u2019re closing. I have this coat that doesn\\u2019t belong to me over my arm. I\\u2019m not sure how far to go with it, so I stand across the street because i can\\u2019t stay in the building.\"],[\"\\u201cFor a Little While\\u201d I\\u2019m in a village. It\\u2019s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don\\u2019t live in houses. It\\u2019s outside living. People\\u2019s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I\\u2019m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it\\u2019s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I\\u2019m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I\\u2019m waiting for her dad. I know he\\u2019s there but he\\u2019s invisible. He has a presence but I haven\\u2019t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we\\u2019re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I\\u2019m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It\\u2019s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there\\u2019s food you can eat with your fingers that\\u2019s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we\\u2019ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there\\u2019s privacy from everyone else\\u2019s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He\\u2019s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He\\u2019s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he\\u2019s still there in spirit but in the flesh he\\u2019s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we\\u2019re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She\\u2019s looking around. I think to myself, \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for the parents she doesn\\u2019t have.\\u201d I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I\\u2019m happy to look after her. She\\u2019s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter\\u2019s father. I miss that he can\\u2019t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.\"],[\"\\u201cGutting the Backpack - Lucid Dream\\u201d This is one of those lucid dreams where you just close your eyes for a moment and your body is rooted down despite the fact that you feel like you want to get up and move. I\\u2019m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There\\u2019s liquid or digestive juices with it. I\\u2019m horrified for a moment, then I think: \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s not an animal, that\\u2019s a backpack!\\u201d The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It\\u2019s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn\\u2019t open it with a zipper.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Symphony\\u201d I\\u2019m at my friends Maggie and Joey\\u2019s house, only it\\u2019s not their house, it\\u2019s the old Farm House. Maggie and Joey live there. I\\u2019ve gone up to visit them. Maggie has all kinds of little interesting things for us to do. We\\u2019re making jelly at one point. Then we go into a different room and are doing a craft. We\\u2019re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he\\u2019s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That\\u2019s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on with him because he\\u2019s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, \\u201cCome and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he\\u2019s wearing a tux.\\u201d I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some \\u201cdoing of the hair.\\u201d I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She\\u2019s got several things that she\\u2019s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don\\u2019t think anything of this. I think she\\u2019s just seeing how this will look or how these two items will look if you put them together. Then she says to me, \\u201cI can\\u2019t go. I\\u2019m really sick. I don\\u2019t feel up to this. But it\\u2019s something Joey really wants to do.\\u201d I ask her, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re sick?\\u201d She tells me she\\u2019s been sick for a really long time and she thinks that her time is limited. I feel this grief moving up through my feet, through my legs and into my heart. It kind of suspends all my decision making qualities. I\\u2019m just standing there trying to take this all in. i look at her really closely, looking for traces of truth, not of her words, but that her body is actually that sick. I\\u2019m looking at her skin and the sclera of her eyes. I\\u2019m trying to see what I have not noticed before and wasn\\u2019t aware of. Then I tell her I don\\u2019t want to go to the symphony and she should do this because it\\u2019s something special and they\\u2019ve been planning it for a long time. Then suddenly her hair is drawn back into a formal style with a bun at the back of her head. She\\u2019s wearing earrings that dangle down from her ears. She\\u2019s dressed in a strapless gown. She looks beautiful. We go back down the stairs. This time she disappears into the kitchen. I\\u2019m in the living room and Joey is standing there. I say, \\u201cI hope you guys have a really good time. This will be wonderful. You two look fabulous.\\u201d He comes over and gives me a hug. His face is overtop my left shoulder. I can feel that he\\u2019s crying. He says, \\u201cI hope you're still here when we get back.\\u201d Now I just feel kind of numb. I feel heavy. I no longer know what to do while they\\u2019re gone and I don\\u2019t want to stay in the house but I do. I look outside down the long farmhouse style driveway. All the earth looks frozen. The trees are bare. There\\u2019s no growth left in the ground. It\\u2019s nighttime. Even in the activity that was in the house of jamming things in jars and making preserves is tucked away. The house feels empty. I think, \\u201cMaybe I should just have a bath and go to bed.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe RV\\u201d I\\u2019m in an RV. It's kind of close quarters. There are at least three other people with me. We\\u2019re taking turns going to the back of the RV and using the washroom facilities. My belongings are in a suitcase tucked under the back bed and there is always something else on top of it or beside it, and always some waiting for someone else to get their things out first, so I can get to mine. It\\u2019s really cramped. Everything always seems rushed. I\\u2019m supposed to be hosting some kind of group discussion and I\\u2019ve been planning it for some time. There\\u2019s about twenty people involved and a certain day that it happens. In my dream, today is the day. I\\u2019m trying to use the washroom and get my clothes out, but there\\u2019s always someone else in there. I\\u2019m starting to feel rushed and I\\u2019m going to be late. I have this other book satchel that I brought on the trip and it had all the things I needed for the group discussion. It was all organized and I put it in there before the trip. There were pens I needed and a little tiny laptop and paper and a couple of other things that look like slim books, and they all fit in there nicely. I can\\u2019t find this. Someone has moved this. I\\u2019m looking for the people in the RV to ask them: \\u201cWho moved my thing? Where did you put it? I need it and have to go now.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time to go and I can\\u2019t find it. So this lady named Maria says, \\u201cHere, I have a few pencils and a pad of paper you can use.\\u201d I notice that hers have her name on everything. Everything I\\u2019m using says Maria. I think that was a really good idea that she had. I thank her and exit out the RV. I go back behind it to a long building and I enter the building. There\\u2019s a big room like a studio room. People are already there and sitting and waiting. One of the people that signed up, before I can get to the place they\\u2019ve left empty for me, he sits down in it. I wonder what he\\u2019s doing. He opens this paperback book and starts reading these really cryptic sentences. I think, \\u201cWhat does that even mean? I can\\u2019t even recognize any part of that sentence as relating to the subject matter we\\u2019re gathered here for.\\u201d Now while I was happy to give him some time leading the group, because he was part of this group, I see everyone else is looking puzzled and it\\u2019s my responsibility to facilitate. I think I should redirect this somehow. So I quietly shuffle around the outside of the circle and come down on my hands and He holds up the cover and it\\u2019s some completely different book, completely different topic. So I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, well, I had something scheduled before this, but my group didn\\u2019t show up or they were late. So I thought I would just take this time to get my stuff in anyway,\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t really do anything about this without completely disrupting and if they\\u2019re listening, I\\u201dll just walk away.\\u201d So I do. I leave him there to talk about whatever he was trying to talk about with my group. I get halfway back to the RV and three of the other group members have also left and run up behind me. They say, \\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don't know. He just usurped my group and is using it for his own purposes.\\u201d They say, \\u201cWell, we came to hear you, so we\\u2019re not going back,\\u201d and they leave. I get to the RV and open up the door. Maria is sitting at the driver\\u2019s seat. I tell her, \\u201cThank you very much for your things. I didn\\u2019t need them. I really like the nametags. Where did you get them?\\u201d I tell her that Brad was taking over the group and say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t he one of your students?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, he is. He shouldn\\u2019t be doing that. I\\u2019m going to go see what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d She leaves the RV. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m sitting in some kind of classroom. The desks are in rows. I\\u2019m sitting in a row, second desk from the front. There is no teacher in the room. The desk is empty. There\\u2019s nothing written on the board. The classroom door is open. I can see out into the hallway. Perpendicular to the open door is a long table and it has two women sitting at it. They\\u2019re busy writing things. I know that they are receptionists. There\\u2019s a little bit of a ripple of whispering that goes through the classroom. It sounds the way people would whisper when they\\u2019re alarmed - the uplifting and more staccato notes of the voices. I hear the word, \\u201csnakes.\\u201d All of a sudden I realize they must be talking about the two boa constrictors that are normally lazing around in the large tanks at the back of the room behind me in the back row. Without turning around to look to see if they are actually missing, I get up and start looking on the floor. I\\u2019m walking really slowly, so as not to alarm the snakes because they\\u2019re normally just lie there and not bother anyone as they rarely eat and they sleep a lot. I don\\u2019t see any lying around the perimeter of the classroom. I look out to where the desks are and where the secretaries are sitting. I see the really long one, it\\u2019s longer than the length of the table they\\u2019re seated at. It\\u2019s snuggled itself up against the baseboard. I\\u2019m thinking that if I just quietly go up to their desk and tell them not to be alarmed but they should move slowly and quietly then we can get the snake and return it to its home and this will be fine. Also I didn\\u2019t tell anybody else in the classroom because I don\\u2019t want a whole bunch of noise and people running around making a whole bunch of vibrations and stampede sounds on the floor. That would also alarm the snake. I just quietly get up and wander slowly towards the door. All of a sudden there\\u2019s this big alarm voice. People are yelling, \\u201cSnake!!!\\u201d at the top of their lungs. They\\u2019re climbing over each other and on top of the desks and are trying to get out. By this time, I\\u2019m standing right in front of the secretaries\\u2019 table. The secretaries leap out of their chairs and run the opposite direction. I see that the snake has rolled out so it\\u2019s halfway underneath the secretaries\\u2019 table now. But I\\u2019m still not alarmed. I turn around to go back into the classroom. I haven\\u2019t decided what to do. But I\\u2019m thinking there\\u2019s a handler\\u2019s fork at the back of the classroom by the cages. It\\u2019s got a six-foot long handle and a \\u201cU\\u201d on the top of it, and you can just pick the snake up with it and guide it back to its home. Normally the snakes will tolerate this. So I\\u2019m walking calmly towards the back of the room and I just turn around to make sure the snake is still under the table, and it\\u2019s not! It has accordioned itself up, so now instead of it having an eight-foot long body, it has a two-foot long body tightly coiled like a spring that\\u2019s loaded. I think that\\u2019s weird because constrictors don\\u2019t normally do that. In a split second, it has released the spring and I feel it hit my back and it\\u2019s biting right at the back of my heart. It has teeth now. The teeth won\\u2019t let go of me. I arch my back trying to break it\\u2019s grip. It doesn\\u2019t. I start shaking my upper body and arching and twisting my spine, trying to dislodge its teeth, and it does. It goes back down to the floor and now I\\u2019m running, getting up on the desks, still trying to get the fork so i can use it to defend myself. I\\u2019m hoping it\\u2019s not going to reload itself into that spring and lunge at me again.\"],[\"\\u201cOld School\\u201d I\\u2019m both in the place when it existed in its own time and again later as some kind of impermanent guest. In the dream, when it starts, I\\u2019m living there. Then it\\u2019s almost like the time I spent actually living there is a memory I\\u2019m unaware of as I re-enter it. The setting is a cleared area in a forest. The structures are really rustic; they\\u2019ve been hand-hewn and erected without machines. Everything has been done by hand. In fact, the floor inside one of the structures, the one I\\u2019m in, is made of gravel and wood chips and it\\u2019s quite chunky. I\\u2019m inside one of these structures in the village and looking out the window. I look at the other structures from the window and think, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s interesting. When they resurrected this, they put them in a different spot than they originally were.\\u201d I notice that the windows aren\\u2019t made of glass, but something a little opaque. I\\u2019m not quite sure what the material is. I\\u2019m inside one of these and it\\u2019s definitely the biggest of the structures and has two floors. I don\\u2019t go to the upper floor. I\\u2019m sitting on something and it\\u2019s not really a couch - it\\u2019s something stuffed with straw or horse hair. I\\u2019ve got a binder with me. I take it out and it\\u2019s study notes. I realize that I should have looked at these earlier because I actually have a lesson plan that\\u2019s due today. I'm not worried though. I think. \\u201cAh, that\\u2019s fine. I just have to sit here and sit still and do it.\\u201d So I start to read through the instructions and I hear some people talking in one of the other rooms. I stand up and walk over the rough floor and sure enough there are two other people. I\\u2019m wearing headphones at this point. One of the men is telling a story to the other man sitting there about how he got one of his jobs and a job he was quite happy with. He had been called in to fill in for someone else. He had some kind of project and no one had ever seen this kind of projector before. It put all of the work he needed to teach up on a whiteboard and it was really easy, it was compact, it was able to stream a whole bunch of different things into one machine. The way he told the story, people were marveling at it, asking him where he got it, etc. He had picked it up from somewhere exotic. They had called him in to do this kind of work in this school on a regular basis and they hadn\\u2019t hired anyone for years and years and years apparently, according to him. What he didn't realize is that my headphones were picking up the entire conversation he was having with his friend. His friend realized this and said, \\u201cI see we have someone else on the line.\\u201d He said, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s just Lynn.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re right, my headphones are picking it up, but I\\u2019m not Lynn.\\u201d Then I try to reach around to my ears and see if I can find some buttons that would turn off their conversation, although it had been interesting. I actually want quiet so I can do my own work. I leave the area where they had been making contact with each other. I realize as I was leaving that they weren\\u2019t even there and the whole thing was a hologram. I go back to my binder and sit on the stuffed cushion. I hear someone coming down the stairs from the upper floor. It\\u2019s a woman. I tell her that I\\u2019m going to do these lesson plans here. She just acknowledges that and drifts off. I don\\u2019t see her again. As I\\u2019m looking through the lesson plan, someone from my headphones asks me what I want to teach when I finish my program. I don\\u2019t know who it is - it\\u2019s like a disembodied voice. I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve worked with kids before and I really don\\u2019t think I want to put that much physical energy into my day, plus they get sick a lot. I really want to be in an environment where there\\u2019s not so much illness. Middle school, eh, that\\u2019s a lot of work, too, but in a different way. Maybe?\\u201d I realize that as I\\u2019m telling this, I want to teach high school because the environment is generally cleaner in terms of illness. You don\\u2019t need as much equipment because the kids don\\u2019t need to be entertained. I\\u2019m thinking that if I had the same technology that I overheard the man talking about in the other room, then the high school kids would be engaged and it\\u2019s really quite compact and doesn\\u2019t take up much space. I put this to voice and say, \\u201cYou know, I think I want to teach high school kids.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cRed Sand\\u201d I\\u2019m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I\\u2019m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it\\u2019s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it\\u2019s actually ending. She\\u2019s co-teaching with another person I\\u2019ve never seen. I think it\\u2019s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I\\u2019ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It\\u2019s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they\\u2019ve obviously already had their asana class and they\\u2019re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it\\u2019s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we\\u2019re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she\\u2019s white, if the whole class was like this or if it\\u2019s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it\\u2019s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I\\u2019m surprised to see her. She says, \\u201cNo, the whole class was like this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d So I ask her, \\u201cIs this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d There are six people. I think, \\u201cWow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.\\u201d Then I say to her, \\u201cI have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.\\u201d I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I\\u2019m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don\\u2019t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that\\u2019s leaving. As I\\u2019m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don\\u2019t even know what they are. But I\\u2019m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith\\u2019s flute looks like an obo, but it\\u2019s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it\\u2019s such beautiful music. You can tell they\\u2019ve played together for a really long time because they\\u2019re really tight together. They\\u2019re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there\\u2019s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I\\u2019ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, \\u201cGood, we\\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\\u201d The music has something to do with what they\\u2019ve been practicing in the class. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, \\u201cI hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.\\u201d We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we\\u2019re at the outskirts of town. He says, \\u201cLook what they\\u2019re going to put on this land.\\u201d He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he\\u2019s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he\\u2019s doing this, I\\u2019m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, \\u201cOh, I think there\\u2019s red clay under this.\\u201d I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, \\u201cLook. There\\u2019s red sand underneath here.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just spray painted. I say, \\u201cI don't think so, it looks real. It\\u2019s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.\\u201d He\\u2019s quiet and doesn\\u2019t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he\\u2019s adding onto it so it\\u2019s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.\"],[\"\\u201cHomeless\\u201d This dream just seems to start where I\\u2019m in a house that\\u2019s not mine. I was only able to bring a few of my things. One of the things is my spices. I found a big shelf for them. It\\u2019s deep enough to hold a spice bottle. There are eight shelves just spice bottle height apart. They\\u2019re pretty wide and there are two of them. I found them somewhere; somebody threw them in the garbage. I thought to myself: \\u201cThese would be perfect for my spices.\\u201d I am surprised when I see them on the wall and wonder who did that. Anyway, they\\u2019re there and I\\u2019m glad to see them. I\\u2019m looking around for my clothes and I don\\u2019t know where they are, but I\\u2019m sure I was able to bring them. The bed is as wide as it is long. It must be a King size bed. I realize that that\\u2019s where I\\u2019m sleeping. As I\\u2019m looking through the dressers for my clothes, someone comes in and it\\u2019s Keith who I know from the studio. He\\u2019s sleeping on the other part of the bed. I feel really uncomfortable with this arrangement, but I\\u2019m glad I at least have somewhere to sleep. I move as far to the opposite edge of the bed as I can. When he enters the room he tells me, \\u201cOh by the way, your clothes are in that dresser.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay good. I\\u2019ve got something to cook with and I\\u2019ve got some clothes.\\u201d I also have a wagon with a handle. I sleep but it\\u2019s a restless sleep. I\\u2019m too conscious of not rolling into him or something. The night passes. I see that the light at the windows is moving from dark to grey so I can get up now. As I\\u2019m getting out of bed, I accidentally lean my elbow on a part of his private parts and I feel really bad, but he doesn\\u2019t wake up. I get up anyway. I\\u2019m sorting through the clothes in the dresser, trying to put what\\u2019s mine in the wagon. I think, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s no room for the spices, I guess I\\u2019m going to have to leave them here.\\u201d So I leave the house adn go out onto the sidewalk. I\\u2019ve put too many things in the wagon and the sides aren\\u2019t high enough, so they keep falling out and getting dirty on the ground. But I don\\u2019t have anywhere to wash them. As I\\u2019m at the intersection, there\\u2019s a big mailbox. I don\\u2019t have a key for it. The postal service worker has opened the front of the mailbox so I can see what\\u2019s in my mailbox. It\\u2019s a whole bunch of CDs. I think, \\u201cOh, I mailed those to myself so I can still have them.\\u201d But the postal service worker says I\\u2019m not allowed to keep those in the mailbox and instructs me to take them out right then and there. I already don\\u2019t have enough room for my clothes and wonder how this is all going to fit in the wagon. I take all the clothes out and think, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re dirty anyway.\\u201d So I put them out on the ground and it\\u2019s a slushy snowy day. I put the CDs in the bottom of the wagon, then put the clothes back on top. It actually works out not too badly. I think, \\u201cWell, okay.\\u201d Then, I\\u2019m walking along the sidewalk. I\\u2019ve been invited to go to this staff meeting at the hospital where I used to teach. So I drag the wagon along with me, walk all the way to the hospital, enter the hospital, find the staff room and go in. it\\u2019s a Christmas party. They all have brought food to share. I don\\u2019t have anything so I feel conspicuous. The ladies, however, are really nice and they\\u2019re saying how much they miss my classes and what a good teacher I am. The feeling of being conspicuous and awkward starts to wear off a bit. This one lady says, \\u201cOh look at what I\\u2019ve got on DVD!\\u201d It\\u2019s one of my classes. She says, \\u201cHere, we can actually do the class. We haven\\u2019t had a cardio class in years.\\u201d So she puts in the DVD and a few of the ladies start doing it, but this makes me feel uncomfortable again. I leave that room and go into a different room. In this room are the teenage kids of the staff. They\\u2019re sitting around kind of bored and are starting to throw food around just for something to do. I think, \\u201cOh! I\\u2019ve got all these CDs in my wagon. Maybe that will entertain them and they\\u2019ll just sit here for a little bit.\\u201d I want to extend the time that people stay at this party because it\\u2019s warm in here. There\\u2019s a couch and there\\u2019s a little bit of food and I don\\u2019t have anywhere else I can go for the night. So, I start to sort out the CDs. I\\u2019m putting them in alphabetical order which is something I\\u2019ve never done in my entire life, but it organizes them well enough that the kids are starting to sort through them. In fact, all of them are quite occupied with this and they\\u2019re each picking out one that they like and playing it. Then one of the parents comes in and says it\\u2019s time to go. The kids start leaving one by one by one. I feel really sad. I see that it\\u2019s starting to get dark. There\\u2019s a dog in the room. I wonder because people are leaving and the dog is still there if it doesn\\u2019t belong to somebody. So, I follow it as it walks from that room into the bathroom. I see it has vomited all over the bathroom. There\\u2019s a little pile of dog shit on the counter. There\\u2019s vomit in the garbage pail. I\\u2019m wondering if the dog is sick or no one took it outside. So I'm asking people whose dog is this. Nobody claims it. More and more people are going. They don\\u2019t take any of the food with them. I\\u2019m starting to wonder if I could maybe stay there and no one would notice. I think I might as well take the risk. But what am I going to do with this dog because it\\u2019s shitting everywhere? I don\\u2019t want to go outside because I\\u2019m afraid if I go outside, I won\\u2019t be able to get back in. There's one woman left. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this your dog?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I say to her, \\u201cCould you not take it with you, though? Wouldn\\u2019t your kids love this dog? I think it\\u2019s really sick and it needs somebody.\\u201d She agrees to take it. They leave and I\\u2019m alone in there. I\\u2019m starting to gather my CDs together in a pile. Every time I stack them, they fall. None of them will stay in a stack anymore. I take a big giant knife and cut them in half, then I cut them in half again. I put the pieces back in the wagon. I put my clothes over top, but they seem to have disappeared. I wonder if the kids have taken them. There\\u2019s only a few clothes left; it\\u2019s mostly just these pieces of CDs. While I\\u2019m sitting there, one other person comes out. He must have been in the bathroom. He asks me if I need any help. I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, I have some interesting news for you that you might want to hear.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cRemember your friend Amy?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d He says, \\u201cShe\\u2019s been accused of lying about other people\\u2019s dreams. I thought you might want to know that.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, I guess it came back around.\\u201d I\\u2019m sad for her and wonder what\\u2019s wrong with her that she does that to get attention. I guess that\\u2019s good that people know I wasn\\u2019t lying.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Courtroom\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure when this dream starts if I\\u2019m just observing and then become one of the people or if I was one of the people all along. I\\u2019m in a courthouse. I can see it from the outside - the big wide stairs, the huge pillars, the giant doors, the big spacious hallways that are made of marble, the floor is really slippery and looks wet but it is not. This is the part where I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m just observing or if I\\u2019m one of the people. In the hallway there are just a couple of people. I\\u2019m walking through it trying to find some justice. I can feel this tight ball of outrage mixed with grief in the middle of my chest. I wonder which courtroom I\\u2019m supposed to be in. as I\\u2019m looking at each door, I\\u2019m looking for some sign that this will be where my case will be heard. There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there\\u2019s four, then eight, then sixteen; they\\u2019re multiplying exponentially. Then they\\u2019re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it\\u2019s all just men. Then there are so many that there\\u2019s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They\\u2019re only inches away from me and now there\\u2019s even more. I\\u2019m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, \\u201cThese aren't regular men. Look, this man\\u2019s gay.\\u201d As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there\\u2019s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They\\u2019re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there\\u2019s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that\\u2019s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they\\u2019re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that\\u2019s the end of it. But then they regain their footing and they start to make some space again as they\\u2019re running down the next hallway. Then I\\u2019m in the crowd, I\\u2019m not just watching. I\\u2019m looking for a place where we can blend in so the people who are chasing us won\\u2019t recognize us. Or is there a door that isn\\u2019t just a courtroom but actually leads to someplace we can hide. So this goes on. The hallways are endless. There\\u2019s nowhere to blend in because someone keeps recognizing us. Then at one point, there\\u2019s enough distance between us and the people chasing us. I open one of the doors. You can hardly see that it\\u2019s a door because it\\u2019s a white door within a white wall. I open it up and run in. it\\u2019s got a push-in button lock. I can feel somebody on the other side of the door. The door handle is in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to push the button, but the person is turning the door so that the button keeps popping out. It keeps happening over and over and over again. Then I think this is it and I\\u2019m done for. Then I hear this voice on the other side saying, \\u201cPlease let me in!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAlright it\\u2019s not someone trying to chase, but someone trying to hide.\\u201d I open the door up and this big round man comes in. I think we\\u2019re not going to fit in here because he\\u2019s so big. But we do. Now he's in front of me. I think to myself that if someone opens the door, they\\u2019re not even going to see me because he\\u2019s so big he\\u2019s filling up the space. Then I can feel that his body feels soft and doughy, it\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s absorbing me. I think, \\u201cWell, at least it\\u2019s not uncomfortable.\\u201d Then I hear the crowd and the noises of the feet pounding and the yelling. They\\u2019re getting closer and closer and closer. Then they\\u2019re right outside the door. I feel them going a little away and then they\\u2019re gone in the distance. Then it\\u2019s quiet. I start to let out my breath. My heart\\u2019s pounding so hard that I can\\u2019t breathe. It starts to subside a bit. I get an inhale again. After some minutes, I\\u2019m starting to breathe again. Both of us are scared to open the door. It\\u2019s pitch dark in here because there is no justice here. It\\u2019s quiet for long enough that the building sounds empty. I think the fight has just gone on outside. It didn\\u2019t disappear, it\\u2019s somewhere. We open the door, go into the dark hallways. There\\u2019s no one in the building. It sounds like no one is in here. We walk down the hallways until we see the door back to the street. The street is dark. This other person just disappears. I\\u2019m walking and wondering where to go. Then I see one shop that looks open. It looks like a curio shop. I open the door. It has one of those cowbells on the top and makes the cowbell noise. An elderly woman comes out. She tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m over here if you need me.\\u201d She disappears into the piles and piles of stuff. I go off into the room to the right. I don\\u2019t have any money. At first it just looks like junk, broken, dusty, dirty things. I don\\u2019t even really want to sort through them. Then as I look at things more closely I think it\\u2019s not just piles of junk, but actually antique furniture. You can see where she started to decorate the furniture to make it look like a store with lamps and tablecloths and little ornaments around those. But as no one was buying anything, she\\u2019s collecting and hoarding them. Eventually you couldn\\u2019t tell where the arrangement was and where it was just things upon things upon things. But I become interested in the layers because it\\u2019s the furniture I\\u2019m trying to decipher. In one corner of one room, I\\u2019ve sorted my way into it. I\\u2019m interested in this desk because it looks like there is a secret compartment in it somewhere. So I\\u2019m moving things around, taking all this stuff off it...broken picture frames and I wonder who these people are and setting them somewhere else. I\\u2019m moving the lamps. There are too many broken things that I can\\u2019t tell what\\u2019s what. But once I move a lot of the broken stuff, I can start to see actual things. I move the lamp. There\\u2019s a kitchen utensil and it\\u2019s old enough that I don\\u2019t recognize it. I\\u2019m wondering what it was used for. Then I\\u2019ve cleared enough of the space on top of the desk that I can open it. It\\u2019s one of those roll tops that rolls back into itself. Now there\\u2019s stuff inside and it\\u2019s just crammed with stuff! So I have to move all these other things. Suddenly there\\u2019s a man beside me. I recognize him as this guy who I talked to for a little while then realized he wasn\\u2019t a very nice person so I stopped talking to him. Every word he said was so insincere. He says to me, \\u201cLook, there are two little pieces of wood at the back of this. If you lift them up, it exposes a secret compartment.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, how did you know this? There was so much stuff in front of this.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been in here for a really, really long time.\\u201d Then he goes back to sitting on the floor. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s a prisoner there and he\\u2019s trapped somehow. I\\u2019m looking to see what was in this compartment. It\\u2019s cartons, like the kind of boxes that look like shoe boxes but are made of pretty material...or maybe it\\u2019s wallpaper over cardboard. But you see older ladies with them. They wrap things in material and tissue paper so dust moths don\\u2019t eat them. There are a whole bunch of these stacked in here. I wonder if this actually belongs to the old lady who has this store. I find her. I go into the other room and find her and say, \\u201cOne of the desks in the other room has a secret compartment.\\u201d She looks at me with some surprise and affection and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019ve found it!\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell let me know if you need any help, I\\u2019ll be over here.\\u201d I think she doesn\\u2019t mind that I\\u2019m looking through all this stuff and sorting it. I go back into the first room and am thinking that it\\u2019s okay to look through all these things! I\\u2019m sorting them into different piles. I leave the desk open the way I found it. I go across the room. The man is still there and he has his eyes closed like he\\u2019s trapped. It looks like he can\\u2019t move away from that spot. In this one corner of the room, I\\u2019m sorting through things and I find this beautiful string of lights. There are only five lights on it. It looks like hand-blown glass. The blue is a beautiful color. In fact, you can see the different elements in the blue that would have been exposed when the glassblower was blowing it to make the bulb. You can see bits of orange and terracotta and different shades of this deep carnival royal blue. I\\u2019m admiring them and thinking, \\u201cWow, here\\u2019s this beautiful thing hidden amidst all of this junk.\\u201d I set them carefully aside. Now I find a picture with a round oval frame. It looks like me when I was a little girl. I set that beside the string of blue lights. I wonder what else is in here that maybe once belonged to me when I was young. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cEscape\\u201d I\\u2019m in a grey cement building. It looks like the Hoover Dam - it\\u2019s that tall and made of cement like that. It\\u2019s dark. There\\u2019s water on the floor, about an inch of it, and it feels damp and cold. I\\u2019m inside with three people. We\\u2019re taking turns sleeping in shifts. We can only sleep for a maximum of eight minutes. We\\u2019re practicing a rotation that we can take this copper wire thing and roll it up into a key. It\\u2019s kind of shaped like a paperclip. We have to take it out of its shape and roll it into two other things within a certain amount of time. One of the shapes, you take one end and it ends up looking something like a flower. And the other, I\\u2019ve already forgotten what it looks like. We\\u2019re really, really tired. Everybody wants to sleep more than we are, but we can\\u2019t because we\\u2019re training ourselves to escape this place. We\\u2019ve got this old lumpy mattress on the floor so it keeps you off the water. There\\u2019s one set of sheets. The person who\\u2019s sleeping gets to stretch out and the rest of us are just sitting on something like one of those trundle buggies or wheely carts where you put things in them for shopping and they have a handle. Homeless people use them or the elderly. So we\\u2019re sitting on that to keep us up out of the water. So you not only have to be able to snap out of your sleep quickly, you also have to be dropped into your sleep quickly. If we can do all of this within eight minutes - fall asleep, wake up, fold the wire into the two different shapes - then we\\u2019re sure we can manage our escape. Everybody has to go through the rotation and there are four of us all together. So we do this. It repeats in the dream four times. One person has a really hard time waking up and it\\u2019s making all of us anxious. We\\u2019re shaking her and saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta get up! You\\u2019ve gotta get up!\\u201d She finally wakes up. We make her go through that a couple more times so she is waking up at the proper time. When she does, we take the sheets of the bed, but we have to leave the top cover on so it looks like people are still sleeping there because there\\u2019s somebody that comes around and checks and if they realize we\\u2019re gone before we\\u2019re all the way out of the building then we might get caught. So we have to practice taking the sheet off without disturbing the top cover. I\\u2019m actually quite good at this. We do it and I\\u2019m instructing the others, telling them how to do it. We do it, fold it up and put everything in this trundle buggie and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cGoats and Ethics\\u201d I\\u2019ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I\\u2019m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I\\u2019m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, \\u201cHmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really find any. Then I decide I\\u2019m not worried about it because I\\u2019ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I\\u2019m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I\\u2019ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don\\u2019t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I\\u2019m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He\\u2019s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, \\u201cYou have to see this, come with me.\\u201d We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn\\u2019t a yard; it\\u2019s a pool of water. But it doesn\\u2019t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, \\u201cThis is just amazing. You have to see this.\\u201d We bend down and look into the lake. She says, \\u201cLook what I found.\\u201d I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it\\u2019s not made of cement; it\\u2019s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, \\u201cLook! It\\u2019s a goat path.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don\\u2019t understand how it\\u2019s for goats.\\u201d So we\\u2019re kneeling at the side and she says, \\u201cLook.\\u201d I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re post holes.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.\\u201d She presses something and they start to go up - they\\u2019re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, \\u201cAt one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.\\u201d I think, \\u201cI wonder what the value is in that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell they would have used it when they were threatened.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, then, still I don\\u2019t understand what the goats did.\\u201d Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it\\u2019s not wood that things are made of and the reason they\\u2019ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, \\u201cWow, this is incredible.\\u201d Now other students are coming out and it\\u2019s 4:30. I realize it\\u2019s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can\\u2019t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can\\u2019t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Spectre\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house on A. Street. There\\u2019s some kind of renovation going on. There are also a lot of people. I don\\u2019t understand what they\\u2019re there for. I\\u2019m circulating through the various floors and chatting with people. It\\u2019s like someone invited me to an open house and I don\\u2019t know any of the people there so I\\u2019m just casually circulating around, except that I\\u2019m completely familiar with the house. So I don\\u2019t feel as awkward as I would normally in a place where I know zero people. I\\u2019m an outsider to the conversations. So I go upstairs then I go back downstairs. I sit on the porch for a little while. I\\u2019m an outsider to that conversation. Then I go into the main floor where the living room and kitchen are, and the same thing, I\\u2019m an outsider. Then I come back outside and I sit on the front steps. I turn around because something in the conversation peaks my interest. I look at them and I see this spectre. It\\u2019s black and has not necessarily a malevolent presence, but ominous. It\\u2019s leaning against the bricks. Other peoples\\u2019 eyes are facing it, but they\\u2019re continuing on with their conversations as though it\\u2019s not there. So I think they can\\u2019t see it. It makes me feel concerned because it\\u2019s like the usher that walks you down the aisle and it feels like death is the play that\\u2019s about to start. I wonder who is it there for? Then, on the lawn, there are a lot of children starting to gather. They're just playing a game with a stick - throwing the stick and catching it. There\\u2019s a ball that they\\u2019re kicking through a hoop. Now I wander through the house again. This time instead of just meandering, I\\u2019m looking to see if there\\u2019s any imminent danger or someone that\\u2019s unwell and might need some help. I go through the floors looking for that. When I get back down to the main floor I realize I need to use the washroom. I wander over that way. There\\u2019s somebody in it, so I stand outside and wait. When he comes out, he\\u2019s quite a chatty fellow. He starts trying to engage me in conversation, but I\\u2019m very uncomfortable because my bladder feels full and it\\u2019s pressing against me and I don\\u2019t want to engage right now, I just really want to use the washroom. But he\\u2019s oblivious to this. By this time I\\u2019m hopping from one foot to the other and saying, \\u201cExcuse me, please just one moment while I use the washroom.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t stop talking. I just go in the washroom anyway and close the door. I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and he comes in as though I\\u2019m not on the toilet and just continues the conversation! He\\u2019s talking about the renovations that he\\u2019s done to the bathroom. He\\u2019s actually quite impassioned and seems oblivious to me sitting on the toilet. Now my bladder\\u2019s been relieved so I\\u2019m able to focus on what he\\u2019s saying. It\\u2019s actually really interesting how he has renovated the bathroom on a budget, but it looks quite nice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHmm, note to self, a couple of these are good ideas!\\u201d He wanders out and I finish taking care of my needs in the bathroom, washing my hands. I\\u2019m looking at how clean this bathroom is. It\\u2019s very nice but really tiny. All the grout is white and it\\u2019s got a lot of decorations, but everything is clean and dust free. I\\u2019m thinking that there\\u2019s something unusual about the man and his hair or head. He\\u2019s still standing outside the bathroom door chatting. I\\u2019m looking at his face. The skin around his face kind of grows right into his hair; he doesn't have a hairline. There is a lot of hair growing out of his ears, kind of the way a hedgehog\\u2019s face continues to grow into its fur coat. And with his stature, he looks like a hobbit. He has the engaging warm friendly countenance of the hobbits. He\\u2019s still chatting away. Now somebody else is interested in his conversation. I go back through the living room and out onto the porch. The spectre is still there. Now it\\u2019s starting to get dark; it\\u2019s twilight, but the kids are still playing and no one has come to collect them. They vary in age from five to maybe eight, so they shouldn\\u2019t be out in the dark on their own. I\\u2019m wondering who\\u2019s going to claim them. I stay. They\\u2019re still playing happily. One of them gets too close to the road. As part of the game, they lay down flat on their belly right at the edge of the road. I\\u2019m scared that a car is going to come around and not see them because they\\u2019re flat and it\\u2019s starting to get dark. I\\u2019m wondering at what point I should intervene. I\\u2019m watching for traffic and looking to see if cars are coming. In that period of time, the child gets back and goes to the lawn where it\\u2019s safe. Now there are people starting to gather at the right hand corner of the house. I see the spectre start to move. It has a scythe and suddenly the scythe gets really long and the handle is in the spectre\\u2019s hand. The spectre is reaching it up over its head and over to the other side because it looks like it\\u2019s intending to scoop someone with the scythe and blade standing there. I feel my body erupting in a big \\u201cNo!\\u201d from the center of my being and I don\\u2019t know who it\\u2019s scooping. The crowd at the side of the house meld together - the people are indistinguishable from each other and I still don\\u2019t know who it\\u2019s claimed.\"],[\"\\u201cLittle Animals with Trunks on the Movie Set\\u201d This dream starts at the restaurant where I worked while at university. It\\u2019s a continuation of another dream where I heard they were hiring and I brought my application in. It starts by me meeting there with a bunch of other people I used to hang around with when I worked there. We are meeting there and it\\u2019s a Sunday night. We\\u2019re going to see a concert and the reason we\\u2019re meeting there is because the manager or one of the bartenders (I\\u2019m not sure who) has picked up a bulk purchase of tickets and we have access to them as employees at this bulk rate. I\\u2019ve been included in this. I\\u2019m feeling hopeful that I have a job there because I\\u2019ve been included. So, it\\u2019s shift change and I'm sitting at the bar with everyone else. Some of the staff are eating, which is typical - they\\u2019re getting their meal at the end of their shift. Some staff come in earlier and eat their staff meal before their shift starts. So there are a lot of people around and it\\u2019s a festive atmosphere. The people that have finished their shift are buoyant because they\\u2019re counting their tips. The people that are starting their shift are buoyant because there\\u2019s an anticipation of the money they\\u2019re going to make. There\\u2019s always good music playing there. I see people I went to highschool with. Their uniforms are all fresh and I can tell they\\u2019ve just been hired that day. I have a conversation with two of them. The tickets go around and I take mine. We\\u2019re figuring out who\\u2019s going to carpool with who and in what car. We\\u2019re waiting for the schedule to go up because it\\u2019s Sunday night. George, the manager, disappears into the back and somebody comments that he\\u2019s taking a long time to work on it. The crowd is thinning because people have finished their meal or left with their ticket and carpool or are on the floor starting to take care of their section. I\\u2019m still waiting to see if I\\u2019m on it because I\\u2019ve been included in this. George hasn\\u2019t come out from the back yet. I ask the owner who personally gave me a package with my ticket in it. Now I remember that they also had a small birthday celebration for me. Several people have given me a birthday gift and I didn\\u2019t expect this. I ask the owner if he knows if I\\u2019m on the schedule. He says he doesn\\u2019t know. He takes my hand and then leaves. One of the other managers is standing there, so I ask him. He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He has a sad look on his face. I feel really dejected and don\\u2019t even want to go to the concert now. I\\u2019m wondering why not only everybody who used to work with me has been re-hired, but these other people that went to highschool with and who never even worked there before have been hired. I leave. I get on the bus to go home. The bus is leaving and it does go down P. Road, but it stops and I disembark. It\\u2019s not just a bus stop, it\\u2019s an intersection of all different kinds of transportation. There\\u2019s a big ship at the dock. There are skateboards. There\\u2019s a snowmobile. There are other things I don\\u2019t remember. At first I choose a skateboard and it\\u2019s interesting because it is snowing. I\\u2019m surprised that as I go up a hill with snow that I can maneuver on this - it\\u2019s a combination of pressing my right foot down, then the left foot lifts up a little, and then you use your body weight and your center of gravity to heave it forward - it\\u2019s similar to skiing. I get up this very small hill then get some momentum and it\\u2019s going along in the snow. When I look down I can see the snowmobile tracks in the snow and they\\u2019ve hardened a bit in the cold, and it\\u2019s actually helping my skateboard to move along. I do this for a little while then get off the skateboard. Now I\\u2019m on some other kind of vehicle. It\\u2019s flying over the snow and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It has a steering mechanism. I am zooming along. It\\u2019s wide and there are a couple other people on it. I look over to the side and there are trees flying by. I can see an animal through the trees. I can\\u2019t figure out what kind of animal it is. At first I think it\\u2019s a warthog. Then I think it\\u2019s too big to be a warthog. Then I get a better glimpse of it. You know when things are speeding by and at first you can\\u2019t see something but then it\\u2019s almost like the thing that are speeding by are so fast that it looks like a motion picture and you can see what the other object is? It looks like a hippopotamus except it has wings and a trunk. Then I see all these other strange pictures. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow! This is the set from a Harry Potter movie!\\u201d I get excited about this. We get off at the next stop. Now my son is there and he gets off with me. I say, \\u201cDid you see that?!\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe animal through the trees!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, what did you see?!\\u201d I describe the process of first thinking it was a warthog then realizing what it was. He says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go take a look at the set!\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYou know what? If that\\u2019s the movie set, then we could actually rewatch that movie and look carefully at that scene through the trees and maybe see us flying by.\\u201d He gets really excited about this, too, and we decide to do that when we get home. Then we walk back the way we came on the vehicle. It\\u2019s taking us a little while to walk because we need to go back to that intersection of vehicles in order to get on one that will take us home. We\\u2019re almost there. We\\u2019re walking down the little hill that I skateboarded up with the snow. Then we decide to go off to the left and see if we can see anything else from the movie set. We get closer to it and there are extras and the caterers and those kinds of people milling about and doing their thing. There\\u2019s a commotion. We follow along with the crowd so we can see what the commotion is about. It\\u2019s a horse and it\\u2019s kicking another horse. I\\u2019m horrified. It\\u2019s just awful. I can hear the people on the set gasping and saying, \\u201cTake that thing out of the horse costume!\\u201d What\\u2019s happening is one of these trunked creatures is dressed up as a horse and the other horse thinks that the first horse\\u2019s spirit is bad so it\\u2019s kicking it because it doesn\\u2019t understand it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s another creature in it. They get the first horse calmed down and they remove the horse skin from the other one and put it into this pen. But the pen is a pit. There are a whole bunch of them in it and it\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s so inhumane. They\\u2019re all writhing around and all you can see are these little trunks. It\\u2019s so awful I wake up because I can\\u2019t stand looking at this or seeing this.\"],[\"\\u201cMessage\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house. On the kitchen table are two notepads in a wicker basket. They have an eclectic assortment of many notes I made while I was on the phone, little lists, self-reminders, passwords, numbers. One is entirely all of this. I\\u2019m almost at the end of blank paper in it. I look through both of them to make sure everything has been covered or written down somewhere else or put where it\\u2019s supposed to be. One of them is like this and I know I can throw it away. The other one has a note in the middle of it. I can\\u2019t remember all of it, but there was the word, \\u201cisa\\u201d or \\u201cesa\\u201d with three numbers above and three numbers below. I can\\u2019t throw this one away; I have to keep it. In fact, I\\u2019ve been meaning to tear out just that one piece of paper because it\\u2019s proof. What it\\u2019s proof of, I\\u2019m not sure. But in the dream, my biological mother has been telling lies about me. It\\u2019s abusive. None of it is true. I\\u2019ve done a lot of self-healing and self-parenting around that and accepted that she will always tell those kinds of lies and there will be some who believe her, but I\\u2019ve moved on and am living my own life. But when I go through these notebooks, I see this one note and am shocked to see it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this proves that i was telling the truth!\\u201d So this is why I do suddenly want to keep this note even though I hadn\\u2019t thought of all those wrongs she did to me in so long. Somebody comes along and moves the basket around and takes the notebooks before I\\u2019ve had a chance to put this one notebook in my pocket. I\\u2019m trying to find out who moved them and what they did with them. There are renovations being done in the next room in the house - the living room. There\\u2019s a man in there wearing white coveralls - the type that painters wear. He\\u2019s up on a ladder and he\\u2019s starting to cut in the edges around the ceiling with the brush the way painters do before they use the roller to the walls. I notice that he\\u2019s got the top half of a toolbox - like the red metal toolboxes people carry around with the insert you can lift out with a handle and some of the heavier tools stay in the bottom. He has this, but instead of it being full of screwdrivers and whatnot, he\\u2019s cemented up the carrying part of it so all that\\u2019s accessible is just this handle. I ask him, \\u201cHave you seen the notebooks from the kitchen?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh yeah, they\\u2019re in that basket over there.\\u201d I look and he\\u2019s pointing to the insert from the red metal toolbox that\\u2019s been cemented up. I say, \\u201cHow long ago did you do this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cEh, about five or ten minutes.\\u201d I ask him if the cement is still wet enough that I can break it open and get my notes out of there because I really need one of them. He\\u2019s indifferent and says, \\u201cEh, you can if you want. I don\\u2019t care.\\u201d Then he continues his cutting with the paintbrush. I\\u2019m indecisive. I think if it\\u2019s in there, it\\u2019s in there forever and the cement is going to harden momentarily. Then I decide that I do want them. So I look around for something to break the cement with. He has a putty knife with a wide blade. I\\u2019m pressing it into the top where the two seams meet. The cement is still kind of wet. I get both notebooks out and am looking through both of them. I don\\u2019t see the one note anymore. I go through them again. It\\u2019s still not there. Then I go through them again, really slowly, one page at a time. It\\u2019s painstaking; it\\u2019s tedious. I\\u2019m starting to feel frustrated with this. I can\\u2019t remember if I find it or not.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and it seems like some kind of celebration. It almost feels like a Christmas Open House or an informal reception of some sort. I\\u2019m wandering through the house looking for somebody I know. I don't see anybody when I go through the first three rooms. When I get to the backroom, I see my friend Kenny. He\\u2019s sitting with one of his sisters and both of his parents. I\\u2019m comfortable with them so I stay there. I don\\u2019t mingle. I just have conversations in turn with each of them until the event starts to wind down and the crowd starts to thin. Kenny leaves. I\\u2019m still taking to his sister; we\\u2019re having a bonding conversation about being the mother of boys. It\\u2019s time for her to go home and it\\u2019s just the parents left. They ask me if I would like a ride and I accept. I get into the car. I don\\u2019t know what happens to the mom, maybe we dropped her off earlier. I\\u2019m in the car now with the dad. He says to me, \\u201cIs it okay if we stop somewhere because I need to pick something up?\\u201d He tells me where it is and I say, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s only five minutes from my house.\\u201d We pull up and it\\u2019s a really tall apartment building. There\\u2019s a circular approach to it and he pulls up the car to the front of the main door. Then he says, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize you can\\u2019t park here. If I stay in the car while it\\u2019s running, do you mind going up and getting the parcel?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d He describes to me the floor that it\\u2019s on and tells me that I have to go down to the end of the hallway and it\\u2019s the last door on the right. He says it should be open. I follow the instructions and end up where he tells me. The door is open. I go into the hallway and see a parcel there and it\\u2019s bright orange, the kind of orange you\\u2019d see on a construction site. I pick up the parcel and exit the door backwards. I leave my left arm in the doorway, so it doesn\\u2019t make a loud noise as it closes. I\\u2019m starting to feel strange about being in somebody\\u2019s apartment when I don't know them and picking something up when I don\\u2019t know what it is. I\\u2019m walking down the hallway feeling kind of edgy. I see two people coming towards me from the end of the hallway. I overhear snippets of their conversation and realize they live in the apartment I just exited. I take note of what they look like. It\\u2019s a man and a woman. The woman is wearing a long nice pretty dress. They are both brown skin. Her hair is dark and pulled back in a bun. As I start to go down the stairs I\\u2019m feeling really unsure about what I\\u2019ve just done. When I get to the car, I share this with the dad. Before he answers or addresses my concerns, I see on the front seat of the car a folded up front page of a newspaper. The picture on it is a picture of my face as I\\u2019m running away from a building and the headline is \\u201cThis Place Has Been Robbed!\\u201d Now I am really distressed. I\\u2019m asking him. He told me it was okay what\\u2019s going on here but while I\\u2019m talking, he starts driving quickly away. Out from the underground parking lot comes a great big bright yellow ocre Cadillac. It\\u2019s the kind of Cadillac really old people drive. It\\u2019s really long and wide and doesn\\u2019t fit in parking spots anymore. I can see through the front windshield, the same man and woman I met in the hallway. I can hear the sound of the engine of the car roaring to live. It\\u2019s driving really quickly. They\\u2019re tearing up the road behind us. The dad speeds up and says he thinks he can lose them. He drives through the downtown to the other side of the city where there is a suburban area. It\\u2019s a quieter place. You can feel the quiet. It\\u2019s dark, nighttime. We drive up a really steep hill and he tells me to get out here and I'll be safe. I don\\u2019t know where I am in regards to my own house. I know I don\\u2019t feel safe, yet he doesn\\u2019t even turn the car off and everything happens so quickly that I feel like I have to get out now and don\\u2019t have time to ask questions because the time we gained on the car chasing us might be lost. I feel threatened as if my life is at stake. On the way I told him I wanted to go to the police. I don\\u2019t remember if he replied. Everything was happening so quickly. I get out of the car. I don't have the package - it\\u2019s not mine and I didn\\u2019t want it. I go in between two buildings - it's a really narrow asphalt pathway. Once I get behind the buildings, I\\u2019m in a square courtyard with all these big houses backed onto it. I\\u2019m standing there in the dark. It\\u2019s a quiet cushy kind of feeling there. I think, \\u201cAlright, I gotta get my bearings. I don\\u2019t have anything with me. How can I get the police and explain what actually happened because I\\u2019m being wrongly accused of something I was tricked into doing. Where is a phone? It\\u2019s nighttime. I need somewhere to sleep but I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019ll be safe.\\u201d My eyes adjust to the dark and I see I\\u2019m at the top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill is the woman from the hallway and in the car. She looks at me and I can tell that she recognizes me. She looks like she\\u2019s getting ready to run up the hill. But I have momentum on my side, so I run down the hill faster and faster and faster. My idea is to tackle her, to take her out, and then keep running until no one can find me. But she guesses what I\\u2019m going to do and ducks under. I roll through the air and we both land on our feet. We\\u2019re squaring off at each other, circling around and around. This is where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Accommodations\\u201d I\\u2019m by the bay, but it\\u2019s not the bay I normally sail from; there is grass around the banks. But it\\u2019s still a place where people tie up their boats and get out and into their cars. It kind of looks like a marina in Wilson, New York. My friend has her boat there and she\\u2019s sitting at a picnic table with a few other people. There is a riding lawn mower and I get on it because I\\u2019ve never sat on one before. She says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you start it up?\\u201d I say, \\u201cIs it okay?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYeah, just start it up the way you would a car.\\u201d I see a key in the ignition and I start it. The engine turns over, it\\u2019s on, and we\\u2019re moving forward. At first i\\u2019m just driving it on the grass, just getting used to it. It looks like the grass has been freshly cut, so I\\u2019m not making any marks on the grass with it. Then, there\\u2019s something in the middle of the grass on a slope - a garden. I see that the grass is taller around the garden and now the lawn mower is leaving marks. So I think it would be irresponsible of me just to have driven this around haphazardly and to ruin the look of it. So I start going up and down the grassed area in an organized way. I\\u2019m trying to get close to the garden without cutting the flowers. My friend has now gotten out and gone back to her boat for something. We finished eating at the picnic tables and she\\u2019s tidying that stuff up. I realize I need to put the lawn mower back where I found it. There are a couple of spots that look really, really bad now because I didn\\u2019t quite finish going up and down properly. So I\\u2019m trying to cut across with those spots close to the garden and there\\u2019s another one a bit further away. I think I do this...I don\\u2019t remember turning the lawn mower off or parking it somewhere. The next thing I remember is I\\u2019m in a car. It\\u2019s pulling up outside an apartment building and I\\u2019ve been sleeping in it. I\\u2019m really, really, really tired. I\\u2019m in the backseat. Luke is driving. The car stops in front of the apartment building. A few moments later, a boy comes down and he opens the door to the backseat. This is strange because the front seat is empty and I thought he would have sat in the front, but he doesn\\u2019t. He sits in the back and now I can\\u2019t sleep, so I sit up. He\\u2019s laughing at me for sleeping or being in the back seat. He thinks it\\u2019s really funny. It\\u2019s Luke\\u2019s son and I can tell because they have the exact same face. We drive over to Lynn\\u2019s house and pull up in the driveway and get out. Luke disappears into the house. I go into the garage, but I go in through the front door. I\\u2019ve been gradually moving my stuff over there. Lynn has agreed to lend me her garage for a little while because I have nowhere to live. My son and I are staying there for a little bit. We have piled up cardboard boxes all over the garage. I\\u2019ve arranged them in a way so they form almost a full wall. I\\u2019ve left a little bit of space between the top of the boxes and top of the garage so light comes in from the rest of the garage. It gives us a place of privacy and a little bit of darkness if we want to sleep. Some time passes by, like three or four weeks. On the other half of the garage, Lynn has set up a gym/spa. She has machines and a room made of cedar strips that you can go in. There's an interesting way of making the cedar room into a sauna by pouring a cup of water into a drawer and then closing the drawer, then out of the spout comes steam. There\\u2019s another that releases steam practically through the whole house. She calls that one the steam room and the one with the drawer, the sauna. I run into Luke again - he\\u2019s her boyfriend - and he\\u2019s in there. He says to me: \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to move out because you can't live here for free.\\u201d I feel embarrassed, shocked and surprised that he said this because when I first moved here when Lynn offered, she said it was okay to live there and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m there. My job has ended but it was six weeks until I got my payment from it and she said it was okay to pay her rent money at the six week mark when my payments all come in. so, this is why I\\u2019m feeling embarrassed, shocked and surprised. I wonder why she told him that I\\u2019m living there for free and why he thinks he has to be the muscle and tell me instead of her. So, I leave the spa/gym area on the other half of the garage and go into our boxed off area. I tell my son, \\u201cI think we have to leave.\\u201d It\\u2019s the five and a half week mark and only four more days until I\\u2019m supposed to get my money. But I don\\u2019t know where else we can go. This is confusing because I don\\u2019t know if we just stay for four days or if the dream speeds ahead for four days and we stay there. My money does come in when it\\u2019s supposed to. It\\u2019s like the money came in an envelope or maybe I went to a bank. I have the money and I\\u2019m sorting it out on the floor where I was sleeping. I have a little sleeping bag there. I\\u2019m putting the money in piles and saying: \\u201cThis is for that debt and this is for that debt.\\u201d Then I count out Lynn\\u2019s money. I go into the house and she\\u2019s in the kitchen sitting at the table with Luke. I glare at him and then put the money in front of her and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s your six weeks of rent just like we agreed.\\u201d I don\\u2019t stay and talk to her. I turn around and leave the kitchen. My son and I are packing up our stuff. I don\\u2019t know where we are going but we\\u2019re just not staying there because of how that situation was construed to feel horrible instead of something helpful.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Spare Room\\u201d This dream is situated in the house that I lied in with my daughter, only it\\u2019s empty and I\\u2019m the age I am now. I\\u2019m moving into it with two girlfriends that I currently work with at the yoga studio. It\\u2019s move-in day but we don\\u2019t have any furniture, so we\\u2019re doing a walk-through. We look through the main floor. It looks clean. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one for everyone. The bathroom looks like it\\u2019s in good shape. They stay up on the top floor. They\\u2019re looking around in the bedrooms for some specific measurements or something. I go down into the basement. Although the basement looks clean and dry, there\\u2019s something creepy in it; it\\u2019s an energy that I feel. I walk over to the sliding patio glass doors. I look behind the blinds. I see an old man there. He\\u2019s gardening. I ask him if he needs anything. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m good thanks.\\u201d He\\u2019s in the backyard on the other side of the glass and I\\u2019m on the inside. I look down to see what he\\u2019s doing. He has a toolbox and he\\u2019s fixing something. I ask him if he\\u2019s going to need to come into the house. He replies in a voice like, \\u201cOh no no, I would never go in there.\\u201d I think he knows something about this creepy energy in the basement. Then I go back upstairs to the main floor. The other two girls are starting to bring in boxes and furniture. I\\u2019m helping with that, bringing in my own stuff. We each set up our bedrooms then go downstairs. They\\u2019re having trouble arranging the furniture in the living room. A couple pieces are mine, a couple pieces belong to each one of them and we\\u2019re just trying to group them together. I look at what they have and say, \\u201cHmm, it\\u2019s funny that this won\\u2019t fit because when I used to live here, I had the same pieces of furniture and they all fit just fine.\\u201d So we keep rearranging and put the couch on another wall and arranging the other stuff around it. We try this on three different walls when I say, \\u201cWait a minute, I know why this isn\\u2019t fitting! That one wall that goes from the main hallway downstairs to the stairs that go up is shorter than it used to be! What\\u2019s going on with that?\\u201d So I open the door to the closet. Now there\\u2019s a closet on that same wall. For some reason we haven\\u2019t put anything in it, nor did we open it when we did our inspection. I open it up and it\\u2019s giant. Then I close it again and look on the outside of the wall and say, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s why nothing will fit there! Somebody has removed part of the wall in order to make this closet twice as large.\\u201d Then we open the closet door again and this time there is a single bed, a dresser, and a couple of low tables in there. There\\u2019s a light from the ceiling. I say, \\u201cI wonder if they had this set up as an Airbnb room?\\u201d One of the other girls says, \\u201cOr maybe they just needed an extra bedroom?\\u201d Then we close the closet door again. I notice that there is a clothing bar running down the length of the ceiling. I think I say out loud, \\u201cI wonder where we can put our coats?\\u201d Then between the three of us we decide that since we only each have one coat, we can find room for it in our own closets upstairs. Then I open the closet door one more time because I want to check the workmanship to see if this has been a hack job or if it will stay as another bedroom. I\\u2019m kind of entertaining the idea of an Airbnb room in mind. But this time when I open it up there\\u2019s a little tiny crib along with the single bed and dresser. I\\u2019m wondering what happened to this person or the baby. It kind of looks like they still live here. Then I\\u2019m starting to wonder if there\\u2019s a connection between that and the presence in the basement that I feel. I\\u2019m still thinking about this as I go back upstairs to unpack more things in the bedroom. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cDestruction of Kittens\\u201d The snippets of the dream I remember of last night are of being outside. I\\u2019m an observer. I\\u2019m watching leopards, I think, stalking each other and just generally exist in the undergrowth of the forest floor, like a rain forest. There are vines growing between trees and a lot of colors of underbrush. It\\u2019s quite lush. There are blooms, as well. The trees are tall and thin. I can see these large cats stalking each other in the shadows of the trees and pouncing playfully as cats do. Then I look from straight ahead to the left, so my head is turned about ninety degrees of what it just was. I see in the undergrowth a nest of kittens, really young, the kind that aren\\u2019t up and running yet, but folded in upon each other and sleeping as a unit. There are four of them. I\\u2019m aware that the mama is closeby but she\\u2019s stalking something. I just watch them sleeping. You can see the belly breaths, the way all babies do when they sleep breathe. I\\u2019ve missed a snippet. The next thing I notice is this long vine that\\u2019s being whipped back and forth so it\\u2019s really tight. It\\u2019s without discretion cutting everything it comes in contact with as it whips back and forth. It crosses over the nest of kittens and they are destroyed, splattered all over the area.\"],[\"\\u201cRe-living the Move\\u201d I\\u2019m re-living what I\\u2019ve been doing this last week, which is helping my daughter move from a big house into a tiny apartment. I\\u2019m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m in the kitchen and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m up in the attic and there\\u2019s stuff there. There\\u2019s a whole other apartment\\u2019s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she\\u2019s ever had since she was a kid and it\\u2019s all just everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess and it\\u2019s not sorted. She hasn\\u2019t packed any of it into boxes and she\\u2019s asking me to help her, but she\\u2019s not ready. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I\\u2019m in the attic and my friend is there. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s helping, she\\u2019s just sitting there and she\\u2019s talking. Her mood is light and she\\u2019s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They\\u2019re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They\\u2019re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I\\u2019m reaching in and at first I\\u2019m pulling out things that are just garbage and I\\u2019m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn\\u2019t belong with the toys. My friend says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and she says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let\\u2019s do it!\\u201d She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn\\u2019t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don\\u2019t really want to do this because I won\\u2019t be present for what I\\u2019m packing. Then I realize that maybe that\\u2019s silly because I\\u2019m just packing and maybe I don\\u2019t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn\\u2019t really affect me. It actually tastes like water, so that\\u2019s kind of strange.\"],[\"\\u201cBoard Games and Cereal\\u201d I\\u2019m leaving my house with a board game. It\\u2019s resting against my hip and I\\u2019ve got my left hand around the box to keep it closed. I\\u2019m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It\\u2019s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn\\u2019t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven\\u2019t fallen out. It\\u2019s old and the box doesn\\u2019t hold it\\u2019s shape very well because it\\u2019s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I\\u2019m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There\\u2019s somebody else but I can\\u2019t remember who it is now. We don\\u2019t have any front steps and it\\u2019s like a ramp. It actually feels like I\\u2019ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a long line of stores. We\\u2019re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there\\u2019s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there\\u2019s somebody else I know. They\\u2019re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don\\u2019t have masks on either. I note this and say, \\u201cWell, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!\\u201d We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I\\u2019m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, \\u201cThe cash register is over there and you have to line up.\\u201d Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they\\u2019re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They\\u2019re giving me cash. It\\u2019s not debit. I\\u2019m questioning this. The store owner comes back having finished organizing what she wanted to organize. She says, \\u201cThank you so much, I can take it from here.\\u201d I pick up my board game again. I see Julie, who I used to work with at the restaurant. I realize I\\u2019m wearing a hat, glasses and a mask and she\\u2019s probably not going to recognize me. She\\u2019s talking to somebody else I know who calls me over into the conversation. I say, \\u201cDo you know who I am?\\u201d She\\u2019s looking like she might. I take my hat off first and then I just take one of the loops of the mask from my ear quickly. She says my name and I put the mask and hat back on. She gives me a big hug and says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen you in so long.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019ve aged. You look fantastic.\\u201d I wait. She tells me about her life. This goes on for a little bit. I wonder if she\\u2019s going to tell me about her three boys. She tells me she\\u2019s in a new relationship. We say goodbye and she leaves. I notice that a piece from the board game, a house, is moving. It\\u2019s escaped from the box and is flying around. I shout this: \\u201cOh no! The house piece is on the move!\\u201d My kids are trying to catch it. They crawl underneath a cart that shopkeepers put out on the sidewalk for the day - it has legs and a bin and is made of wire. They\\u2019re crawling under these and one of them catches the piece and puts it back in the box. I\\u2019m feeling like we\\u2019ve been gone from the house too long. We turn around and start to make our way back home. I see somebody else on the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a stand up display that a man is hiding behind. He\\u2019s peeking to the person standing on the sidewalk. The person on the sidewalk is describing to us a little fearfully that somebody is spying on them. I don\\u2019t understand why they\\u2019re scared because it\\u2019s just somebody looking at them through a natural gap between the displays. I approach the guy that\\u2019s been accused of spying and say, \\u201cHey, how are you?\\u201d He says he\\u2019s good and he says, \\u201cLook. I can see the entire street through this little tiny gap.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s amazing.\\u201d He\\u2019s got pajamas over his clothes, but just the legs of pajamas. He\\u2019s wearing them like chaps, only they don\\u2019t have a belt. I say, \\u201cThis is interesting, what you have on your legs. May I ask what the purpose of it is?\\u201d He tells me it\\u2019s just a creative idea he had for dressing and he just likes it that way. It\\u2019s not for protection or anything like that. I say, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s very interesting.\\u201d Now the other person who was freaking out and accusing him of spying has been deflated and has stopped having a fit about it. The person that was accused, he was walking around and describing how he made these pajama bottom legs. He\\u2019s not peeking through the thing anymore. I guess that\\u2019s why the other person is okay now. Pajama-bottoms guy walks the opposite way and the other person continues across the street. Then I notice that the pieces of the board game are moving, they\\u2019re vibrating a lot. I\\u2019m saying to my kids, \\u201cWe really have to get home now or we\\u2019re going to lose control of these things and they\\u2019re going to fly out all over the place.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying that, the house piece flies out again. It goes way underneath this great big long outdoor bin of a different store. It goes far enough underneath that there are cobwebs. I\\u2019m not fantastically excited about chasing it under here but I do because the game is useless without that piece. I saw it go under there but it\\u2019s really dark. I feel around with my hand and there\\u2019s only one thing that\\u2019s not first so I grab it. It doesn\\u2019t look like the house piece anymore - it\\u2019s flat and not moving. I go back under there again to check around for anything else and there\\u2019s not. I put the piece in the box and am feeling like it\\u2019s not the piece. I\\u2019m already wondering where we\\u2019re going to get another one of those pieces. I know that we can\\u2019t. We continue on towards the house. There\\u2019s a guy I dated for a little while lingering around the outside. He\\u2019s trying to engage with my family. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t talk to him. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near us.\\u201d I don\\u2019t speak to him. He\\u2019s acting like I did. He\\u2019s smiling and being oblivious. He\\u2019s walking with my family. I\\u2019m getting really annoyed because he\\u2019s dense and acting like someone welcomed him in when nobody did. He follows us up the ramp and now he\\u2019s in the house. I\\u2019m ignoring him. He\\u2019s at my back. I set the board game down on the table. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says, \\u201cHere, if you put this on, it will take away all the pain from your neck, shoulders and back.\\u201d I look down and at first it looks like the thing a catcher wears in a baseball game. It\\u2019s made of this dark blue rough cotton stuff, like something a priestess would wear. It\\u2019s over my clothes. He\\u2019s pulling the drawstrings at the back tightly - they\\u2019re laces - the way someone would lace up the back of a corset. It\\u2019s very constricting and makes my arms stick out awkwardly by my side. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t want this. Can you please just get out of the house? You don\\u2019t live here. This is not your place.\\u201d He lies down on the couch and goes to sleep. I\\u2019m poking at him and he won\\u2019t move. I don\\u2019t know how to deal with this. I\\u2019m looking for my daughter to ask her if she can take these laces off and get me out of this thing. I go upstairs and there\\u2019s been a whole pile of people up there with a whole bunch of kids. They\\u2019ve gotten into everything. They\\u2019ve pulled it all out. I get the vacuum out and start vacuuming things up. You know when there\\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff in the rug and you can hear it clicking as it goes up the vacuum tube? I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019ll have to clean all this up with my hands. I start doing this. I realize there\\u2019s more furniture than will fit in the rooms and there\\u2019s stuff all over the floor. I\\u2019m trying to sort it out and figure out what goes in what room and what we really need. We need something to put towels in and there\\u2019s nothing in the bathroom and no cabinet. Where are we going to put all the towels? I go into my room. There\\u2019s stuff all over the floor! There\\u2019s this three year old kid and I don\\u2019t know who she belongs to. She\\u2019s dumped everything out onto the carpet. I pick it up and put it in bags. I think I\\u2019ve got as much as i can with my hands and start to run the vacuum. When I lift up the bedskirt to vacuum under the bed, the vacuum won\\u2019t go any further. I bend down and look. There are bags of oatmeal cereal that have been poured out and dumped. The oatmeal is eight inches thick. It\\u2019s all underneath the bed. My daughter comes in and knows I\\u2019m upset. She says, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cCan you please just keep picking this stuff up off the floor? Look, the vacuum isn\\u2019t even getting it all out.\\u201d Somebody has taken this black soil from a plant and it\\u2019s slightly wet so even when the vacuum goes over, it leaves a black stain everywhere. I\\u2019m overwhelmed with all the stuff that isn\\u2019t useful and is not in place and the people who aren\\u2019t listening to me and are in my house.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Studio\\u201d I\\u2019m at the studio where I teach. It\\u2019s set up differently, though. The front of the building extends way out into the street and instead of just having a glass front, three of the sides are glass so it\\u2019s a lot more transparent and visible to people walking by. Before it always felt like a sanctuary with natural brick walls and the glass front and wood floors. In this dream it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. I\\u2019m standing at the front desk which is a lot bigger. One of the owners is there. The back hallway that normally leads into the studio is now a back entrance, so people are coming in the back entrance as well. There\\u2019s more than one studio now with two doors. I see my ex-husband and a bunch of his high school friends. They\\u2019re walking like a clump of high school age guys, pushing each other playfully and stuff like that. They walk in without checking in at the desk because they\\u2019re all self-absorbed. They just go down the hall into the studio. The owner is trying to piece together their names and check off their memberships for them. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh great, they\\u2019re going to be in my class that I\\u2019m about to teach in a half hour.\\u201d I\\u2019m mentally rearranging my sequence so I can make it more physical because guys that age need that in order to focus and be present. So I\\u2019m just standing there in my head for a few minutes. Then a bunch of people come in through the back behind me. They\\u2019re also really loud. I don\\u2019t get to finish processing how I\\u2019m going to change my class in my head. They\\u2019re asking questions about the kids class. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cKids class? We don\\u2019t have kids yoga.\\u201d My answer surprised them a little. They're talking amongst themselves. I look at the time and see that it\\u2019s time for me to teach my class. I go across to the hall and am starting my music. I go into the door and instead of a whole bunch of people lying on their mats, there\\u2019s a teacher from the jujitsu studio standing at the front and a whole bunch of eight year olds. I notice the room is really hot not because it\\u2019s a hot class but because there\\u2019s been so much body heat in there working really hard. It hits me like a wall when I open the door. I go back to the desk and say to the owner: \\u201cDo we have kids yoga?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t reply. She\\u2019s already engaging with the group that had come in from the back and discussing the kids yoga with them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, hmm, I guess they do.\\u201d Then I wait for her to finish her conversation with them. I say, \\u201cI don't know where my class is. The room is full of other people and kids.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh they\\u2019re supposed to have finished five minutes ago.\\u201d I go back to the door and this time they see me because I\\u2019m standing with the door open. The teacher says, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll just be five more minutes.\\u201d I open the door fully and turn to look at the back of the room. I see my whole class practically sitting on top of each other. They don\\u2019t have their mats rolled out. My ex-husband is there with his gang. They\\u2019re all wrestling, piled on top of each other. Now it\\u2019s fifteen minutes past the time I was supposed to teach. I go back out to the desk. I tell the studio owner that it\\u2019s disrespectful to not follow the guidelines when you\\u2019re supposed to start and stop a class. She sighs, kind of dejectedly. Then we start talking about an energy exchange. She says, \\u201cWe both need it. I can give you a hot stone massage and I\\u2019m really in need of a thai massage.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that sounds like a really good idea.\\u201d We don\\u2019t deal with the problem of the room stuffed with people. The dream skips over and we\\u2019re trying to set up one of the rooms in the back hallway for the energy exchange. But as soon as we get into the room, the group of kids yoga is exiting and they\\u2019re all over the place. I realize I have to go into teach and say, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m sorry, I can\\u2019t actually do the energy exchange, I have to go teach.\\u201d I go into teach. The group changed all the playlist around so I\\u2019m trying to figure out where mine is because now it\\u2019s playing hard rock. I do that. I put the quiet song on. I do manage to get everyone onto their mats and I start to teach my class. The dream blips. I don\\u2019t remember teaching the entirety of my class. When I come back out to the desk, the studio owner tells me she can\\u2019t do the energy exchange because she has a baseball game to go to now. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ask you to come all the way in on a Saturday for this.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she\\u2019s being kind of passive aggressive about this because her tone of voice and body language imply that she does want me to come in on a Saturday for this. I think I don't. I say, \\u201cWell is there any other Monday that you would be available? I could come in a little earlier before I teach.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, I have baseball on all of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she obviously knew that when we talked about an energy exchange so she really did mean to exchange on a Saturday. I decline the Saturday and leave the building. I start trudging through the stone and guess I\\u2019m going home. I get part way there and I see my ex-sister-in-law\\u2019s two dogs. I forget their names, they\\u2019re a specialty breed and look kind of like poodles or labradoodles, medium sized-dogs. I see them in the snow. One is more of a carmel color and the other is more white. The carmel color one is having trouble walking through the snow. It\\u2019s stopping and the snow plow hasn\\u2019t come by yet. They think they\\u2019re in a snow bank but they\\u2019re actually in the middle of the road. I pick up the carmel colored one and the white one is still running through. I forget their names so I\\u2019m just calling it, \\u201cCome on! Come on you can do this!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to encourage it to go back over to the sidewalk. I\\u2019m going to walk the dogs home. The one I\\u2019m carrying is kind of heavy and my feet and legs feel heavy because of the snow. I look behind me for one second and then I don\\u2019t see the white one anymore. I look back the way I came and it\\u2019s lying down in the middle of the road. At first I think it\\u2019s dead. I touch it and it responds and it\\u2019s still warm, so it\\u2019s not dead. Now I\\u2019ve got both of the dogs in my arms and am trying to hold them under my arms like two footballs. They\\u2019re obviously sick and not well. I\\u2019m worried that their life is beginning to blink out. I\\u2019m struggling with them as I go down the sidewalk into the Co-op. It\\u2019s funny because she never lived there, but her twin sister did. I get stuck. There\\u2019s a community yard sale going on. I notice where the office used to be is a sign that now says, \\u201cSeneca College.\\u201d It\\u2019s now an office where they are trying to recruit teenagers from the Co-op directly into the college. I think that\\u2019s a pretty good idea. I\\u2019m trying to walk up the sidewalk towards her unit. There\\u2019s another dog and it\\u2019s a whippet - a racing dog with a long pointy nose. It\\u2019s snarling and growling aggressively as if it\\u2019s going to attack the other two dogs. I\\u2019ve got them in my arms and they\\u2019re not responding. They\\u2019re barely breathing. I tell this group of teenagers: \\u201cCan you please go ahead of me so there are people between that dog and these because it\\u2019s going to attack. They oblige. They do and are really nice about it. But we\\u2019re moving really slowly. I finally get to her door and knock on it and say, \\u201cLook who I found.\\u201d She\\u2019s so grateful and I say, \\u201cOh, you live beside where I live!\\u201d Now it\\u2019s twenty years ago and I\\u2019m apparently living in the same unit I lived in when my daughter was little. She gets the dogs back and puts them in a specialty bed she made for them. She\\u2019s a nurse and is looking after them and everything seems to be fine.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sound\\u201d I\\u2019m on my way or coming from somewhere. I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven\\u2019t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We\\u2019re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It\\u2019s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can\\u2019t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they\\u2019re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it\\u2019s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they\\u2019re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn\\u2019t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, \\u201cYes, I know. I don\\u2019t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, are you coming for Trina\\u2019s fiftieth birthday?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t know about that, but maybe.\\u201d She writes the date down and tells me it\\u2019s going to be on April first. When she\\u2019s writing this down I say, \\u201cYou know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn\\u2019t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll put my phone number down here, too.\\u201d She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have yours either.\\u201d She gives me another piece of paper, it\\u2019s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I\\u2019m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it\\u2019s so small that there isn\\u2019t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, \\u201cHmm, there\\u2019s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d While she\\u2019s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I\\u2019m doing this, she says to me, \\u201cHave you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they\\u2019re trying to change things in this town.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow they must really have their work cut out for them because there\\u2019s so much dark horribleness in this place.\\u201d She\\u2019s telling me that there\\u2019s a movement against them coming in. I just say, \\u201cNo, I didn\\u2019t know about either one.\\u201d Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I\\u2019m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I\\u2019m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I\\u2019ve asked her for a drink of water which I\\u2019ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it\\u2019s windy and they\\u2019re blowing open. So I\\u2019m trying to pee as I\\u2019m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it\\u2019s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, \\u201cCome back anytime.\\u201d I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there\\u2019s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way. I just press his phone number to see if he\\u2019s home because I don\\u2019t want to go out there if he isn\\u2019t. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Baby\\u201d I\\u2019m in an arena, the kind where people have hockey games and figure skating competitions. I\\u2019m carrying a baby, maybe about 4-6 months old. I\\u2019m walking around the arena. I see one of the managers from the restaurant where I used to work, Blake. I don\\u2019t approach him yet. I go into one of the change rooms. Nobody is in it. I see one of those dropdown beds that you push into the wall. I drop it down and I lie down on it with my baby and I begin to nurse her. I finish that. She\\u2019s happy and fed. I put her in a sling attached to my body and open the arena door and go out onto the ice. I\\u2019m skating. I skate around and around and around. I\\u2019m enjoying myself. The baby is liking this, too - I can see her smiling face inside her hat and she\\u2019s laughing. A good deal of time passes and I think that\\u2019s enough. We go back and I open the heavy arena door, it\\u2019s kind of hard with a baby in a sling in front of my body. I step down a step and go back to the change room. I stop because Blake comes in the door and tells me that I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that in the arena without something from the drug store, I can\\u2019t remember what. I say, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize that.\\u201d So, I put my coat back on and the baby is still in the sling. We walk out of the arena, down the long ramp, down a few blocks to the drug store. I\\u2019m in the drug store and looking at all these baby products. I think I don\\u2019t need any of these things. I leave the store and go back to the arena. As soon as I arrive, Blake comes back out again and he\\u2019s questioning me. I am trying to tell him that I know what I\\u2019m doing, but he\\u2019s agitated. He follows me into the change room. I want to lie down again and nurse my baby. He\\u2019s telling me I\\u2019m doing a whole bunch of things wrong. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s four pillows on the bed, it will be fine.\\u201d He leaves but he\\u2019s exasperated with me. I nurse my baby again and then she\\u2019s tired so I let her rest. I pile the pillows up around her. Because Blake has made me question myself, I stand there for a moment and think, \\u201cIs there any way that she would be ready to start crawling and get out of these pillows?\\u201d I\\u2019m positive that she\\u2019s not ready. I leave the change room and go out into the arena foyer. Now there\\u2019s a big lineup and it\\u2019s no longer an arena. At the end of the ramp where the door opens is a pier where a ferry backs in so people can drive onto it and go across the lake. While I\\u2019m standing there, I see one of my son\\u2019s friends and his mom and they\\u2019re waiting in the lineup. There are two different lineups about two feet apart. I\\u2019m standing between them. They both have a different agenda. The mom is going one place and her son is going another place. They\\u2019re arguing because the mom is saying one thing but her son is contradicting her saying, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it says in the Bible.\\u201d I wonder when he started being interested in that because he certainly wasn\\u2019t all the years he was friends with my son. I think he deserves to be listened to. I ask him a couple questions about why he\\u2019s making that statement and why he has to go this way. He explains it to me. I think that makes sense and I guess really the only way to find out is if you actually get on the ferry and go to the destination and see if all those white rocks are actually there. I wish him good luck or the best or safe journey or something. I turn to the mom and say, \\u201cI think he\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t talk to me, she just keeps looking straight ahead and she had the whole time she was standing there. I turn around and walk back through the lineups and up the ramp, back to the arena and into the change room where my baby is still sleeping. I decide that I\\u2019m tired and I lay down beside her, put my head on the pillow and go to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cCourt Date\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house I used to live in and it was the top floor of a bungalow and in the basement was a doctor\\u2019s office. I\\u2019m in the back bedroom. I\\u2019m sitting on my bed and I have a laptop in front of me. I\\u2019m also curling my hair, which is extremely strange because I have naturally curly hair and I\\u2019ve never used a curling iron in my life. I take a piece of my hair and I put it between the mouth of the curling iron and I pull the curling iron all the way to the end the way I\\u2019ve seen other people do, which actually straightens my hair, then I wrap the curling iron around my hair and I hold it and then I unwrap it. Instead of my hair being curly, it\\u2019s straight. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m doing this and don\\u2019t understand why I would do this. I have this dream consciousness that is confused and then there\\u2019s another consciousness that is also saying, \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t even work! It doesn\\u2019t even curl my hair the way it\\u2019s supposed to!\\u201d My son is only about eight years old in the dream and he\\u2019s occupying the other back bedroom. I know he\\u2019s there because I can hear him moving around. Since I hear him moving around, I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts on the two documents I\\u2019m writing on my laptop so I don\\u2019t lose my train of thought because I\\u2019m going to do a board game with him or something. I want to see what he wants to do now that he\\u2019s awake. It\\u2019s morning. I have been up for quite a while. He has just woken up and I can hear this because there\\u2019s movement. I look on the laptop and I\\u2019ve got one document open where I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts and focus for an upcoming court case with my son\\u2019s father. The other one is something that I\\u2019m writing as a creative project that I\\u2019m not sure is for school or just enjoyment. I click into the court case one because that one\\u2019s more important and has a date coming up soon. I\\u2019m trying to sort out the threads in my head of how the court date arose, what the reason is for it. It\\u2019s really hard to sort out because I don\\u2019t want to make it into an attack on my son\\u2019s dad\\u2019s character, yet every reason I would put in there that I would say anything about is also going to be something to do with his character. I think this is why it\\u2019s so hard to write. If it wasn\\u2019t for his character, there wouldn\\u2019t be a court case. But he continues to lie and doesn\\u2019t follow through on any of the custody conditions. He just doesn\\u2019t do them then lies and says he was. So I typed five words out then keep deleting them. I close the laptop and get up to leave the room, but the door opens and my son is standing there. I ask him what he would like to do today. He says that he wants to go out to someplace. I get up and we go out into the kitchen to have breakfast first, but his dad is standing there. I\\u2019m confused as to how he got in the house. He\\u2019s in the kitchen and he\\u2019s making a piece of toast or sandwich or something and is carrying it out into the living room. He lies down on the couch and puts the sandwich on his chest and turns the tv on. I feel that this is somehow a violation of not only the custody arrangement but of my own personal space. Then my son goes into the living room and is watching the television, only it\\u2019s guys out on the town and it's really inappropriate for an eight year old boy to be watching. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat kind of arrangement is this?\\u201d I could have sworn he had his own place. I\\u2019m standing there in the kitchen trying to sort that out in my head. I\\u2019m wondering why I don\\u2019t remember this. Then I think of twelve other times recently where he\\u2019s been in the house and I start to doubt myself and think maybe I don\\u2019t have my own space and maybe he does live here and maybe this is what the court case is about because we still have to have personal time with our son. But since he\\u2019s making the sandwich and turning the tv on, it\\u2019s eroding my son\\u2019s attention and he\\u2019s just going over to the tv and now I\\u2019m not getting my own time with my son because of what his dad is doing. I walk back down the hall to the bedroom. I go back to the laptop because I think maybe there\\u2019s a document to help me remember whose day this is supposed to be and what the arrangements are because I didn\\u2019t think he was living with us. As I\\u2019m looking for that, my son comes into the bedroom. I say, \\u201cOh good, you\\u2019re back.\\u201d I close the laptop and think maybe I don\\u2019t have to sort this out. I say, \\u201cWould you like to play a boardgame?\\u201d He says yes. I say, \\u201cGood.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ve got this pinball machine in the closet that would be really interesting to play plus it would be good for his hand eye coordination and I like that it\\u2019s not television, it\\u2019s the opposite, it\\u2019s something you kind of do with your body. I say to him, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just play this for a few minutes. Then we can go out for a walk because it\\u2019s snowing out and it\\u2019s really pretty.\\u201d He says that he would like to do that. I show him how to pull the big plunger back, then watch it hit the ball, then the ball goes up and hits the other lights. I say, \\u201cThen you have to move this way, then you have to move that way because you want the ball to hit the paddle, then you use the flippers to hit it. We\\u2019re trying to get it to go into this part of the tube.\\u201d He does and he tries but he doesn\\u2019t pull the plunger back far enough and he gets discouraged. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay, here try it again, it\\u2019s alright.\\u201d But he only pulls it three times and gets discouraged again and wants to go out and lie on the couch with his dad and watch tv. I feel really defeated by this because that\\u2019s all his dad does. I tell him, \\u201cWell, your dad\\u2019s not supposed to pick you up at four, so let\\u2019s go for a walk, let\\u2019s go outside and walk through the snowflakes.\\u201d But then his dad comes down to the room and opens the bedroom door and bends down and picks him up and takes him back into the living room. Now I feel really resigned. I sit back on the bed, open up the laptop, and from my own memory, I\\u2019m typing out what I remember the custody arrangement to be. Every time I type a sentence, the computer erases it. There\\u2019s something wrong with the computer. Then I think that maybe if I record my voice and do text to talk, that will work, then I\\u2019ll just fix the typos that those things always make after. I'm trying to do that. Then I hear my ex going out the door. I hear the front door shut. I look out and he\\u2019s taken my son and gone. So I go out the front door and think that at least I can go for a walk now. I go out onto the back porch. It\\u2019s a beautiful sunny day. My phone rings. It\\u2019s my friend who lives in Holland now and I haven\\u2019t talked to in years. I tell her, \\u201cOh, hi!\\u201d I\\u2019m excited to hear from her. I notice she has a Dutch accent now and she didn\\u2019t when she lived in Canada and I think that\\u2019s from being in Holland for so long. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m just about to go for a walk, but I\\u2019d really love to talk to you. Can I call you back later?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell I only have time to talk right now.\\u201d I notice as I\\u2019m talking to her that my son is on the stairs at the bottom of the deck. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing there because he was supposed to be with his dad. I tell my friend, \\u201cI actually can\\u2019t talk to you right now because my son is here.\\u201d She sounds really disappointed, but I promise to call her back. I hang the phone up then these two men come walking up the back porch and I realize that they\\u2019re for the doctor who lives in the basement because this happens all the time between the hours of 8-4. It\\u2019s a man and his twelve to fourteen year old son. They\\u2019re walking together and the dad\\u2019s taking him to the doctor\\u2019s office. They\\u2019re about to go in when the man looks at me and says, \\u201cBathe me.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019m not going to do that!\\u201d He pulls up a chair and another for his son. His son sits in one of the chairs. He sits in the chair and crosses his ankle over his thigh and sits back a little bit, then he crosses his hands over his chest. Then he looks at me and says, \\u201cIf you come here I\\u2019ll tell you why that\\u2019s funny.\\u201d His son has a smirk on his face and so does the dad. I think he\\u2019s genuinely trying to tell me a joke. He looks completely harmless and his body movements are such that he\\u2019s still trying to keep the time for his appointment. I think, \\u201cShould I let him just tell his joke?\\u201d I start to walk over in front of him so he can give me the punch line, then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Domo\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to teach my class and there\\u2019s so much noise that I can\\u2019t even hear the sound of my own voice. I\\u2019m not sure what building I\\u2019m in, it\\u2019s got a sloped ceiling but the ceiling is also really high and there\\u2019s a little bit of slope to the floor. It\\u2019s almost like a lecture theatre, except there are no chairs. It\\u2019s supposed to have really good acoustics but it doesn\\u2019t because there\\u2019s so much background noise, but it\\u2019s not the students in the class that are talking, it\\u2019s students in the hallway and crowds of people outside. I can hear construction, jack hammers and buzz saws. It\\u2019s a cacophony of sound and so loud that I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m speaking or not. I can\\u2019t start my class. I go to the hallway, open the doorway and ask the people out there waiting to go into another class if they could please be quiet because they\\u2019re so loud. As I\\u2019m saying this, I realize there\\u2019s not supposed to be any talking in the building. So they say they will be quiet. I go back into my class. As soon as I start teaching, I can hear them again. They\\u2019re playing sports in the hallway, yelling and cheering. I can\\u2019t start. Then I\\u2019m sitting off to the side, I still have to sit there for the full hour, but I\\u2019m not teaching because I can\\u2019t. I see my brother. He\\u2019s not in the class, but he\\u2019s wandered up from the construction sight where people are building something. He\\u2019s taking a break. We talk for a few minutes. I feel really good to see him in my heart, I feel comforted by his presence. Then, it\\u2019s quieter. It stays quiet. I say I\\u2019m going to start trying to teach my class again. I ask him: \\u201cWill you stay?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t practice yoga, but he says, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll try it this time.\\u201d There he is. I move my mat from the middle of the class up to the front as though I\\u2019m a participant. This way I can be beside my brother. My voice, because of the design of the acoustics, it doesn\\u2019t matter that I\\u2019m not facing my class because the voice is supposed to carry anyways. So I start teaching and it\\u2019s so nice and quiet. I get through the sun salutations and a few other postures, then all the horrible noises start again. I try to teach a little bit more but I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I do a few more things just continuing on, hoping the class can see me and just follow along. This works for about five minutes, then the whole cohesiveness disintegrates so I stop. By this time the hour I was supposed to be in there was over and I\\u2019m free to go. I ask my brother, \\u201cEven though it was only a part class, what do you think? You looked like you were doing everything just fine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, you know it is a good class. But I\\u2019m not going to start doing it every day.\\u201d I laugh because I know he wouldn\\u2019t do that anyway. He goes back to the construction area and I go out the opposite door of where the students are going into the noisy hallway. I exit out of the building but it\\u2019s not really a hallway, everything turns into glass. There\\u2019s a glass vestibule and a door to the outside which is a docked area with a walkway and piers but I don\\u2019t see any ships. It\\u2019s good to be out in the sunlight and air. I see the husband and two kids of the two studio owners I work for. I walk towards them. I\\u2019m supposed to meet them because we\\u2019re all waiting for her. While we\\u2019re waiting, one of her kids is squatting down on the dock and looking into a hole in it. I\\u2019m curious at what they\\u2019re doing, they\\u2019re trying to pull out a bug. I walk over closer and actually see that he\\u2019s pulled out one already and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I wonder what kind of bug it is. I squat down closer to see and I\\u2019m just watching, I haven\\u2019t said anything to him. He has some kind of tweezers and is trying to pull out another bug and he\\u2019s working away at it for a few minutes. Then he says to me, \\u201cCan you see it down there?\\u201d I get a flashlight out from the back of my cell phone and am shining it around in the hole. I can see something but I don\\u2019t know what it is. Then he says to me, \\u201cHere,\\u201d and he hands me the tweezers. \\u201cCan you try?\\u201d So I get down a little closer on my belly. I can see something down there now. I want to be careful I don\\u2019t injure it. I put the tweezers around it gently and start to pull a little bit. Then I take it out. I have it just behind it\\u2019s skull, around its neck. I set it on the dock. It\\u2019s just sitting there, kind of like it\\u2019s stunned, probably because of the light. It was quite dark down in the hole. It\\u2019s got a very very very dark green body and a gold head. It has a band of gold at the top of its tail and the rest of its tail is green, a greenish black. I say, \\u201cOh what is this?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t have scales, it has the body of a beetle, but without the hard shell on the top so it\\u2019s soft. It\\u2019s tail is reptilian. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a domo.\\u201d I say, \\u201dHmm, I\\u2019ve never heard of that.\\u201d We look at it a little bit more. It has really beautiful black eyes and it looks like there\\u2019s a soul in them. Probably it\\u2019s three inches long. I say, \\u201cOkay?\\u201d He says yes. Then I put it back in the hole. The other things that he\\u2019s pulled out look like dead bugs, probably that the domo has fed from. I just use the side of my hand to brush them back into the hole. I give the son back his tweezers. We stand up. The daughter says something to me but I can\\u2019t recall now what it was. We move off to the side away from the dock. We\\u2019re still waiting for their mom to come. We sit. I don\\u2019t know how we got inside the building but we are. We\\u2019re in a different part of the building. The kids are playing together and I\\u2019m sitting down. The husband comes over and starts talking to me about something. Then he says, \\u201cJust a sec, close your eyes.\\u201d As soon as I close my eyes, I feel this big particle start to fall on my eye and face. He blows on my face. I feel it move along my eyelashes. Then he says, \\u201cOh are you upset that I did that?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking it was a little bit weird having his breath so close to my face. I don't think he meant anything intimate by it. I think he was just having a dad reflex, like when you say hold still and blow to interrupt a thing that was going to fall in your kid\\u2019s eyes. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But then I look at the thing and it\\u2019s like a big giant salt crystal, probably a quarter inch by quarter inch like a triangle cube. Now they\\u2019re falling all over the place. There\\u2019s a bed that\\u2019s not mine and somebody is supposed to be lying in it. These salt crystals are all over it. I look and there is a handheld vacuum off to the side. I say, \\u201cHey I\\u2019m going to use this and see if I can get these things off the bed before they fall all the way down to the bottom.\\u201d I turn the vacuum on and suck up these things. But there are so many of them that they are spilling out of the vacuum as quickly as they\\u2019re coming in. I dump these things out of the vacuum. I open the vacuum up, clean it all out, put the vacuum together and turn it on. I put my hand over the nozzle and feel that it has good suction. I go back to the bed and try to suck these into the vacuum. I pull the mattress away from the side of the bed so I can get in there. I do this a few times. Now I realize that I do need to sleep here. I don\\u2019t want to lie on these hard crystalline things. I\\u2019m trying to get them off the bed. I\\u2019m fiddling with this and trying to clean it. Then I see that the studio owner, the kids\\u2019 mom, is back. Something completes. I don\\u2019t have to wait anymore. I\\u2019ve done what I\\u2019m supposed to do and can check out now.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Songwriter\\u201d I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It\\u2019s like a small theatre, so it\\u2019s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they\\u2019re hosting a band. I don\\u2019t sit at one of the seats though, I\\u2019m standing at the back. I\\u2019m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I\\u2019m listening to the lyrics because I\\u2019m familiar with them. I\\u2019m really just wanting to enjoy how they\\u2019re paired with the melody. We\\u2019re about four songs in. He sings this one and it\\u2019s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I\\u2019m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn\\u2019t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight\\u2019s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I\\u2019m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he\\u2019s finished and, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to tell you about that song.\\u201d I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It\\u2019s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It\\u2019s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, \\u201cOh, where did this come from?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI found it in your friend\\u2019s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he\\u2019s dead.\\u201d It\\u2019s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn\\u2019t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn\\u2019t really grieved his friend\\u2019s death. That\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It\\u2019s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, \\u201cNo way, he wouldn\\u2019t have written this for me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.\\u201d I can see it\\u2019s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I\\u2019m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It\\u2019s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d How could there be any other result here other than he\\u2019s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?\\u201d He\\u2019s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he\\u2019s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, \\u201cThank you for showing me this.\\u201d We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Protective Glasses\\u201d I go back to the same theatre. This time I\\u2019m with my daughter. We\\u2019re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I\\u2019m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There\\u2019s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There\\u2019s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they\\u2019re closing them and stuff, but we\\u2019re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we\\u2019re standing there and we\\u2019re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don\\u2019t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: \\u201cWhat are those glasses you\\u2019re wearing? Are they protective somehow?\\u201d She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHmm, wow, maybe they do work,\\u201d kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there\\u2019s an indoor pool. It\\u2019s the same thing where we\\u2019re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you\\u2019re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it\\u2019s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they\\u2019re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don\\u2019t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can\\u2019t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher\\u2019s attention and say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s in there, she\\u2019s in the pool.\\u201d I go back outside so I\\u2019m behind the glass and I\\u2019m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I\\u2019m scanning the water, there\\u2019s no daughter. I\\u2019m starting to get scared and thinking, \\u201cAre they so busy testing everyone that they\\u2019re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?\\u201d I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to be in here! You can\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for my daughter! She\\u2019s underneath the water. She\\u2019s not surfacing.\\u201d They look and she\\u2019s not in there. Now I\\u2019m really scared, like, \\u201cWhat the heck? Where is she?\\u201d The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She\\u2019s definitely not in the pool. We\\u2019re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I\\u2019m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She\\u2019s coming from the back of the pool. They\\u2019re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?\\u201d She says, \\u201c Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.\\u201d I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I\\u2019m upset with her.\"],[\"\\u201cChalk Paint\\u201d I\\u2019m in a car and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are really slushy. You can feel it underneath the wheels of the car when the slush is so thick and heavy that it kind of pulls the car in the direction you\\u2019re not steering, so it\\u2019s a real struggle to let it go straight. I pull into a parallel parking space at the side of the street that looks very much like a street I recognize, which is supposedly the widest main street in Canada. I get out of the car and I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk looking up. It\\u2019s an old railway town. The stores are made of the red clay brick and they go straight up because they\\u2019re tall and skinny and probably have three levels to the stores because they have to plus an attic full of old junk. I\\u2019m reading the names of the stores because I need some chalk paint. None look like they\\u2019re likely to have chalk paint, although one looks like a little bit of a possibility. I\\u2019m just about to walk over to it when I see someone I know from the old yoga studio I used to work at. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing standing there. I tell her I\\u2019m looking for chalk paint. I realize as I\\u2019m saying that she actually lives here. I add, \\u201cDo you know any place that would have some?\\u201d I briefly describe the project I\\u2019m doing and I tell her the look I want it to have because I don\\u2019t want just plain white chalk paint or anything like that. I want seafoam green and a chalky turquoise. She says, \\u201cYes, I know the perfect place. It\\u2019s one block down that way and it\\u2019s called Moody\\u2019s.\\u201d I thank her and walk towards the direction she indicated. I\\u2019m standing in front of the store now and I have my son with me. He\\u2019s about ten in this dream. It doesn\\u2019t look like a place that would have chalk paint, although she said that it does and she goes there all the time and their selection is fantastic and she spent a few sentences endorsing it. So undaunted, I go in anyway. There are kids all in the front of the store and they\\u2019re unsupervised kids probably between the ages of six and eight, maybe nine. They\\u2019re throwing toys up in the air and boys are engaged in a cooperative game of something they just invented. There are a few younger kids just staying back out of the danger zone. I think this can\\u2019t be the right place so I go out of the store, read the sign and see that it\\u2019s spelled the same way, and so I re-enter. Now I\\u2019m looking for someone who is running the store. I see an elderly man and it kind of looks like he\\u2019s wearing a paint smock, so I make a bee-line for him. I ask him if he has chalk paint. He says, \\u201cYes, I do. There\\u2019s a selection right over there,\\u201d and he points. I think, \\u201cHow could I have missed this?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking and there\\u2019s a little shelf, probably about five feet tall by about two feet wide by about ten inches deep. It has three boxes in it that look like there might have been a small canister of paint in them at one point, but they\\u2019re all opened. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s why I missed it because it also has a ramshackle assortment of kids toys on it. However, I walk the way he indicated thinking that maybe there\\u2019s something more here than what I\\u2019m seeing. But no. There\\u2019s one small pint of paint in one of the boxes and the other boxes, you can tell there used to be paint in them but they only have the accessories that would have come with the paint. Miraculously, the one little pint of paint is an antique white. I think, \\u201cWell this might work.\\u201d But I still need the other colors. I\\u2019m not really finished. I walk over to the counter with the paint and there\\u2019s a lineup of parents in front of me all asking him questions about their kids. My son is not in the room anymore, but he\\u2019s ten and I\\u2019m not worried. I think he must have found something to do while I\\u2019m doing this. I wander into the back room and there are more kids playing cooperative games. There\\u2019s a shelf full of kids blocks and he\\u2019s over there and helping some younger kids build something big out of blocks. We make eye contact and I shake my head like, \\u201cNo we\\u2019re not ready to go yet.\\u201d But now I know where he is so I walk back out of that room and stand in the lineup of parents at the counter. When it\\u2019s my turn, I say, \\u201cIs this all the apint you have?\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering why would my friend tell me that this guy has a fantastic selection and it\\u2019s excellent. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019ve got a few more boxes behind the counter.\\u201d I look and they\\u2019re identical to the open ones that had been on the shelf and they\\u2019re also open. As he pulls one out I notice that the paint is not the color that it said on the box. I feel an internal eye roll happening in my own body. I think this is going to take forever. Instead I describe the two colors that I want: \\u201cI want a chalky turquoise and a chalky seafoam green.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell I have this one called mint green.\\u201d I look at it and it\\u2019s far too candy-like. It looks like a wedding reception mint. I say, \\u201cNo. That's got too much blue in it.\\u201d Then he pulls out another one and says, \\u201cHow about this?\\u201d It\\u2019s an obvious blue. I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, that\\u2019s too dark.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cHere, well I have these samples.\\u201d It\\u2019s a board that has a fingerprint of paint colors on it with the paint colors underneath. I think we\\u2019re making progress. I actually find the two colors I want and say, \\u201cYes! It\\u2019s these two. Do you have these?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust a minute.\\u201d He rummages underneath the counter. He\\u2019s gone and it\\u2019s like there are stairs leading down to the basement. He\\u2019s gone for about half an hour. I leave the room I\\u2019m standing in because I\\u2019m in danger of being pinged on the head by some flying toy. I go into the other room where my son is and I just sit there and watch the kids playing. About half an hour rolls by and then the man waves at me from the doorway and gives me the thumbs up. I tell my son it\\u2019s time to go. I go back to the counter and sure enough he has the two colors of paint. I pay him and we leave.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Warpath\\u201d I\\u2019m living with a group of people outside on the plains, like a meadow but the earth is soft. We live and sleep outside. We\\u2019re on the way somewhere, we\\u2019re traveling. We\\u2019re tired and we need to stop and rest. We have adults as well as elderly people and some young kids in our group as well. I\\u2019d say when the dream starts there are probably about one hundred of us. We gather flower tops and berries and roots as well as small animals and that\\u2019s our food. I don\\u2019t get the small animals, but somebody does. We sleep on the grass, too. We\\u2019ve got wool blankets that we wrap ourselves in. There\\u2019s a group of indigenous people and the first time we come into contact with them, they have deep reddish brown horses that they\\u2019re riding. They just come in and they sweep through and it\\u2019s so quick and so violent that we\\u2019re in shock, we\\u2019re stunned, we don\\u2019t even react. Some of us just run and others are caught up by them or killed instantly. A couple of the women are carried off. We don\\u2019t know where to go to hide from them because there\\u2019s just more of this wide open plains area. So what we do instead is we\\u2019ve got these iron spikes, they\\u2019re like pegs that are about nine inches long. The next day we drive them into the ground around the outskirts of where we are so that the next time they come, they ones on foot will step on these and so will their horses and hopefully that will deter them from the mad sweep that they do really fast - they won\\u2019t be able to do that and that will give us a little bit more time to get away. All day long we spend driving these stakes into the ground so they stick up about six inches from the ground and about six feet apart, but they won\\u2019t be able to see them because they came at dusk last time and we know they\\u2019re going to do that again, probably at dusk. That night when we sit down to eat they don\\u2019t come, nothing happens. We eat, we sleep, we wake up again. A few nights pass like this. We\\u2019re pretty sure they\\u2019re going to come back. But during that period of time while we\\u2019re waiting, I have a few conversations with some of the kids, like the almost pubescent boys. There\\u2019s a group of three or four of them that sit there sullenly the way teenagers can be though they\\u2019re not yet teeangers. One of them in particular doesn\\u2019t like how the adults in the group are handling this at all. He\\u2019s becoming bitter and angry. I\\u2019m asking him how he thinks things should be done differently. He says that we should just get out of there. I say, \\u201cOkay, where would you have us go?\\u201d Then he doesn\\u2019t answer. There\\u2019s another one who is upset by his attitude and when I leave the conversation they get into a fist fight. Me and a few of the others go in and break it up. We know we need to do something differently and there\\u2019s that generally consensus starting to thread its way through our group. Now there\\u2019s not a hundred of us anymore, there\\u2019s about seventy because thirty were killed or taken the last time there was a raid. It\\u2019s that night that as soon as we finish eating, it\\u2019s just dusk when things are grey, when the natives come through again. They\\u2019re slowed down a little bit by the spikes but they quickly figure out they can go around them. More people do manage to get away and they only pick off about twenty this time. But this reduces us to fifty. The next day some of the men say they\\u2019re going to scout to see if there\\u2019s any other place we can go. They go into the forest. The forest is really thick and this is the issue. Do we keep moving forward on the plains or do we risk what\\u2019s in the forest? So that\\u2019s where a couple of men go to see if we can shelter there. But we also want to keep moving and we don\\u2019t want to just sit there hiding in fear which is where we might get stuck if we go into the forest. We\\u2019re thinking about what else we can do to defend ourselves from these raids. There\\u2019s also the elderly people who really aren\\u2019t capable of moving much farther at this point. We continue spending our days driving these iron spikes into the earth, trying to spread them around so we have a complete circle around us. That night when the men come back they say they\\u2019ve got good news and bad news. They tell us that they think there\\u2019s a different way of life moving forward from here, but we\\u2019ll have to change how we relate to each other as a group. One of them says, \\u201cEach woman has to pair up with a man and stay with him forever. The one man will be responsible for the survival of the one woman.\\u201d I think this is ridiculous. What\\u2019s going to happen to all these elderly people? There are no men for the elderly women, so who\\u2019s going to speak for them? I\\u2019m also disgusted and thinking, \\u201cEw there\\u2019s not one of you in this group that I want to stay with forever.\\u201d I\\u2019m suspicious about where this idea came from. The two of them maybe cooked this up together when they went into the forest and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a solution and won\\u2019t help the group survive as a group, it will just pick certain people out of it and leave the other ones to die. It really upsets me. That night the natives come through one more time. Only this time they only carry off one of the women. We\\u2019re sitting at a group of about forty-five people left. I\\u2019m avoiding picking any one of the men tonight. In fact, I\\u2019ve decided to stand up for the elderly and I will feed them at my table and give them seats there. The teeangers, the younger boys that I talked to the other night, also seem to agree with me and they moved their sleeping mats to where I\\u2019m sleeping with these eldelry people.\"],[\"\\u201cWheat\\u201d I\\u2019m eating supper with my friend who is a dietician and her family. She has four kids and her husband is there, too. She\\u2019s describing to me the benefits of a plant based diet and invites me to stay for supper. I agree because I think it\\u2019s going to be all plant based food, but instead, she dishes out pasta like spaghetti that already has tomato sauce mixed in with it, and starts putting it on everybody\\u2019s plates. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you, I can\\u2019t eat wheat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, hmm, that\\u2019s all we have.\\u201d I say,\\u201dThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m used to not eating anything as opposed to eating wheat and suffering through the effects of it for weeks to come.\\u201d When her family is finished eating I notice that hardly any of her kids ate all the pasta. She just scrapes it all into the garbage. I wonder why she\\u2019s feeding her family stuff like this when she\\u2019s been advocating this plant based diet and also creating such waste. I find this puzzling.\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on a path outside. It feels like I\\u2019m in Canada with meadows and a coniferous forest. I see a snake. It\\u2019s sunning itself and they\\u2019re usually a bit preoccupied when they\\u2019re doing that so I\\u2019m not alarmed and I\\u2019m just watching it. It\\u2019s a big snake, it looks like a boa but it\\u2019s not six feet long, it\\u2019s [probably about four feet long. Maybe it\\u2019s a baby boa. It\\u2019s about three inches thick through the middle. It has a really attractive assortment of markings, pretty intricate with a lot of colors. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m just standing there looking at it, I\\u2019m admiring it. All of a sudden it springs, it recoils, and it shoots itself maybe three or two feet away from me. It does this so quickly that I scream. As I\\u2019m screaming I see that it saw a rat and it just shot itself over to the rat. But I screamed so loud that I actually woke myself up. My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to go back to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m now in a place outside with snakes. Now I\\u2019m a little bit nervous in my dream. There are different colors and sizes of them and they\\u2019re all on the ground where I am. I\\u2019m trying to tippy toe around them. I\\u2019m not in the same place I was in the first dream. This place has a tropical lush feel. I\\u2019m trying to pick my way through the snakes. I\\u2019m scared and really want to run but I\\u2019m afraid quick movements will disturb the snakes. So I\\u2019m walking very slowly and carefully, tip-toeing. I make it through the forest without being attacked by snakes. I come out in someone\\u2019s backyard or a recreational area with an in-ground pool. I see some people I know - the Jones family. I know the mom and one of her sons. The mom sees me and waves me over. I go and sit with her as she indicates - in front of her. We\\u2019re sitting in outdoor lawn furniture and there\\u2019s an umbrella over our heads. She\\u2019s talking because this is her family reunion. She\\u2019s describing the relationships she has with everyone. She\\u2019s animated and enjoying this conversation. I certainly don\\u2019t mind listening to her describe her connections and her joy with her family. Then she asks me if I want to swim. I happen to be wearing a bathing suit underneath my dress and tell her, \\u201cYeah, that would be great.\\u201d I get in the pool. I\\u2019m swimming around, just enjoying the water. There are a lot of other people in the pool. At one point I lean back against the edge of the pool and put my elbows on it and lean my head back a little, letting the rest of my body float up near the surface. I\\u2019m just lightly moving my feet to keep my lower body afloat. My mind kind of drifts away. I\\u2019m aware of other people there but I\\u2019m just enjoying the sun. There\\u2019s an intense blue sky above me. I\\u2019m in the water and it\\u2019s just nice. But then the laughing gets closer and becomes more sporadic so it disturbs my reverie. I open my eyes and let my feet float down towards the bottom of the pool. I notice that one guy is standing at the edge of the pool and he\\u2019s doubled over and holding his stomach because he\\u2019s laughing so hard. He\\u2019s barely wearing any bathing suit. It\\u2019s like the guys are wearing thongs. I realize from listening to the conversation that they\\u2019ve had a competition, I guess it\\u2019s an annual thing at the family reunion of who has the skimpiest bathing suit. It\\u2019s just the men doing this. I notice that I\\u2019m surrounded by the generation of men who are having this competition. I wish that I\\u2019d known that before I got in the pool and was lying there. I would have stayed out of it because I feel out of place here. The reason they are laughing so hard is because the guy standing beside me only has a small amount of bathing suit and it\\u2019s just over his dick, like a half applied condom. They\\u2019re laughing because he wins this year and no one thought of doing that. It\\u2019s a bathing suit because it\\u2019s technically made of bathing suit material. I can\\u2019t remember how I get out of the pool, but suddenly I am. I wrap my towel around my body and make my way back over to where the mom is sitting. Then, I turn around in my chair and see some of these snakes around the edge of the pool. When I look at the snakes and then back at the scene in front of me it\\u2019s not the Jones family reunion, it\\u2019s the Weber family reunion. The two matriarchs do not get along, but I think they did at one point. Now I\\u2019m talking to Mrs. Weber and I see the oldest Jones son standing there in her reunion. He doesn\\u2019t see me. I saw his face for a moment and then he turns around and walks towards the pool where the men are gathered. I think this isn\\u2019t good because that Jones son used to be married to the Weber daughter and Mrs. Jones is not going to be happy to discover that the son is actually a member of the other family as well. Then the dream shifts again. I\\u2019m sitting in front of the Jones matriarch talking to her. I ask her if she was aware that the Jones son is also a member of the other family, the one she doesn\\u2019t want him to associate with. She questions me and says, \\u201cHow do you know that?\\u201d I tell her. Then I say, \\u201cAnd I think it\\u2019s true because if you stop for a moment and trace the lineage, you can see where the two families were once one family.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh no, you\\u2019re right. They are.\\u201d She gets really thoughtful and stops talking.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Colourful Night\\u201d I\\u2019m with my first boyfriend. It feels like we\\u2019re in Mexico. There\\u2019s a beach and an ocean. It\\u2019s nighttime but there are so many colors of lights and festivities of people gathered together. The sounds of music and lights are all off in the distance. I\\u2019ve been to Mexico and it feels like that colorful joyous culture. We\\u2019re walking along the beach at night. He\\u2019s telling me that he\\u2019s only here for a little while. I feel a bit sad about that. I want him to stay longer. As we walk a little farther on, it\\u2019s really pretty. It\\u2019s a white sand beach and there\\u2019s a moon. You can tell the color of the sand because the moonlight is bright. We approach a path leading down to the beach from somewhere else, and I can see it in the darkness. We turn up it and start to move away from the beach. There\\u2019s a night market with crafts and people who have made crafts and set up a makeshift vendor tent out of a few simple poles and some canvas or fabric. There are a lot of these makeshift tables. There\\u2019s a camaraderie kind of atmosphere as we walk through. They\\u2019re background noise though because we\\u2019re in conversation with each other and we\\u2019re walking through the market, we\\u2019re not stopping at the vendors or looking at their crafts or what they have to offer. We come to another path. We turn up it, away from the vendor market. It\\u2019s like beach apartments, flat, one level and very simple, obviously places where people sleep because the sound from the market and ocean is reduced here. I suddenly realize that I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re sleeping - I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s sleeping or where I\\u2019m sleeping. I\\u2019m getting tired and want to lie down and rest. He says we can sleep here for the night and indicates a door on his right. He says it belongs to his brother. So we open the door and right inside the door is a bed. We lie down on the bed and I close my eyes for a few minutes. I wake up and feel like it\\u2019s not that much longer but he\\u2019s behind me and his arm is around me. It feels soothing even though I\\u2019m awake and listening to the sounds around me. In a little while, he wakes up. We both sit on the bed and have a conversation where I tell him that I want him to stay longer. He says he can but there are a few conditions. He wants to be able to work on his art and he wants his own space. There was something else he wanted, but I can't remember. I think, \\u201cOkay, these are easy to fulfill and he already does that anyway.\\u201d Without any second guessing or additional contemplation, I agree. He seems really happy about this and so am I. We leave the apartment and walk back through the marketplace. We go a little farther and there are some raw materials like clay and wood. He\\u2019s poking through those looking for something he can use. I\\u2019m doing the same thing but not with the same materials. Some other people start to infiltrate the environment where we\\u2019re doing this right now. They\\u2019re talking to me and asking me what I want to use these materials for. They\\u2019re asking what he wants to use these for, too. There\\u2019s the feeling that they are causing a disconnect between us. I don\\u2019t want to answer all these questions. It doesn't matter to me what they think. I just want to collect my materials and see if he\\u2019s ready to go. That\\u2019s how the dream ends with this constant onslaught of interruptions that are obstacles to what I\\u2019m really trying to do.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Grandmother\\u2019s Shoes\\u201d I\\u2019m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I\\u2019m at the dining room table. There\\u2019s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It\\u2019s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I\\u2019m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s her or someone else. Maybe it\\u2019s her with someone else\\u2019s face but she\\u2019s not alive anymore. Here she is and she\\u2019s acting like Nancy but she doesn\\u2019t look like her. We\\u2019re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they\\u2019ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad\\u2019s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, \\u201cNo, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.\\u201d I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she\\u2019s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they\\u2019re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, \\u201cThese don\\u2019t look very comfortable!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYou might be surprised. Try them on anyway.\\u201d So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It\\u2019s too small and it\\u2019s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d I put it back in the crate. She says, \\u201cTry another pair.\\u201d I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they\\u2019re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they\\u2019re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there\\u2019s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren\\u2019t completely flat, they\\u2019re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it\\u2019s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, \\u201cGrandma, I\\u2019m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.\\u201d They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re a seven anymore. I believe I\\u2019m now an eight. But isn\\u2019t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say anything, but she says, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can\\u2019t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, \\u201cWait here one moment.\\u201d She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, \\u201cTry these ones on.\\u201d She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they\\u2019re flat and they don\\u2019t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they\\u2019re comfortable. She says, \\u201cYou can have them.\\u201d She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, \\u201cAre you guys ready to go yet?\\u201d They\\u2019re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re wearing Grandma\\u2019s shoes.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cYes, she gave them to me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.\"],[\"\\u201cDinosaurs\\u201d I\\u2019m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We\\u2019re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she\\u2019s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she\\u2019s telling me these things, she\\u2019s asking me what I think. I\\u2019m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I\\u2019m doing is I\\u2019m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we\\u2019ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, \\u201cMy coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.\\u201d She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I\\u2019ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it\\u2019s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it\\u2019s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it\\u2019s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They\\u2019re wrestling with each other but they\\u2019ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They\\u2019re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I\\u2019m stunned. I\\u2019m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it\\u2019s winter and it\\u2019s freezing. Now I don\\u2019t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they\\u2019re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don\\u2019t seem to see where I\\u2019ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I\\u2019ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they\\u2019re looking around but their bodies aren\\u2019t moving, They haven\\u2019t located where I am yet. They\\u2019ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I\\u2019m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can\\u2019t leave them in there! There\\u2019s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they\\u2019ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they\\u2019re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can\\u2019t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn\\u2019t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he\\u2019ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I\\u2019m up to now and they\\u2019re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to shred the door. I don\\u2019t have any boots and it\\u2019s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don\\u2019t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I\\u2019m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I tell her what happened. She\\u2019s strangely puzzled and doesn\\u2019t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Coffee Pot\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It\\u2019s snowing out. There\\u2019s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it\\u2019s still snowing. There\\u2019s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there\\u2019s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don\\u2019t. The house is brick. It\\u2019s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it\\u2019s taller than it is wide. It\\u2019s old. I can tell it\\u2019s old because the glass isn\\u2019t flattened by a machine, it\\u2019s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I\\u2019m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It\\u2019s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say \\u2018it likes\\u201d because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It\\u2019s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it\\u2019s mostly black. It looks like it\\u2019s made of cast iron but it\\u2019s not because it\\u2019s light when you pick it up. I think it\\u2019s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It\\u2019s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There\\u2019s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It\\u2019s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I\\u2019ll sometimes look for it. I\\u2019ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it\\u2019s going to disappear and come back again. This day it\\u2019s missing. I have a roommate. She\\u2019s more like a neighbor but she\\u2019s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I\\u2019m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I\\u2019ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I\\u2019m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, \\u201cHave you seen the coffee pot?\\u201d She continues to look at me but doesn\\u2019t nod her head yes or no. I say, \\u201cJust in case you\\u2019re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you\\u2019re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?\\u201d She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I\\u2019m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It\\u2019s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it\\u2019s happy. When it\\u2019s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it\\u2019s been. It\\u2019s like every time it comes back it\\u2019s a little bit different. Sometimes it\\u2019s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It\\u2019s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it\\u2019s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Passageway\\u201d The property we have is like a winery in the sense that there are wild grape leaves growing everywhere. It\\u2019s old. The house is made of stone. There\\u2019s a lot of land. We don\\u2019t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it\\u2019s sustenance farming. We don\\u2019t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren\\u2019t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I\\u2019m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it\\u2019s not one big cohesive unit, it\\u2019s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn\\u2019t know were there. I\\u2019m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it\\u2019s not heated. My dad tells me that we have to go and take stock of what\\u2019s in the basement because he has to list the house for sale. My brother and I go down there. The basement is super creepy. There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There\\u2019s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I\\u2019m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there\\u2019s a passageway that leads off. It\\u2019s like a crawlspace and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going in there. I turn around and my brother is gone. I can see his torch light and he\\u2019s in there looking around. How can he do that?! He\\u2019s in it for about ten minutes. I\\u2019m not freaking out, I know he\\u2019s okay. Nothing bad has ever happened to us in this place. I trust it, it\\u2019s just creepy. I don\\u2019t like all the slimy scuttling things and I don\\u2019t want them in my hair. I\\u2019m on edge. He pops out and I say, \\u201cWhat did you find?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what he says. This isn\\u2019t the first time he\\u2019s been in there and he was checking on what he had in there. He says it\\u2019s good. Then we go back up the stairs which are really rickety, and up into the kitchen. There\\u2019s a dug out place beside the kitchen; it\\u2019s just dirt with big stones. My dad is standing there and he says, \\u201cAlright, let\\u2019s go take stock of what\\u2019s in the barn.\\u201d My brother and I still have our torches in our hands but we put them out when we came up the stairs. The torches are all made of wax and now they\\u2019re shorter with more wax drippings on the outside because of the time we spent in the basement. We go out the side opening. There aren\\u2019t any doors, just openings. The kitchen does have glass on the windows. We go over a meadow into this other place. The stones are piled up. They\\u2019ve been chipped away into roughly big square shapes and stacked on top of each other, sawed and stuffed into the cracks to keep the weather out. Grass and bits of organic matter and seeds have grown in the sod. This is what the whole thing is made of, every structure. Now we go into the structure my dad calls the barn. It has a side entrance made of this sod packed stone. We go in there. The whole thing is one big open space which is why my dad called it the barn, except we never had any animals. There had been animals at some other point. We look around. Again, we take our torches. But the torch in this structure has never been lit. My dad has the lit torch. When we get in there, my brother and I put ours on his. Mine won\\u2019t light. My brother\\u2019s did. I\\u2019m calling to them, \\u201cWait, wait, my torch isn't lit!\\u201d He comes back. Mine is being really stubborn and takes a little while to light. It does but it's very dim, it\\u2019s like it\\u2019s wet and it won\\u2019t stay going very well. I\\u2019m not doing anything except trying to keep up with them. There\\u2019s nothing in there. There\\u2019s a place we didn\\u2019t explore, it\\u2019s another passageway off the barn. My dad turns around and says, \\u201cOkay that\\u2019s good.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you sure? Because there\\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. We need to organize this so that when the real estate agent comes, we have all the categories of all the places on this property written down and they\\u2019re evaluated separately or we won\\u2019t get the value we deserve.\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care. I just want to sell it.\\u201d I think he makes some comment about his age and says it doesn\\u2019t matter due to his age. I\\u2019m arguing with him and say, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s precisely why you should get out of this property what you deserve. You\\u2019re not working anymore. This is what you have to support you through your age.\\u201d Now he\\u2019s thoughtful. He just doesn\\u2019t feel like doing it. My brother and I decide to finish it on our own. We leave the barn with my dad and walk around the outside. I see that there are so many different kinds of fruit growing around - wild cherries, peaches, quinces, pears and apples. I wish I had time to gather these and preserve them. Now we\\u2019re back in the kitchen and have a little bit to eat, just some bread and a wheel of cheese. I don\\u2019t eat any of it though, I just give it to my dad and brother. Some others who are part of our extended family come to the table that is handmade out of wood. There standing there. Some of them have fruit in their hands and are eating as they gather around. This is where I identify my daughter and her ex-boyfriend. I say, \\u201cWe need to go back down into the basement and take more stock of what\\u2019s there.\\u201d We do this. My brother spends a lot more time in that one passageway. He\\u2019s growing something in it. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to move that though. Whatever it is, you need to move it before the real estate agent comes.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, I know.\\u201d Then he gets thoughtful and I can tell he\\u2019s thinking where he\\u2019s going to move it. He says, \\u201cMaybe I\\u2019ll just move it further back because no one is going to go in there.\\u201d I think he\\u2019s right. I worry about him because no one knows how far it goes. No one has gone far back including him. This makes me feel on edge again. Now we exit the side building. The real estate agent and lawyers will be here shortly. No one has gone through the barn yet. My brother, daughter, her ex-boyfriend and I light our torches and go into the barn. Mine is doing the same thing where it won\\u2019t stay lit but the barn is brighter because there are now four torches. I see the passage at one end actually connects to the house, but instead of going underground, it goes above ground and I find it odd that we haven\\u2019t noticed this before. The odd thing is that even though there\\u2019s nothing there and the barn is a lot dryer and there are no creepy crawlies and webs and spiders and night living things the way the basement had, I always feel a presence at my back like beings you can\\u2019t see that are in there. It\\u2019s thick with them and I can feel it. We go through the bends of the passage and we end up behind the house. I say, \\u201cInstead of entering the house through the side, my dad\\u2019s probably in there with legal people, we should go underneath so we\\u2019re quiet and don\\u2019t interrupt them.\\u201d We agree to do this, but the passage takes us into where they are. We\\u2019re sneaking around trying to be really quiet and all of a sudden my dad and the lawyers see us and we all start laughing. I say, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t think you would be here. We were deliberately trying to be quiet so we wouldn't interrupt you.\\u201d My dad remarks, \\u201cWell you never know where the passages in this house are going to lead.\\u201d Everybody thinks this is funny so it takes some of the tension off. However, I can\\u2019t shake the feeling that there are other people living in this house who we haven\\u2019t found. As I\\u2019m saying this, I look up and see the glow of a torch from inside the wall and it\\u2019s way up high in the place between the room off the kitchen and the kitchen, it\\u2019s in that wall. The wild cherry vines had covered it up but the cherries have gotten really ripe and they\\u2019re falling off because they\\u2019re so heavy and ripe, so I can see this crack in the stone. I get my dad to lift me up. I\\u2019m heavy, an adult size, so I can feel his arms shaking. He can\\u2019t hold me up for very long. I got a glimpse of people in there! There\\u2019s a dad and a mom. He puts me down. I say, \\u201cYou need to lift me up again. I saw a man with a hat on.\\u201d Someone else lifts me up and this time the arms are steadier. I see a baby strapped onto the mom\\u2019s chest and a young boy the age of nine who has covered his face with the same kind of pointy hat his dad has. I notice the mom has one of those hats, too, but the point of hers is tipped over to the side. There\\u2019s a whole room we didn\\u2019t know about and they live in this room. He puts me down and I say, \\u201cWe need to find the passageway that leads there to tell them the house is being sold.\\u201d I think the buyer is going to tear it all down and I\\u2019m worried about this family. We go through the passage again only this time we\\u2019re looking at the walls trying to find cracks. I know where this should be directionally. But once we\\u2019re in the passageway, it\\u2019s hard to keep your sense of direction. We\\u2019re in the barn again and I feel the presence. I turn around and this time it startles me and there\\u2019s the man with the hat and veil over his face. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the man from the room in the wall.\\u201d He says yes and I share with him that it\\u2019s going to be sold and I think it\\u2019s going to be torn down. He says he has nowhere else to go with his family. My brother says, \\u201cWell there is somewhere else.\\u201d He indicates the passageway where he has been growing things. The man says, \\u201cOh we\\u2019ve come from there and I don\\u2019t know if I want to go back there with my wife and kids. I\\u2019ve considered it but my wife wants to stay where we are and take our chances.\\u201d The dream ends with us having this conversation of where there is to go after there and the sadness that someone would even think about tearing down this magical place that holds so much history. We\\u2019ve lived there and survived. The water is pumped from the ground with the handle. We have torches. We don\\u2019t need the electricity. We\\u2019ve been able to survive on the fruit around the house. I don\\u2019t want to leave and neither does the man with his family.\"],[\"\\u201cOld Wrongs\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of strange building. I don\\u2019t know what it is, it\\u2019s the upper floor of something. There\\u2019s a hallway with a niche off to one side with two couches facing each other. There\\u2019s a long room that\\u2019s empty. I\\u2019ve been teaching in the long room - meditation, it\\u2019s a yoga teacher training. It goes really well. I\\u2019m happy with the session. The studio owner I used to work for is sitting on the couch when I come out after the session and she says to me: \\u201cI have no further need of your services. How much do I owe you?\\u201d She gets out a checkbook. I tell her that she owes me for all the sessions she booked me for, not just the one I finished today. She says, \\u201cOh I don\\u2019t have to pay you that.\\u201d I explain that she does because I turned down other work in order to hold those days open for her. Then she kind of freezes, the way they do in plays where one person freezes then the spotlight turns to something else. I see sitting on the couch across from us, a student of mine. He tells me that she has hired him to work for her. I say, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I\\u2019m debating whether or not to share with him how she treats people, just to warn him. Before I can say anything, he says to me, \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s asked me to come in for the next couple of Sundays just to see how I do.\\u201d I say, \\u201cIt sounds like you\\u2019re volunteering.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, she said that if I do a good job, she\\u2019ll pay me at some point.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you okay with this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cEh well, I was going to be around anyways, so I don\\u2019t mind doing it.\\u201d He tells me the times and dates that she asked him to come by and teach her group. It\\u2019s the other two dates that she booked me for. I\\u2019m thinking that just figures, she\\u2019s found a way to get someone to teach for free. He seems really uplifted or excited by the idea that he\\u2019s just a new fresh grad and already teaching a teacher training. He\\u2019s confident and stuff and I don\\u2019t really want to take that away from him, but I\\u2019m also really disgusted by this kind of treatment of the sacred teachings of yoga. There\\u2019s no way anyone fresh out of a 200-hour teacher training is experienced enough to pass on any kind of wisdom. She\\u2019s just using it as a money maker. I feel this frustration combined with disgust welling up inside me.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Talent Show\\u201d I\\u2019m at a Yoga Studio where I used to teach but stopped because they basically tricked me into working for them by promising me a certain rate but refused to sign a contract I asked them to sign. I worked for them for a whole month without knowing what I would be paid. They figured I would just keep doing it because I had formed an attachment to the people in the class. I\\u2019m just standing inside the front door of the studio. My son is with me. I see the owner\\u2019s daughter but I don\\u2019t recognize her at first because she\\u2019s lost so much weight, she\\u2019s even about six inches shorter, and she\\u2019s wearing a lot of eye makeup. I deduce who she is because she\\u2019s behind the desk, not because I recognize her. There are a lot of people and families in there and in fact it\\u2019s packed, which surprises me. The owner walks in and he gives me a cold glance and keeps walking. My son has mingled with the people, although I didn\\u2019t intend to stay, I need to get him to go home. The only reason I\\u2019m there is to pick something up from the desk. The owner\\u2019s daughter is looking for it for me. The director is the main person that wouldn\\u2019t sign the contract and kept telling me she was going to the next day and the day and the next day until I started teaching. She delayed until they thought it was too difficult for me to back out. She\\u2019s behind me and gushing about being so happy to see me. I feel like it\\u2019s a performance for the people standing around. She\\u2019s got one of her hands on each of my shoulders and she\\u2019s standing behind me but to the side. I feel repulsed by the fact that she\\u2019s touching me and pretending to be this beaming friendly person when she\\u2019s a viper on the inside. Then, it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being moved forward by the crowd. I move with the flow because I\\u2019m scanning for my son and I need him because I\\u2019m ready to go. The owner\\u2019s daughter is standing beside me and talking to me. We get into the actual practice room and there\\u2019s a stage at the front. There must be two-hundred people in there, families, sitting on blankets and towels. She asks me if I want to sit down beside her. I agree. Then I gradually take in what\\u2019s going on here. It\\u2019s set up for kids. All the kids are wearing costumes and there are three boys on the stage. They\\u2019re setting up for some kind of act. I finally catch up with my son and he says, \\u201cMom, can we please stay? I want to sing two songs.\\u201d The owner\\u2019s daughter indicates that it would be okay if we stayed. I tell him, \\u201cAlright.\\u201d We sit down. For the first act, you can\\u2019t even figure out what the boys are doing. They\\u2019re on for about ten minutes. Nobody is stage directing. It\\u2019s just really laissez-faire. Other kids are running across the stage as these three are acting out something, but it\\u2019s not cohesive, it has no direction. At one point, one jumps down from the stage really slowly and pretends to fall. The other takes a run from the side and slides across the stage. It just goes on and on. I think, \\u201cOh my god, we\\u2019re going to be here for hours and hours.\\u201d That\\u2019s how the dream ends, just sitting and waiting.\"],[\"\\u201cMain Duck\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It\\u2019s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There\\u2019s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There\\u2019s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there\\u2019s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That\\u2019s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend\\u2019s son who I\\u2019ve sailed with before. We\\u2019re having something to eat. I\\u2019m not very hungry. I\\u2019ve brought a few things to eat that I just don\\u2019t feel like eating right now, so I\\u2019m just waiting. People are deciding what we\\u2019re going to do for the day. We\\u2019ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It\\u2019s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There\\u2019s a town and we\\u2019ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I\\u2019ll just eat there when I\\u2019m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They\\u2019ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can\\u2019t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I\\u2019m hoping there\\u2019s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There\\u2019s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it\\u2019s really messy. I\\u2019m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There\\u2019s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, \\u201cWow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she\\u2019s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we\\u2019re just staying for three days. That\\u2019s okay because there\\u2019s not a lot to do here and I\\u2019d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don\\u2019t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We\\u2019re back in the reception room. The owner\\u2019s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he\\u2019s going to leave right now because it\\u2019s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he\\u2019s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend\\u2019s boyfriend tells me that we\\u2019re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that the opposite direction?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the direction we\\u2019ve been going.\\u201d I say, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I indicate where we\\u2019ve left from and where we\\u2019ve tied up and I say, \\u201cThis is south.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo here, I\\u2019ll show you on a map.\\u201d He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship\\u2019s made and we\\u2019ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We\\u2019ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn\\u2019t make any sense to me.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Gas Station\\u201d I\\u2019m in a university and I\\u2019m working there. I really like how it supports its employees. There are all kinds of extracurricular activities and they aren\\u2019t restricted to the employees, you're allowed to bring your families. I have both my kids in the swimming lessons. I\\u2019ve also found someone who\\u2019s quite adept in music and in fact he\\u2019s a professor in the music department, and he will teach my kids music lessons, as well. He can play multiple instruments. This is great and I\\u2019m happy about this. My kids can choose an instrument that they want to explore and they can use the same time slot for music lessons. They can change their instrument if they like, but keep the same time slot and teacher. The other thing that makes me happy is I\\u2019ve got it set up so they have swimming first then music lessons with a half hour to change in between. It means that one night is dedicated to this instead of having to be out every night. I actually did this in real life when they were little as it frees up more time in the week. My daughter, though, has been taking music lessons somewhere else. I\\u2019ve needed to communicate with her that she\\u2019s to come to the university now. I do this then lie down for a nap in my house. When I get up, she\\u2019s confused about where she\\u2019s supposed to be for music. She\\u2019s come into my room to ask me without realizing I was taking a nap. The action of coming in and leaving has woken me up. I get up and go out of my room. I see that my son has dumped out his legos and it\\u2019s all over the floor and I\\u2019m asking to pick it up because it\\u2019s time to go. Now I\\u2019m looking for my daughter to tell her she\\u2019s to be at university at 6 o\\u2019clock unless he wants to get ready and come with me now. She says she wants to come with me now. When I go back into my room to get dressed, there\\u2019s a woman in there. She\\u2019s painting the walls in my bedroom with a roller. I\\u2019m trying to collect my clothes and get dressed but I feel like there\\u2019s nowhere to change because there are legos where I normally would change and a woman painting my room. I feel rushed and unprepared as I\\u2019m trying to get my own self ready. I open my door so the door is like a shield between the woman painting and me. I just get dressed in front of my own open door, but I know she can\\u2019t see me so it\\u2019s okay. My son is ready. We go downstairs. It kind of morphs into my dad and stepmom\\u2019s house. They\\u2019re just finishing up dinner. I tell them I\\u2019m on my way to the university for swimming lessons. My stepmom says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve got a half hour to kill. Why don\\u2019t I go to the university?\\u201d She wants to have a talk with my daughter and is interested in having some time with her. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine, I\\u2019ll meet you guys there.\\u201d My daughter says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just go with Nanna, then.\\u201d Whatever it is I have to do with my son first, my daughter would rather be occupied then sitting there waiting. I agree to meeting there. The dream kind of skips. I get in the car with my son. I\\u2019m supposed to pick up my daughter at the cottage. The music lessons are over. We\\u2019ve gone to the university and both kids have had the swimming and music lessons. My daughter is still going with my stepmom and my son is riding with me. Now we\\u2019re going to meet at my dad and stepmom\\u2019s cottage. I need to get gas first. We\\u2019re on the highway and I go past the turnoff to the cottage. I see a sign for the turnoff. I go to where there is a sign at an intersection, but no gas station. I turn right, go up one intersection, but now we\\u2019re in the country - there\\u2019s no town, no landmark, no anything. I turn right again and see a gas station. I think, \\u201cGreat, all I have to do is turn right one more time and I\\u2019ll be back on the same highway as the cottage turnout. I\\u2019m stopping to get gas. The gas is on my bicycle, so I have to park the car and get the bicycle out of the trunk. The whole gas station area is graveled and it makes it hard to turn the vehicle in such tight quarters, as well as my bicycle. The pump is really close to the entrance of the house. The gas station is not very busy because there\\u2019s not very much traffic and it\\u2019s just in front of someone\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s a square\\u2019ish rectangular building and the drapes are drawn. I am figuring that someone must be watching from the house and will come out when they see someone at the pump. It\\u2019s hard for me to get my bicycle between the pump and the front of the house because it\\u2019s such a tight turn. It\\u2019s hard to do this. I have to turn the handlebars to turn the front wheel, then pick up the back wheel to do this. While I\\u2019m doing this, I see the curtain move and figure someone has seen me and will come out. This is the case. As my bicycle is in place, a woman comes out. I ask her if I can have some gas. She pumps a little bit into the tank on the bicycle then puts the rest in a mayonnaise jar and says, \\u201cThere, you should not run out of gas for a little while.\\u201d I notice now that my son has gotten out of the car and is playing with a bunch of kids, a couple years younger and older than him, near the front of the pump where the driveway is - it\\u2019s the entrance from the highway. I\\u2019m putting the bicycle back in the trunk of the car and calling him over. He\\u2019s not listening, he\\u2019s involved in a game where they\\u2019re kicking and throwing a tiny ball. I get in the car and start slowly driving it towards the entrance. The kids are moving a little bit but not very much. It\\u2019s making it difficult to maneuver the car because I can get speed up to get through the gravel and I\\u2019m not getting the hood of my car lined up with the driveway very well. I\\u2019ve also got the window rolled down and am calling him to get in the car. He finally responds. Now I\\u2019m telling the other kids: \\u201cCan you please get out of the way? Move towards the house. Move please.\\u201d They\\u2019re not moving. I\\u2019m just driving really slowly. It feels really heavy and onerous in my dreaming body. I finally get the hood of the car lined up with the exit and I leave. Now I\\u2019m at the intersection that was clearly labeled with the sign for the highway, and the sign is gone. I drive up the road looking for it and am thinking that there\\u2019s no way it could be this far up to the left. I turn around hoping it will reappear and I just missed it somehow. I never see the sign but I know it\\u2019s down to the right and my sense of direction tells me where I\\u2019ve come from. I just drive down to the right. My car disappears. My body slides down this passageway between innocuous looking grey buildings. As I\\u2019m descending, I start to see colors: green and red and a sunset orange. It spits me out. I\\u2019m in this interesting little town that looks like \\u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang,\\u201d an ancient Walt Disney Movie where the town is made to look old fashioned and magical. I\\u2019m fascinated by these buildings. I walk around a little bit in the painted area. I can see that the color stops when I look up to my left. I want to look around more first. There are some people there and I ask them what they\\u2019re holding. They look like shop vendors and the colored buildings are stores. This one lady has a farmhouse style platter for serving turkey and it\\u2019s meat but encased in a light flaky dough. She\\u2019s really proud of it and is offering me some. There are people crowded around trying to taste it, but I say no thank you and smile as though what she\\u2019s offering is appealing, even though I think it\\u2019s disgusting. I keep walking down the alleyway of that row of buildings and come out to another one. There\\u2019s more activity here. The things that make it move are made of wood, like the mechanics of this town are handmade, hand-chiseled and hand-hammered. So realize that I still need to be looking for the highway. I walk around a bit because it\\u2019s beautiful and I\\u2019m fascinated. Then I walk up and now I feel like I\\u2019m going through layers of time and hoping they won\\u2019t shift before I get back to my car. I go from the deep wood mechanical layer of downtown and back up the alleyway with the painted area of town. Sure enough, the painted brick buildings are still there and so is the lady with the flaky roast beef. I walk back up, but not up the slide I came down on because it\\u2019s like a brick chute. I\\u2019m walking, not sliding. I find the adjacent path up and can see the one I slid down, so am like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019m still going the right way. Everything is still in place.\\u201d Then I see someone else to ask just before I go back to the gray area. I tell her I\\u2019m looking for the highway and she says, \\u201cWhich one?\\u201d Now I realize I don\\u2019t know the name of it even though I\\u2019ve driven it so many times. She says, \\u201cThe only one I know is over there to the right. It\\u2019s Highway 86.\\u201d Now that she\\u2019s pointing, I can see the actual highway and a big green government sign that says, \\u201cHighway 86.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s the right one because it has a map on the sign. I say, \\u201cWhich road leads to that? None of them are marked anymore.\\u201d She indicates the one that I started going down even though there was no sign. I\\u2019m relieved to hear this. I get back in my car and start driving down that road. It does spit me back out onto the main highway. Now I have to retrace my steps because the little sign to the highway is still gone. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Race\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house with a couple of rooms. The rooms are spacious. There\\u2019s a dining room with some kind of chandelier in the middle of it. There\\u2019s a foyer between the dining room and living room. The foyer has a door that goes to the outside. The living room is also spacious with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The foyer that joins these two rooms is quite large with some furniture in it as well. I\\u2019m with another woman and two men. The other woman and the man have a relationship together. At the beginning of the dream I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re off in the shadows. I have a new relationship with the man that I can see. He\\u2019s white and has dark brown hair. I can see his features, they\\u2019re a little angular and pointy. He\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am and slim. We\\u2019re just getting to know each other. We talk somewhat. I have a feeling I\\u2019ve been set up with him but I don\\u2019t feel any energy with him and he\\u2019s a stranger. We do start talking. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing together really, but we move around the rooms and talk in different areas. I can feel myself starting to warm toward him. He can be interesting. I am starting to like him. The woman and the other man come out of the shadowy part of the dream. The man starts to talk to the man I was with. The woman approaches me and asks if we want to leave to go out for the day. We\\u2019ve both separately agreed that we do. The vehicles are motorcycles. The man I\\u2019m supposed to ride with seems to be recovering from some kind of injury and his buddy is asking him about the injury. He tells him that he thinks it\\u2019s going to be okay. Now I look and see him flexing and extending his leg at the knee. He says, \\u201cSee look, everything seems to be fine.\\u201d So, we put chaps over our legs and put on heavier coats. We go outside, get on the motorcycles and tour around for a little bit, then come back. We come back in. I'm involved in some meal preparation, as is the other woman. The two men are also doing things to help prepare. Then we have a meal on the table. We share the meal, all four of us. The other two recede into the shadowy part of the dream and leave me with the man I was speaking with and riding with all day. Now I can feel the pulse of a growing sexual energy between us. We explore this for a bit. We\\u2019re in the foyer when we\\u2019re doing this. The other man interrupts us and tells my partner that he needs to come out and look out the living room window and see what\\u2019s going on. My partner and I separate. The two men go into the living room. I\\u2019m tidying up and getting dressed. I see that there are a number of vehicles on the other side of the street, different models of Jeep from the more rugged safari type to the SUV type. Each one has a driver that has gotten out and they\\u2019re kind of congregating on the shoulder of the road. I can see also that some of them have been injured. The men are clapping each other on the back warmly like, \\u201cYou did it!\\u201d Others are rotating one shoulder up and back and bending elbows as though the shoulder and elbow have been injured but are now starting to heal. I notice that it\\u2019s a sunny day now whereas previously very little light was coming in the windows and it was semi-dark. This living room is very bright now. We\\u2019ve got a great big long console tv like the kind people would have in the 1960s that sits in a big wooden box. They\\u2019re starting to gather around to watch a big race. Some of the men that are coming in are quite elderly; whereas the man I was sharing energy with is in his forties. It\\u2019s a variety of males. They\\u2019re finding seats in this giant living room on the couches lining the walls. They\\u2019re setting up to watch this race together and it seems to be a really big event. I\\u2019m not interested in it, but I am interested in what\\u2019s going on in the backyard. I walk out. The living room exits into a greenhouse, like a sunroom, which then exits out into the backyard. I realize I\\u2019m in my grandparents\\u2019 house on the north shore and I have been all along. I\\u2019m looking for the rose bushes. All the gardens are only at the beginning with shoots, like the beginning of spring after a long winter. I\\u2019m just going from garden to garden to see what\\u2019s coming up. I go back into the house. I see the woman\\u2019s features now and it\\u2019s my stepmother. I tell her that there are some things coming up in the garden. She then just recedes into the kitchen. I check on the men in the living room and they\\u2019re still watching the NASCAR races. Then I notice that someone recently has cut roses and put them in vases in the sunroom. The roses are this deep pinkish red in the middle with light green petals around the outside. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat an unusual rose,\\u201d and I wonder who cut them and from which bush. I go back outside. Now it\\u2019s like the beginning of summer and everything has bloomed. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and I look down the length of the lawn. I can see the top of the boathouse and it has grass on it. I want to go lie there because I want to feel the waves and hear them under my body and soak up the sun. I go around to the side of the house first to see if the red and green roses came from there. No rose bushes there. There\\u2019s some kind of gardening shelf, just a little bench made of painted white wicker, with a small cupboard underneath. I open it up to see if I can find gardening tools. Somebody has already opened it and there\\u2019s a pair of gardening gloves and some shears and a couple containers sitting on the top of the bench. I wonder who has been wearing them and if it\\u2019s the person who has been cutting the roses and putting them around the house. I go a little farther and see that one of the plants is a Rose of Sharon but it\\u2019s not in bud yet. Then I decide to stop looking around the other side of the house and walk down the length of the lawn to lie in the sun for a little while. Then I can hear people talking, the doors opening, and people starting to leave. I know the race is over. I stand up and walk back towards the little bench to see if the gloves and shears are still there. I\\u2019m going to try and find some roses because I want to put some in my own room. My stepmother comes out and says, \\u201cYou really like it here, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s beautiful. Can we stay for a while?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think so.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good. There\\u2019s so much space. It\\u2019s nice not to have to squish myself into a room or turn my body sideways to get into a closet or out of a door.\\u201d She agrees. I say, \\u201cEven if I had a brand new house, they only make the bedrooms nine by nine now. I really like having a big bedroom.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, we can stay for a little while.\\u201d Then she recedes again. I go back into the living room. My friend and his friend are the only ones that remain. His friend asks him to come out for another motorcycle ride. My friend asks if I\\u2019d like to come and I say, \\u201cYeah, I would.\\u201d We get our motorcycle clothing back on and get on the bikes.\\u201d We\\u2019re driving down the highway. It goes around a bend and something I\\u2019m carrying, I think it\\u2019s a roll with a change of clothes in it, flies off the bike and I can see it beside the road. We don\\u2019t stop until we come to an outdoor cafe. I can feel that my right eye has tears in it that have been running down my face, but my left eye is dry. The friend of my friend says, \\u201cI wondered if you were ever going to express any of your grief. I can\\u2019t believe you haven\\u2019t done it until now.\\u201d I tell him that I was, he just couldn\\u2019t see it. He says, \\u201cHmm,\\u201d as though he doesn\\u2019t believe me, and then says, \\u201cWe should go back to the corner and get what you lost.\\u201d I agree and let them take me there.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Dream\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand the structure I\\u2019m in. There\\u2019s a room, but it's not really closed in. It has a ceiling but it\\u2019s almost like it doesn\\u2019t have any walls; it\\u2019s just a floor and a ceiling. It\\u2019s good wood floors. There are shelves but I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on them; they go in a vertical line, shelf after shelf, and there\\u2019s a walking space between them. At the far left corner of this room is a desk and a chair and a glass partition like the kind movie theatres have as a small ticket booth. There are no walls on this partition though - it just has the glass front where people would pass the money and tickets through. My daughter is sitting in there. She\\u2019s writing something or doing something on the desk with her hands. I can see a level below this floor. It starts around where the desk is and is about four feet lower. Again, it doesn\\u2019t have any walls and it extends back with a ceiling above it. I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s back there. There\\u2019s a guy sitting there and he\\u2019s also at a desk and he\\u2019s got a swivel chair. He\\u2019s swiveling around, getting something behind him, putting it back on the desk, maybe calculating something, typing it in, swiveling back and forth. This guy is somebody I just met. My daughter has passed something under the glass that I\\u2019m supposed to pick up. I\\u2019m on the same floor as she is. I need to get to the floor underneath and I don\\u2019t know how I get there, but I\\u2019m just suddenly there. As I go to pick it up, the guy sitting at the desk underneath the pickup window - kind of in the way- swivels his chair around and I have to lean over him to get it. I am trying to stretch my arm over him because I think I can reach it. I come within a couple inches of it but I can\\u2019t get it. Instead of swiveling back and forth in the same pattern and rhythm as he was, he deliberately stays there a little bit longer and makes body contact with me. I can feel a sexual energy between us. I\\u2019m intrigued by this but also feel that I need to finish whatever task my daughter passed onto me. I wait for him to swivel back the other way so I can grab whatever it is she passed me. It\\u2019s like a tube, it\\u2019s tiny and pen-shaped. I get it this time. It\\u2019s in my hand. I go back into the shadowy part of this lower level that\\u2019s on the same floor as he is. I\\u2019m doing something but I\\u2019m unaware of what it is. When I come back out, he\\u2019s standing up in his chair. My daughter has come out from behind her desk and they\\u2019re talking to each other. He kisses her on the mouth. She looks surprised and backs up a step. I wonder why he did that. I think they really do have a lot in common. Then the dream just ends. But there\\u2019s something else, when he kisses her on the mouth, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a golden light all the way around them both. It illuminates her surprise and it\\u2019s quite a beautiful light. I can see how golden and young and beautiful her features are. It doesn\\u2019t change the fact that she\\u2019s surprised, but it\\u2019s that the kiss left that beautiful golden light around her face and head.\"],[\"\\u201cIn the Bathroom\\u201d This is a weird one. In my dream, I\\u2019m in a shower enclosure. It comes as one unit, so there\\u2019s a bathtub and it keeps going up into the shower and you just step into it. There are pegs sticking out of the wall. I\\u2019m trying to pull the middle one out of the wall; it\\u2019s stuck and I need it to come out of the wall. It won\\u2019t move. I put my right foot up against the wall and brace myself. Then I put my left foot up there, too. I\\u2019m not standing on the ground. I\\u2019m pulling as hard as I can. It\\u2019s not like it releases so I fall back, like when you\\u2019re pulling something and you build up force and once the thing you\\u2019re pulling on releases, the force releases and pushes you back. So that doesn\\u2019t happen. It releases and I feel it release in my hands. But then I\\u2019m in a different bathtub-shower thing. The next one I\\u2019m in is a ceramic green bathtub. It has tiles on the wall like subway tiles. I\\u2019m doing the same thing. I\\u2019ve still got the peg in my hand. I can see the other kind of plastic enclosure beside me. I\\u2019m wondering how I got to be in the bathroom inside the bathroom.\"],[\"My boyfriend and I were robbed by three of my classmates.\"],[\"dancing at a drag queens party and laughing out

AKe had no beard, and we sat in the same row as this next to the window. It seemed a mix between the capital UTP with the San Martin de Porres school because of the altitude of the ceiling. Apparently it was post-quarantine and when Ake and I saw each other, I asked him for a hug and he agreed, then a deluge began to fall.

I realized that at home, in my room, because I was supposed to have that class that day but one of my classmates told me not to go because the teacher had taken me out of class. So I decided to go talk to the theory teacher why if I didn't pass the course, I couldn't graduate, and they told me that he was a bad teacher and that the lab teacher kicked me out because I was three times late. In my brain I thought that I had to graduate and that I had to get the theory teacher to accept another job instead of the lab grade.

moment, and say, yes, sorry, actually we do\\u2026.She is disappointed\\u2026.I am aware of the tension between my attraction to her and my feeling that we have to do the right thing, given the crisis

below\\u2026.Another guy is with me\\u2026.I let him drop down, then I stop him with my mind, and bring him back up\\u2026.He is freaked out\\u2026.Without these powers I would be scared up here on a tiny white seat, attached to a thin white pole maybe a thousand feet in the air\\u2026.Then I am down on the beach, sitting on the sand, looking out at the water\\u2026.Can I make a water spout

the other guy, so he is not discovered\\u2026.They quickly hide him, the teachers will not like this at all\\u2026.They hustle me downstairs, to a class where I will hopefully blend in\\u2026.Later, I

creek, look at me with mild concern, but do nothing\\u2026.OK, what do I do?....I wonder, should I jump over the water?....I could do so, it is not that far a jump\\u2026.Later, I go back to the

social good\\u2026.This is harder to do\\u2026.It is hard to stop people from doing what they want\\u2026.At another point, I see Levi our cat jump around the front gate leading out into the

The next part of my dream I was already in the car with a bunch of young boys but I was also younger. I\\u2019m actually not sure it was me this time but I was wearing cut off jeans and hiding something in my back pocket that I didn\\u2019t want them to see so I asked if I could use a restroom and they pulled over to a gas station then I got out of the car and remember looking at a pile of rubble wondering if I should do something about it before I went inside. Next, I went in and there were these old men leering at me. I tried to avoid eye contact with them and found my way to a bathroom. Then I woke up. When I woke up I thought I smelled the distinct smell of red wine-but I have not had red wine in my room or anywhere near my apartment. [nap dream]\"],[\"I had a dream that I was with Opal, a friend from yoga teacher training, and we were going to our last teacher training gathering and we were walking there but we were late. We were walking past the soccer fields and eventually we got a Lyft, but when we arrived it was closed and we were at the wrong address. I remember checking my email and finding that they had moved to Quincy Street and it was on an island. Meanwhile there was a soccer tournament and it was all young women playing soccer. I asked them if they had any under forty soccer groups and she said, \\u201cNo, it is mostly people in their twenties and at one time somebody came they were really old - they were like thirty.\\u201d We called again to get a Lyft to the new location and it kept saying it was a mile away and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was in a connected relationship with a man. In my dream he was very kind and nurturing, with a shared sense of humor. I knew him but had just met him, like my soul knew him. Physically he was tall, African descent, a body that enveloped mine in hugs, like I just melted into him. There was nothing familiar about my current life in that dream. Everything (locations, other people, etc) were new.\"],[\"I had a dream where the man from the first dream crept into the second dream. My recent ex was in the dream and we were skiing but I didn\\u2019t have the right gear (a helmet or a coat). I felt inadequate and frightened and he laughed at me. He kept wanting me to go break into a house \\u201cfor fun\\u201d which I thought was awful. I went to go find him and the house had little kids in it who were scared. I tried to comfort and distract them. The house was very modern and futuristic and I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to work the doors to get them safely out so I hid with them. The man from the first dream was gone by the end of this (he never went to the house with me).\"],[\"The dreams I remember mostly centered around my ex boyfriend and being unfaithful during our relationship and finding out later. In my dream I was confused and hurt. In real life I don\\u2019t think this happened but would not have been surprised, either. This is a theme though that comes up in my dreams about him often over the almost five years we were together. Wonder what else that may symbolize?\"],[\"Last night I dreamt that my late husband Caleb met me for a weekend away. He was young and I was older. We had a great time at a bed and breakfast, walking around and seeing my older sister Liz. We went driving back home but when I got off the exit it was all grassy and completely vertical. He agreed to take the car up the \\u201chill\\u201d so we got into two cars and I was following him but then I lost him. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my late husband\\u2019s best friend's wife, Candace. She invited her younger teenage sister over who was wearing a yellow bikini top and tiny black shorts with a robe. There were older guys at the house leering at her and I felt like this could be very inappropriate. In real life I\\u2019ve never met her sister but doubt this would happen. I told her to maybe throw some clothes on and they called me a prude and insecure. I was angry about it when I woke up.\"],[\"The second dream was like a horror movie where I don\\u2019t know if it was related exactly to the first dream but the family brought in the body and begged me to give it life. It felt like Frankenstein. The body was a young black man. He reminded me of a patient I worked with on the unit who was very violent (he broke a nurse\\u2019s leg) and I had worked closely with him. I don\\u2019t remember much else.\"],[\"It was night. I was invited to work offsite and someone (a colleague from NYC a decade ago) came to bring me there but I wasn\\u2019t able to navigate the muddy road in my shoes. We tried to go another way but there was a large stone gate covered in green moss. I told them to go ahead without me. Then, it was dark and I was in a city (maybe San Francisco) and trying to find my way home. I found a dog and tried to return it to this house and it was a dog rescue. They asked if I wanted cats, too. I am allergic but said I would meet them. They tried to get me to take three cats and I remember feeling scared that they weren\\u2019t declawed (in real life I don\\u2019t know enough about it but my sister has a cat and thinks declawing isn\\u2019t humane). In the dream there was a dog who came with us and we left the cats. I kept thinking about my ex\\u2019s dogs because I consider them mine and wondering if they would get along. I kept doing the math that it would be three dogs total (but it would be four). This dog was about 30-40 pounds with reddish golden hair like one of the goldens, Chuck. He came home with me and my dog Pinto. In my building we are only supposed to have one dog so I was worried about being caught, but knew my dog Pinto would be happier and wouldn\\u2019t howl when I left (he\\u2019s been doing that lately) because now he would have a friend. At the end of this dream we stopped at a Mexican restaurant and I couldn\\u2019t find the door in. Then I got a seat and had to get up to find the bathroom, but then woke up.\"],[\"I was a man (not me) and part of a gang/bad group of men who were smuggling something. I was driving a car underground - deep deep underground - and every time I would come to a fork in the road I would stop to ask the leader which way to go. We stopped at an underground diner and had sweet potatoes and blueberry pie, it was run by a large African American woman and she was hiding her kids from us and she was obviously scared and wanted us to leave. The lighting was all underground with candles and low lights on the walls.\"],[\"I was a young girl (not me) at some kind of college I\\u2019ve never been to. It looked like Chicago but I\\u2019ve never been there. It was dark/night and we were going out dancing. I was with a friend but also on a date with a guy. It was like an 80s movie. We went to a bar and by the end we had sung karaoke and ripped up our dresses - suddenly I was wearing a long wedding dress and it was ripped to my knees and glitter/color all over it like a Cyndi Lauper video or something. It was free and happy and lighthearted but there was an element of danger lurking.\"],[\"Dreamt that my younger sister was in the hospital and had similar rare chronic disease I have (or they think I have).\"],[\"I had a dream I was renting a room in a house or maybe like an RV from a guy. There was at least one other roommate. We were told to be careful plugging in our devices as they drained the system. When I went to bed I looked outside the window and saw trash and book bags on the ground, then saw older dogs sleeping outside. I didn\\u2019t know how I could sleep while these dogs were outside. I made eye contact with one who just looked so so sad. Then I woke up. The whole dream was set at night.\"],[\"I was wearing a fancy red dress and working some high level job as a politician. Some type of emergency (maybe a government attack) happened when I went to the bathroom. Some man I worked with in dream but not in real life followed me to the bathroom. I changed and then I woke up.\"],[\"This dream was surreal. I dreamt that I was with my high school friends at a basketball tournament but got stuck/lost somewhere. A young Ram Dass came to be with me while I was stuck in some kind of trap. It was intimate physically but not sexual. In some way he represented all teachers, all people. He was just loving me, literally it felt like I was being filled with love. I felt warm and peaceful, content. I have never dreamt of him or any other of my teachers before. I woke up immediately feeling warm and loved.\"],[\"I was driving down this road going over the speed limit. The sign said 50, although it was in a neighborhood so I knew it was over, and I missed a stop sign. It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow\\u2019s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I\\u2019ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids. Then I went to drive around looking for a gift of plates but all of the stores were closed. I remember bashing Trump in a few conversations.\"],[\"I was me but also wasn\\u2019t me - like me but not me now? I was skating around and around and around an indoor skating rink. There was a company offsite and I kept seeing people that I knew but I don\\u2019t know in real life but had met before in dreams. We were all going around and around. They were all faces of people I knew from some job but I never knew these people in my life now. It was all wooden and lit with artificial lighting and there was music playing and it felt like it was supposed to be safe but was not really. I didn\\u2019t want to stay but I couldn\\u2019t leave.\"],[\"In this dream it was deep deep sleep and it was dark out. I dreamt I was supposed to dance in a performance with my OT colleague Susan and my friend Kate who also works as an OT . We met and danced wearing clear gloves holding hands for rehearsal. Then we were supposed to meet for the final performance and I couldn\\u2019t get there on time. I was late and annoyed. I tried to get ready but had GI distress and then tried to do makeup but my eyebrows were gone. Then these men were coming down the road and I could see them kicking up dust. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a group of people and someone who looked like my older sister and we were walking in a place that looked like NYC, it was dusk, turning dark quickly. We saw an overweight man in a wheelchair at the top of the stairs and he asked us to push him down, we said no and he said it would help him get down the ramp. We started to walk away and he started to slide away and my sister caught the wheelchair. Then I think he had a dog with him. We all went to a dark place like a bar and these blonde women at the front were jeering at us and I lifted both hands and flipped them off (not something I would do in real life). It was forceful but dark and I don't know if they could see me. Another dream was I was in a large grocery store and people were eyes down scurrying around. Last dream I was watching a video of myself as a kid. I was injured and in some kind of sled on the grass but it was daylight.\"],[\"It was dark and I was at the store trying to buy eggs. I bought two hard boiled and two loose unboiled eggs but I dropped them when I went to the counter. I apologized to the clerk but they wouldn\\u2019t look at me. I was returning to a house I was remodeling, all made of wood. It was still dark but there were lanterns. I felt lacking, apologetic, not enough.\"],[\"It was dark, I was not me, I was an African-American woman and her daughter. I was both of them. The story played twice. I was one of them each time. There is a house we went to for safety and I think it was supposed to be a grandmothers\\u2019 house. There were old school hair mirrors on the vanity table. One night we left and it seemed like it was part of a wild game preserve or Safari or something - I don\\u2019t have a reference point for. They were giving tours at night to school children, I think. We weren\\u2019t supposed to be there so we stayed alongside the underpart where they couldn\\u2019t see us in the shadows. I remember holding onto the crumbling side of dirt and rocks and looking up. You could see the stars and you could see the man, hoping he could not see you. If you got out far enough you were free but it was dangerous like a desert. It was daytime in the desert and you could see it. The first time we went, I was the mom. I tried to hide behind a tree but he saw her and we had to get on our knees. Somehow we got away. The second time we did the same story and I was the daughter and we were much more clever. I woke up with my heart pounding.\"],[\"I was helping a slightly older couple sort through and donate clothing - I think it belonged to someone the man knew. I held up sweaters that did not fit him or were very feminine. There was a whole truck of them, some of the sweaters were not tightly woven or too small. I called my sister Sarah. In the dream she was my sister but we were the same age I think (in real life she was born on my 9th birthday).\"],[\"I was at a small bar concert or something and the woman who cuts my hair was a proxy for me to buy cowboy boots and jeans. It was night.\"],[\"I was in Asia and in a crowded bustling city at night. I was with two companions but they didn\\u2019t talk to me. I had several iPhones. We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I\\u2019m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn\\u2019t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn\\u2019t have it. I was staying alone in a hotel room that was like a train compartment and then it was dark and raining. I woke up sweating.\"],[\"I was in a dimly lit yoga class in what looked like a barn or wooden room and there was a front section for people who could practice on a mat and I was in the back on a seated section where it was darker. There were people with me but it was hard to see them. It was a teacher I used to see a lot on Sundays, and it was a class I used to go to every week before I got POTs.\"],[\"This one was more emotional. I woke up with mixed emotions. In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn\\u2019t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that\\u2019s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows\"],[\"My apartment building at night was outside. Instead of how it actually is, there were floor to ceiling windows and someone was showing me the closets and how they were different and somehow this explained why I was sick. Then this man invited me into his room in the unit and he looked like my ex\\u2019s friend Franco but was not him. He was sitting on the bed with prayer flags behind him and he was trying to explain something to me but I did not want to listen. In real life I have an aversion to him, his energy always feels like coyote trickster or something to me - like always up to something, so it was weird to come up in my dream.\"],[\"I was with my dog Pinto at a dog wash and it was strange I was on his level like another dog or his point of view at times. We weren\\u2019t talking with words, just emoting feelings. We were very connected and then we were leaving and I was me again and put him in a bright yellow rain slicker and walked him out. He was prancing and happy and proud. There was a man who I think has been in other dreams, he is kind with brown eyes and he is black and I think from Africa. He reminds me of my friend\\u2019s husband but it\\u2019s not him, just similar appearance and kind energy. I know he\\u2019s been in my dreams before and we aren\\u2019t talking but there\\u2019s an emotional transmission of some kind between his spirit, mine, and my dog.\"],[\"It was dark but like old western themed muted gray outside too. Women wearing long skirts lining up to practice shooting guns. Metal sounds clinking everywhere. Buckets of shells. Dirt on the ground. Dusty targets that were also like big bowls. Big wooden containers of supplies. Waiting in line for big guns. I could feel the vibration of the kickbacks from the shots. Big guns like shotguns, little guns and the targets. The big guns had bullets that came out with rubber tips that looked really phallic. I don\\u2019t remember much else other than it felt very purposeful and we weren\\u2019t talking or joking, we were training.\"],[\"I was in a room in a house and there was a workout video playing of doing floor abs and it was like 80s leotard old school. Something I haven't seen or thought about in years. It almost looked like a contemporary art experience. Then three loud noises \\u201cboom boom boom\\u201d and I woke up. My head on fire.\"],[\"I had a dream that my little sister Susan was having an affair on her husband with someone who reminded me of my ex. I was watching it like a movie and there were red long rugs rolled up in a big ballroom and they were running away. The sky and everything was navy blue like the ocean. I had no emotion - normally things like this even when I know I\\u2019m dreaming or wake up from the dream get me riled up for a minute but I felt nothing.\"],[\"I was on the phone with Rory asking him to \\u201cshut the fuck up\\u201d because the tv was on. Not in character for me.\"],[\"Fragmented dream. I was at work in our primary group room at the hospital with a few of my coworkers and my manager walked in for a huddle. We pointed up to the ceiling and showed her how it was buckling - it\\u2019s the kind of drop ceiling that looks white with a grid pattern- it was bulging with something that looked like pillow stuffing. We all went to get a closer look and see if we could fix it. There was also a magical component to the dream. I wish I could remember more but it was something like after this happened someone painted me with a wand and I had the pastel colors again and went for a walk by myself. It was so ordinary but it was otherworldly.\"],[\"Fragments: Dog poop. Driving to England stopping to change drivers with my father in law. OT practice changing positions then they brought a woman in on a stretcher and her family was there and then went into the dark. Dream about people and psychosis - top of building and pills, green goo on the ground.\"],[\"The last dream I saw my old friend Luke in the parking lot and he asked where I\\u2019ve been and invited me to a party on a train. I got to the party and it was like boxcar apartments on the train and everyone was playing guitar. There was some kind of game or guitar competition, but it was really crowded and while it looked fun, I just wanted to get off the moving train and away from all of these people, mostly men. Something about it didn\\u2019t feel safe.\"],[\"I was with my sister and her soon to be ex husband and we went to watch a parade but we had to stay in a big van and keep changing spots. My cousins were there, actually a lot of my dad\\u2019s side of the family was there. My finger was on the ground. There were cigarette butts on the ground. My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom\\u2019s favorite (she\\u2019s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is \\u201cI\\u2019ll fly away.\\u201d Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene. We were in the ruins of something and I thought we were uptown or in BK but then I realized we were closer to 90th street. I used to live on 89th in real life. I was back on the ground somewhere picking up trash and frantically trying to clean up this backyard dirt area where there were cereal boxes and cigarettes, and shove them into black trash bags. I felt panicked.\"],[\"I was driving over the bridge - I\\u2019m pretty sure it was San Mateo bridge - and I drove over it more than once but I don\\u2019t remember why. The road was really bumpy and I think I was by myself in the car the first time, and the second time I was with somebody else. I was in a big hurry and there were a lot of people driving over the bridge. In real life I never drive over the bridge\"],[\"I was in a neighborhood of people I don\\u2019t know and they invited me to come for a dinner in a garage. There were poster signs everywhere and there was a large blonde woman and some younger blonde children. She was celebrating something and making everyone food. When I came by I introduced myself and sat down and put on a face mask. She got angry with me and said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need that here! This has ruined the summer for my granddaughters!\\u201d pointing to them. I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really ruined the lives of people who died, and she said, \\u201cName them, name your patients!\\u201d I tried to explain that I couldn\\u2019t for HIPAA and that I worked in mental health and that many people are impacted right now in many ways, but she was so angry, foaming at the mouth and said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to have a plate anymore you can leave!\\u201d\"],[\"Another dream. I was with a younger black man and woman, they were wearing protective gear but I don\\u2019t think I was really a character/actor just a witness in the dream. They were in combat. They locked the door with the kind of lock that is a circular handle that closes safes. They were exchanging fire with people across the street. It was all under control. It was measured and it felt like the future.\"],[\"Another dream was just images of flowers being unrolled from a bouquet- side by side so it looked like Rory\\u2019s late wife Amelia showing me flowers and the spacing of the flowers being unrolled and they were tulips or some kind - that colorful.\"],[\"I keep dreaming fragments - I\\u2019m drinking water or eating breakfast. Kurt Cobain was in one and we were talking about something. I think I interviewed him about causing a ruckus at city hall once. There was a family breakfast I kept eating and then realizing I was NPO (nothing by mouth) in my dream.\"],[\"I have this image for this one: it\\u2019s a black-and-white picture of a young woman wearing a long black skirt and a white blouse and she\\u2019s looking at the camera. It is an older picture, maybe 1800s but I know that it\\u2019s my older sister Liz. I don\\u2019t know how to explain this but it is for sure her, but it\\u2019s not looking like her. There\\u2019s a look in her eyes that is familiar to me. Her birthday was 6/21 but we didn\\u2019t really talk. The emotion is kind of lonely and scary.\"],[\"I had a dream we were at this house of an old old high school friend named Aidan. I don\\u2019t talk to her at all anymore, she lives in Virginia. She and her husband were inviting me over for dinner and then the doorbell rang and a very tall and handsome man arrived and hugged me but I only came to his midsection which is strange because I\\u2019m tall. The ceiling in their house was really really low, and that\\u2019s another theme I\\u2019ve noticed lately too like I\\u2019m too tall for all of the structure; and then the man that arrived was there for me. He was there to pursue me. I liked his energy but could not see his face. I didn\\u2019t feel ready for any kind of dating stuff and wish it wasn\\u2019t put on me like this. (None of this is happening in real life, so far from a thought given current medical stuff). I go downstairs and my dog Pinto is there and there is a black and white cat playing hide and seek with him. At first it is cute and then the cat starts to hold him down and he is struggling and I am screaming her off and they are all laughing like it\\u2019s not serious but it is; they told me to just let the cat play with him and I said, \\u201cNO he is not to be played with.\\u201d I was so protective and angry. And they were laughing. I\\u2019ve felt like this before.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me- I was a woman like me but she was rich and coiffed and she was purchasing a home. It was a preview of the home with everything encased in plastic so it could be wiped down, even the art on the walls. I watched her walk to a white van with a man and then I woke up.\"],[\"I\\u2019m struggling to recall everything but I have these intense memories of being with a group of people and bonding intensely because we had to and meeting in an apartment in a dark apartment somewhere. I don\\u2019t know if I was me but then we all got into this train together and someone else had to drive it. This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like \\u201coh shit\\u201d and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.\"],[\"I\\u2019m talking to someone else remembering a time with my daughter. I\\u2019m a black woman - black with very little hair and a strong body. My daughter and I ran away. I think I\\u2019ve dreamt about them before running. This dream was both flashing back to the work on something that looked like present day and then flashing to a memory reel, some of it like old pictures. The current flash was this embodied sense of hard work - we were working with a group of people on these box cars to outfit them for something; there was conflict and confusion amongst us but out in the world there was war. We had to work stealth and fast, always at night and these boxcars had to be undetected. The flash to the scenes with the daughter haunt me. I can almost hear her voice and she\\u2019s talking about going to New York City and riding around in the backs of trucks and the image is the mother and daughter in a black and white picture in the back of an old truck holding onto a mattress and the narrator is talking about letting her daughter decide where to go and zooming in on the daughter\\u2019s face smiling but it\\u2019s sad and creepy feeling like something bad happened to the daughter and it just made me want to turn my light on as I write this. It\\u2019s in black and white. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a group of older ladies on a trip and there was a scene of getting back into the back of a mini van to go home. They had to arrange themselves like squished in the van.\"],[\"In a very vivid scene, I was away somewhere but I was NOT me. I was with someone I didn\\u2019t feel safe or comfortable with. I was choosing an outfit of clothes that I\\u2019ve never seen in real life but in my dream I knew how they would feel on my body, how they would sound (and of note the sound of one of the pants was going to bother me). It was a pink or blue outfit. Pants, turtleneck (I never wear), and vest. They came and made fun of me or something and we left. I returned to the same room with the turtlenecks but I was someone else again or a different time period, but the same person. I had cowboy boots. They looked similar to mine in real life. They were sitting outside the door, and I was going to have to leave them there to go inside the wooden door and do something (maybe it was a spa) and there was a pair of small black rain boots as well. I was inside either a cabin or a temple or spa. There were signs of people but I didn\\u2019t see anyone. I was feeling an urgency to make a decision and leave.\"],[\"I was with a group of people all coupled up. We were younger and we wore plastic bags over our feet to walk downstairs. I don\\u2019t remember much more.\"],[\"River, Highway 280, dark, my dog Pinto, paddle board, watch slipping off, Pinto almost going, Rory on phone, smoke, storm coming, return tomorrow to get watch with Rory. With a group of people from work like on a field trip going to a care home and schools. All wearing masks like it\\u2019s a part of daily life. There are some of my psych patients there too and this lady giving a tour is an OT, but I can\\u2019t place her for some reason.\"],[\"I was driving in the same universe but in a car. I stopped into a small town and it was snowing. There was a movie theater and a menswear shop. I went into the shop and saw a friend of a friend who I knew from working in San Francisco a long time ago. I haven\\u2019t seen or thought of them in years. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I had a dream that I was waking up, which was actually happening. My brain was processing all the images and feelings and emotions and moods and I was categorizing them. It was like I was watching my brain work while I slept but I was still waking up. I can\\u2019t remember content; it was more just the operational bird\\u2019s eye top level view of sorting and organizing.\"],[\"This dream involved drumming and fire and dancing and it felt like there were negative vibes.\"],[\"This was so fragmented - I had a dream that I was watching myself on a phone call on a corner having a serious conversation about something and then watching a neighbor come across me who was across the street from me. They had ching length white hair. They seemed pleasant and they had a red hammock that I could use when I came to knock on their door later that was all in the bushes.\"],[\"Half or full asleep - not sure - open door, shadows almost like visions of trucks going by, marching. All grey and green.\"],[\"A white room. My ex Rory was outside the door and I was inside. I was creating art or something on the floor. I had pot that was spilling everywhere and red wine, but I didn\\u2019t want him to see it. There was another part to the dream where we were in a house and having sex with each other but by extension with other people in other rooms but it wasn\\u2019t a graphic or sexual even. It was matter of fact. I could be where I was and be experiencing what they were experiencing. I was just experiencing people. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it.\"],[\"I was me I think and I was with a group of other people I\\u2019ve never met. We were at a store of some kind, maybe a children\\u2019s store and people were not wearing masks. Something happened: one of the men was bad and he got injured. He tried to take me and run away but I ran with another woman and I didn\\u2019t quite trust her either. We were suddenly driving at night on the streets where I grew up (kinda) and all the kids were camped out in tents on the football and soccer fields at night and only some of them were wearing masks.\"],[\"Two dreams blended into one. In one part, I was in an apartment townhouse sharing with people that I barely knew or liked and there was a strange man. I didn\\u2019t even realize that he lived in the entire upstairs room with an entire upstairs living room and that there was a walk up to the attic just for a breath of fresh air on the roof. I was telling the person who showed me that it was just like this other place I had lived. I think it was supposed to be New York or San Francisco. At the house where we live, we were doing experiments and these elementary kids would come and get dropped off for therapy sessions.We were allowed to leave but yet we were in. One night I played the piano and then snuck out with someone to have a cigarette (something I haven\\u2019t had in years and years). Next, I\\u2019m still outside in the same dream smoking. I think I was supposed to be in New York or San Francisco. There are these big hills and big avenues and we were trying to find a place to sit outside and we saw the Polynesian parade going by. It was dark. There was this dog rescue in the basement of this house/townhouse. There was a girl cleaning the dogs up and trying to take care of them.\"],[\"I was in a movie or something where I was driving down the coast of some beach town in a car with my ex following. He was trying to catch up to me but I was ahead of him.\"],[\"I have no idea where this dream came from but it was attached to the end of the crystal dream where somebody was showing us their teeth and they had inserted Christmas lights and got tube lights to go on their teeth. We were saying that this wouldn\\u2019t stand the test of time but someday they would be sorry that they did this.\"],[\"I was at the water's edge and I was with a bunch of people including a little boy that was also my current dog, Pinto. He kept diving underwater and wearing his mask and I was really impressed that he could use his paws to don and doff his mask. But he kept shooting down underwater for long periods of time and it scared me and the water was kind of grayish green and murky. When he was a little boy he had brown hair and he was two or three maybe, cute and chubby.\"],[\"I was in an apartment somewhere and it was shared with another person like a roommate. My ex Rory was there and he was making fun of me but also asking me how to sit for meditation. I showed him first how to sit just on his heels. Then I shared a butterfly position, then easy sit, half lotus, and full lotus. I\\u2019ve never been able to sit in full lotus (usually easy sit or half with left leg up) but when I did, it felt wonderful. So grounding, so balanced, so energetically healing.\"],[\"I was with a group of people in a huge storage barn or something with light streaming in all sides and I knew at least 1-2 of the people. One looked like a friend's father from growing up. We were trying to find safety and things kept falling from the top of the storage and hitting people in the head. I would look up and call out to people to watch out. I saw things coming my way and was able to deflect them and people were like, \\u201cHow did you do that? That was amazing!\\u201d and I was like, \\u201cI just looked!\\u201d There were these big long boards that would break in half and hit people. Then something changed and the dad moved us against a metal looking fireplace that had an under-hang and said we would be safe there and I said \\u201cmaybe it\\u2019s an earthquake!\\u201d And some others said \\u201cwe didn\\u2019t think of that!\\u201d But there was also a danger outside.\"],[\"I was driving along the coast near Daly City but it was a dystopian wasteland. I went to view a house or apartment to buy and it was in a neighborhood set apart from the wasteland area, it was really nice: the kitchen was so big and countertops so long with a view of the ocean. The window to the ocean looked like a circle like the kind of window from a ship as if I was looking out from a cabin. When I looked closer the ocean was full of boats, all kinds of boats and big waves and there was fighting. Someone in the room said to me that was why the place was so cheap (because it has a view of the fighting). I was sad and confused. The sun was shining. The sea was so blue.\"],[\"I dreamed about another baby bird only it was smaller and it didn\\u2019t breathe. It was also blue.\"],[\"I was with someone I knew, maybe a friend or sister and we were sitting down and going to take a picture of ourselves, but no matter what I did I couldn't get the selfie thing right.\"],[\"I was with my late husband, Caleb. It felt like his energy. Grounded, safe, playful. It was dark. We were walking my dog Pinto in a stroller but making plans to see a movie and run a marathon. I lamented I wasn\\u2019t wearing correct footwear. He had to go do something and would be back. I said okay, I started to race without him, trusting and knowing we would figure it out. I said my only goal was to finish the race. He wasn\\u2019t there when I said that but somehow I heard him say, \\u201cjust being in the race is the goal.\\u201d He found me after I started the race and we stopped and went to the movies. We were so content just to sit together, just like before he died. He reached over to hug me and it was so real it woke me up. I swear it felt like he was here.\"],[\"In my dream I woke up and I was in my apartment but it was the inverse layout and the lights were on. There was nothing on the walls, except there was this strange out of place headless glass bust on top of the TV. It was so out of place. I went to get water and felt like someone was there and things started falling out of the water tray but they were words and ideas not water. Later in this dream a PT I work with called to ask how to get her driver\\u2019s license and I consulted with Rory for some reason and I was annoyed by this. She said she was running late but on her way. I kept thinking, \\u201cWhere are we going and she needs to quarantine!\\u201d\"],[\"I was at Esalen for something but there were lots of families staying there. We were kind of in pods away from others but I didn\\u2019t have a pod, it was just me and some other people who were way younger than me. At some point in the dream I got drunk on red wine, it was overflowing from a plastic margarita cup (I have no reference point for this) but I had just hooked up with a cute young guy (also totally out of character- the whole scene actually pretty ego dystonic for me). Later in that dream or a new dream, I was working on something and someone kept asking me to bring mural supplies to make a giant sign. They wanted this one kid to work on it and this annoyed me. I don\\u2019t know why maybe because someone was telling me what to do?\"],[\"I was with my sisters and my mom or a woman who represented my mom (who passed away when I was 20). We were like a group of Thelma and Louise type characters running from town to town and we were getting chased by police, there was even a water chase scene on jet skis. Then I woke up.\"],[\"Family meeting with patient A (who happens to come from money) and a poor patient C sitting in the dark. I sat with the poor patient in the dark. I was so angry with the team for giving so much time to the entitled patient.\"],[\"I was with my friend Emily and she was pouring champagne into glasses and she had some pre-poured in her cupboard! However she drank first and then gave me one but it was a large round cup. I was disappointed it wasn\\u2019t a champagne flute but didn\\u2019t say anything. She said I could stay and watch a movie if I was lonely. I explained that I tried reaching my sisters but that they were busy. In my dream I saw an image of my sister Anne and her family dressed up like fancy Santa and elves and they were doing a family photo shoot and kind of snobbish. Then I went back to my other dream.\"],[\"I was taking a car to a parking lot that was also inside of a house. There were young black valets and I think they thought I was a \\u201cKaren.\\u201d I wanted them to know I wasn\\u2019t. I got out and went inside this house and it was HUGE and super nice and somehow mine. Not a reality for me. It had wide stairs but in order to go up, I had to go down and it was frustrating. When I finally got upstairs an alarm went off so I turned around to go downstairs and had to go up before I could go down! Then I woke up. The stairs were like pool table green with big mahogany bannisters.\"],[\"I was renting a house for Christmas or beyond and I had my own decorations and furniture as well as the ones that were there. My sister Sarah arrived and was trying to help but was annoying me. She was asking if I did this or that and I just wanted to be left alone. I had a long handled lighter for a candle and couldn\\u2019t get it to work and it broke and was leaking fluid everywhere. Then I woke up annoyed.\"],[\"I was with my ex Rory, and we were traveling somewhere like doing a condo or a timeshare or something. When we got inside we were trying to close the blinds and they fell off and he was like, \\u201coh this happened when I was here before,\\u201d and I was like, \\u201coh that\\u2019s annoying.\\u201d The people who worked there were sitting outside looking through the window and not helpful at all, just rolling their eyes. He had shared that he\\u2019d been there before with his late wife and I was like, \\u201coh where are we?\\u201d and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was driving on this road and I got off thinking that I was going somewhere in relation to the water's edge, but it was like a place I\\u2019ve never been before in real life and it just took forever. I kept driving and driving and driving and it was on these windy two lane roads and I thought that I would\\u2019ve been there already. Then I was told that some people make that commute every day\"],[\"I was with one of the attendees, Dr. Donovan, again and she took me dress shopping. We were going to a place where I had gotten a wedding dress before and this was in the dream not in real life. We arrived and this lady was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have time, just try these on and you can buy them.\\u201d She started pulling dresses off the shelves and Dr. Donovan was like, \\u201cwell what size do you think she is?\\u201d and she pulled down my top to show her how much bigger I was there when I got married. The lady said, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have room to put a ball between you and another person so probably a large or an extra large, just go grab them.\\u201d So Dr. Donovan and I went to go find large and extra-large off the racks. We got the sequined short dresses - I would not wear them right now in my current body...and we are in this big huge boutique and running around to find everything. They were in all these different colors like pink and they had sparkles on them. When I looked up beyond the store there were other aisles for big box store type stuff, but it looked like we were still inside of this boutique.\"],[\"I was walking along a main street where everything was fucked up from water damage and my friend Emily had a shop that I didn\\u2019t know she had until then and it was ruined but it was like a paper shop and she needed to place these big bottles in front of the machines.\"],[\"I woke up in another dream where I was recovering at a house but the house was for sale, so I had to make it presentable. I\\u2019m trying to remember the details on this but I was also watching the interactions between a couple. There was a man and a woman who were together and he was trying to make friends with all of the single women at the party and make plans to see them and his wife was like, \\u201cdude take a break!\\u201d\"],[\"Then I had another dream where I was visiting. I think I was back home in Virginia and I needed to crash somewhere and I don\\u2019t know who the friend was but he was explaining to me that his relatives had this townhouse. They had just gotten it as a deal because the owner had died by suicide in the closet. Actually now that I\\u2019m thinking about it, it was my ex Rory and the people that live there were his mom and his stepdad, but it wasn\\u2019t them - it was definitely not them really - it was just like his mom\\u2018s voice was the lady. In any case the place was a disaster. There was food all over the floor and it was really unkempt with stains everywhere. They kept saying that the middle level of the townhouse was cold and that\\u2019s where the person had died by suicide in the closet. They kept making references to it like it was spooky and it just made me sad for the person that had been there before. It looked like the street I grew up in Virginia but it was townhouses instead of small houses. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with a family like on a family vacation and we are fighting over wood beds to sleep in. I lost my shit on one of the sisters. I mean these are not people I know or am related to or who look anything like me. One of them was leaving the next day and she wanted to sleep in this bed. I lost my shit on her and it was really interesting to see the family dynamics of another family and it was me, maybe the dad, and two sisters.\"],[\"I had a dream that I was with my ex Rory somewhere but it wasn\\u2019t Rory and it was with the dogs but it wasn\\u2019t the dogs and they were kind of like stand-ins. Then I bought a chair, kind of on a whim. I think it would be a good chair for this outdoor space at the place we are renting for the week. I went inside to take a shower and it rained, and the chair got soaking wet. When I realized that Rory didn\\u2019t bring it inside I asked him why and he said, \\u201cwell you bought the chair,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cwell were you looking at the chair? I didn\\u2019t know it was going to rain,\\u201d and he just shook his head at me. I was really pissed off. Then one of the dogs, Trevor, was a lab instead of a golden retriever and he started to slip off of the deck and I went to catch him before I woke up.\"],[\"I had a huge family of people I\\u2019ve never met in real life and they were all coming to visit me somewhere. I was trying to help all the kids get to sleep and offering them different quiet activities. I think I called them quiet leisure activities, LOL.\"],[\"I had another dream where I went to go interview somebody and they were from the Native American culture. I\\u2019m in the bathroom. They had a really disorganized display of towels and things with animals and Native American sayings on them. I think some of the animals were bears. When we walked out of the bathroom somebody with all black hair and black face walked out behind her like a ghost and it really startled me. I asked about it and somebody said something about things following you around.\"],[\"I was on this moving platform of things and my dad was there. I was embarrassed by him because there were other people I knew from work, like attendings etc.\"],[\"I was a younger black teenager and I challenged my older brother to a fight and I knocked myself out into the wall. I was narrating like a movie.\"],[\"I was going to fly and we got on this rolling cart of people including this couple and the woman had these multicolored pastel bowling shoes.\"],[\"I was riding along as a passenger in an old beat up pick up truck. We stopped at this old town and got out. We walked inside this tiny little gift shop and it was like walking in circles. I couldn\\u2019t fit anywhere, it was like a doll house. There were boxes all over the floor and I kept thinking, \\u201cthis is not ADA compliant.\\u201d\"],[\"I was at work and my colleague erased my quote from the board...I wasn\\u2019t mad I was just confused\"],[\"I was moving out of a room or suite from my best friend Aidan\\u2019s house and she was helping me move. We have packed up all the boxes and are making sure we have everything. There are all these clear containers. Then I was getting dressed and she was carrying everything down faster than I could. When we walked out her mom was lounging around outside and there were all these stairs, lots and lots of stairs. I said a joke about how she was a Sherpa and it was really funny. Then Aidan and I went out somewhere and it was during the pandemic but we were in high school like we were when we were best friends and yet we were both wearing our work clothes for some reason and my badge had University Health care. It was hard to see and it said 9 to 5 and we went into this police station or Fireman's gym and they really go \\u201c95\\u201d like it was the call number for a place that they knew. I was embarrassed to tell them it was a particular university, but 925 meant something in the dream.\"],[\"I was on a plane with a team and the plane got shot down. They thought someone was coming to save us but they were shooting at us and we hit the ground running. I picked up a Pisces picture and others. A craft fair and handkerchiefs. Lying but not lying. These were the same handkerchief as the other thing I got. I didn\\u2019t realize it until I pulled it out. The colors were purple and teal and then a design. Other fragments: my first year; Marathon shoes; Makeup bathroom; Cinnamon rolls and blueberry and bordering ahead for next day; Japan shoes off; New shoes running training alternating and two other people; Turning gas off/on way down the path- neighbors and dogs jumping. It looked like my old house growing up. Cleaning out the bathtub, bad vacuums and trash bags, I think I was moving and I sprayed the cleaner on the walls and it was peach and teal and I cleaned while I showered.\"],[\"I was in a yoga studio and crammed in trying to go to class and I couldn\\u2019t see the teacher and I was annoyed at the people around me because they were acting really immature.\"],[\"This dream was probably based on the movie I saw tonight before I went to bed: something about the vast of night. The dream was about carrying a family\\u2019s history in the car on the highway. My dream looks different than the movie but the idea was similar which was I was carrying the stories in a car and I went to go drop them off somewhere for someone\\u2019s family history.\"],[\"I was at Costco or something and I went to go check out a VHS or a CD movie and because of Covid he put the helmet on me, and then he put on a VR helmet.

The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn\\u2019t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I\\u2019ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn\\u2019t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn\\u2019t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn\\u2019t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn\\u2019t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.\"],[\"I was in a tiny house with my husband that was glass (or mostly glass: had a lot of windows).

It looked like a cheap Korean spa\\u2014beautiful materials were used like jade flooring but it was damp and the floor uneven and I had vertigo. I had invited my mom and sister and niece to live with me. There was a noise in the downstairs portion of the house and it was a child that was completely deranged/a monster really. It had a gun and was shooting at us. I got a gun and I was fumbling with it, I was so scared! I dropped it and it rolled down the floor (very sloped uneven floor). I ran to it and tripped and almost had it when the monster was standing over me with the gun. I shouted \\u201cbehind you!!\\u201d And the baby turned and shot my mom! I felt so guilty it was my fault I ran to her and the baby was still shooting. I got the gun and shot it. It rolled very gruesomely all the way down the uneven floor to the door and down the stairs. It was horrific and bloody. And my mom and this random monster baby were dead and I had to do something but I knew no one would believe what happened! I had to make up a lie blaming my mom for it all. I didn\\u2019t want to do it and I forced myself awake.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room.

This is a love story, though not a waking life idea of a love story. Traveling through Asia as a college kid, following in with an anarchist gang and getting into a lot of trouble. Fleeing a penitentiary sentence I escaped to an island and found my true love. He didn\\u2019t believe in marriage or monogamy and I found space to allow his love in my life and not have it be the center of my life. I accepted his conditions. I raised our child kind of solo with him in and out for long periods of time. He ran a hostel on the beach which is where I met him. There was never a sentiment of hate or resentment. At some point I decided to leave the island with my kid and travel back to the states and settled down there for a while. When the child grew up I returned to my nomadic Ways and wandered back to the island. There were no phones or anything like that but I found my love at the hostel and we settled in together there until he died. This dream spanned from age 18 to 70. I was grateful for what I had. I didn\\u2019t control or expect anything, which is weird, because it is not how I am in waking life. I woke up missing him. I accepted a lot of limitations, particularly with my lover, and surrendered to it - having a beautiful life with and without him. I chose love over what I thought was due to me.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room. The paint on the walls was old and chipping and the carpet was raggedy.

And then there was me, a researcher. I take over research from my predecessor. No talk of who that was or where they left off or where I was to start. Joyous and also conspiratory. Conversations hushed when I\\u2019d come in. There was something everyone knew that I didn\\u2019t. No one was unwelcoming or overly welcoming but something was amiss. Something subtle. There was a small Market across the street, the only place to get food but we were a farm so it was confusing. What were we farming? I remember wondering why there wasn\\u2019t a barn and asking about it. I was in a place of questioning everything, a feeling of excitement and also of distrust. There was a knowing that my aunt's house was close and that I\\u2019d grown up seeing the farmhouse. The overall feeling of the dream was eerie, even if the actual events weren\\u2019t blatantly so.\"],[\"\\u201cChosen\\u201d Flashback to my teenage years. Teenage girl having to hide her blood was told her blood had a disorder. \\u201cKlingian or Klingon blood.\\u201d She had to be on the run. Then when One child was born, we had to run away with her in the car. No car seat just bundled in the truck in a basket. On the road just us two, stopped at a pond on a cliff-an old lover was there - Steven. He was hang-gliding and shirtless and offered me a moment of comfort. It got tested while we were gone and had to hide again. There was a hang glider on the edge of a cliff.\"],[\"People are walking around in a circle, in a kind of hohum way, just doing their business. I see one of my friends and she\\u2019s walking with a man who is her boyfriend. I see that they\\u2019re just staying together - so they\\u2019re just like, okay we\\u2019re just doing this even though we don\\u2019t really enjoy each other or what we\\u2019re doing together. Then the scene shifts and I\\u2019m walking down a road through a safari setting and there are big predatory animals like bears and lions and also giraffes and things like that. Then I know that just ahead of me in the bushes there will be a mother pig and her little piglets. Behind me I sense a big boar stalking me. But I know that in order to save myself, I have to kill the mother pig. So when I get to the mother pig (this is the third or fourth time the dream repeats itself tonight, like a loop) and I actually do it this time - I have to take her, rip her out of the bushes, away from her piglets and throw her down to the ground three times to make sure she is dead. Then I can keep going.\"],[\"This dream is remembered in fragments. It\\u2019s a little disconnected in my memory. In one part, a group of us has set up a puja to Ganesh and the puja is set up outside of the temple because that\\u2019s where we\\u2019re supposed to do this particular service or worship. However, somebody has decided instead to take down this ceremony and move it to the inside of the temple and use the altar pieces, especially the altar cloth, that are meant for worship of Nataraj. To me it feels sacrilegious. There are people that live and work in the temple that are really not happy with this disrespect. The person who\\u2019s leading it doesn\\u2019t seem to really have any awareness of culture or tradition. Then there\\u2019s a girl next to this person who\\u2019s in charge of the ceremony and she\\u2019s wearing all white. This, too, is not correct. People are looking back and forth at each other commenting on it, and then she sort of stumbles over her words. So her mother, a few people down, tells her to have everybody turn around to face outside of the circle and take their pants off because it would be easier if they did that - easier for her to remember her words. So she tells everyone to do this and they do. I am looking at this nun and she\\u2019s a Buddhist nun and she\\u2019s really delightful. She has short hair and robes. I can see her face because it\\u2019s reflected in a mirror and she\\u2019s making all these delightful expressions - looking at people around her, lifting up her eyebrows and opening up her mouth in a big happy smile, then going back into a serious face. She seems a little bit odd to me. Then suddenly the scene shifts. She\\u2019s still there, but she\\u2019s the size of a fairy or gnome and she\\u2019s standing in the grass. She\\u2019s still making these delightful expressions. There\\u2019s another small person with her. Then, somebody finds a journal and it\\u2019s my journal. The last entry is from December 31, 2019. I start to fill it in. I write the date next to it, January 1, 2020. I can\\u2019t remember exactly what happened, but I\\u2019m trying to fill in information or entries from that point on. Then another scene: there\\u2019s a little boy and he comes up to me and we\\u2019re not really connected right now. He wants to be in the bed. I don\\u2019t want him in the bed. Then I take this apple and he bashes his head onto the apple and then this apple turns into some kind of vessel with holes and slices and cutouts and what not. Pooled in the bottom of the apple is this red liquid, like blood. It\\u2019s an elixir of some sort. So I lift this apple to his lips and he drinks it. It does something to his consciousness. That\\u2019s all I remember.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, I am teaching a yoga class and I took it over from another teacher. At first the room is full of people, mat-to-mat. It is a chaotic energy. I start teaching. Then I turn away and look back. There is only a scattering of people. Most everyone has left and their mats are abandoned in a haphazard way, overlapping each other. It\\u2019s odd and doesn\\u2019t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don\\u2019t even teach savasana. As I\\u2019m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she\\u2019s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I\\u2019m amazed she hasn\\u2019t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She\\u2019s still not breathing. Then I wake up.\"],[\"I am walking on a sidewalk with my husband and see a pile of packages ready to be mailed. They\\u2019re addressed to our parents and from our friend Sherry. I think it\\u2019s such a nice gesture that she bought presents for our parents and we didn\\u2019t even think to. We see that one package is not fully wrapped. It\\u2019s a cake and waffles. We nibble the waffles and love them! We eat around the perimeter and hope it doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019ve been snacking on their gift. Then I\\u2019m with my husband and his family - dad, step-mom and step-sisters. We\\u2019re standing in a circle and they are passing around the beautiful cake that Sherry sent. They cut different sized slices and Krista takes an extra large slice - it\\u2019s so big there isn\\u2019t enough for everyone. Either I or my son grab the cake from her and start to eat. She\\u2019s upset, but the rest of the group says \\u201cno, they need cake, too.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful cake with orange frosting, different layers and textures. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in the same room, but it\\u2019s later in the day. I\\u2019m alone with my son. My husband\\u2019s dad walks in but he looks like a zombie, as if he\\u2019s been in a car accident. He\\u2019s completely bald and white pale and his face is streaming with blood. Then a younger version of my husband\\u2019s dad comes in with blood streaming down his face, too.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we\\u2019re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I\\u2019m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I\\u2019m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That\\u2019s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I\\u2019m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There\\u2019s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I\\u2019m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, \\u201cI was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.\\u201d She lists the women, but I don\\u2019t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it\\u2019s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don\\u2019t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It\\u2019s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He\\u2019s playing with the water from the fridge. He\\u2019s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I\\u2019m concerned that I don\\u2019t have anyone to take care of him and that he\\u2019s disturbing the session. But my client doesn\\u2019t seem to notice or care that he\\u2019s interfering.\"],[\"A store after hours. It\\u2019s been closed for a while now. People are gathering here at night, unlocking the door and huddling close inside. Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I\\u2019m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I\\u2019m not really welcome because I\\u2019m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won\\u2019t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I\\u2019m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving in a car with a group of people. One person is Thomas, a good friend from high school, who now is a designer in New York. We are driving past caged animals - wild animals - on both sides. We see elephants on both sides. On one side, the elephants are very calm and we comment on their parasympathetic nature and how unusual it seems in this confined space. The elephants on the other side look thin, agile and strong - there are mothers and calves. Someone who works there opens the gate to allow the animals to move from one side to the other across the road. A beautiful black gazelle leaps past us into a field. We get out of the car and follow the gazelle to see it up close. In the field, we come across two warthogs eating flowers. We\\u2019re close to them and someone remarks on how unusual it is to be this close without them charging at us. Then that seems to remind the warthogs of their nature. They lift their heads and start running after us. We run away as fast as we can. There\\u2019s a huge brown cow of elephant proportions so we have to run wide so she doesn\\u2019t kick us or knock us over with her long tail. Then I see my mom and dad riding a cow like a horse. My mom reaches down to catch my hand and pull me onto their cow. It nearly pulls her and my dad off the back of the cow. The cow is still running, but thankfully they are able to pull me up and we are able to escape. Then the scene shifts. I\\u2019m in Costco with my husband. We have an empty cart and we\\u2019re in the area where people eat pizza and hot dogs, but no one else is there. I see a sign with my husband\\u2019s full name on it. He\\u2019s been called for an appointment and now that he\\u2019s arrived and we\\u2019re done, they put the sign up higher on the wall to be reused. In another scene, I\\u2019m touring a house with my friend Kyle from high school. We\\u2019re in a big beautiful home with a lovely library filled with walls of books and reading nooks. Then I\\u2019m in a garage with a client from waking life. She\\u2019s talking with me about a few different magic shops in town that she knows about. There\\u2019s one called The Hidden Sword. She wonders how they\\u2019re doing and comments on how they invested in $2,000 in inventory to open.\"],[\"\\u201cA Seaworthy Vessel\\u201d I have built a big raft for the ocean with a group of about 5. There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there\\u2019s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It\\u2019s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I\\u2019m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I\\u2019m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don\\u2019t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They\\u2019re all great and I love them all. I\\u2019m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don\\u2019t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I\\u2019m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I\\u2019m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he\\u2019s pointing out. It\\u2019s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I\\u2019m in a shop. It is Jeremy\\u2019s shop. It\\u2019s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It\\u2019s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race. So we set a trajectory...\"],[\"I am at a Parks and Rec facility with a couple pools, workout rooms with stationary bikes and rooms upstairs for group classes. There\\u2019s a place on the farside of the pool where a man makes scones and homemade soaps and also sells produce. I get a job at the Rec Facility cleaning up. I\\u2019m at the side of the pool, pulling in the lane ropes out of the water and to the side of the pool. There are still people in the water. A man comes and is completely bald. He has a lot of vitality about him and is charming and warm. I can tell by the way he carries himself that he is a man of great wealth. He asks if he can help me and I tell him I don\\u2019t need help. I continue on with my work. He stays nearby, but is not lurking, just looking around. Then I go through the glass doors. There are bikes on display that are for sale. People have gathered to see a demonstration of a new bike. A man comes up from the crowd to help pull ropes and gears from under the ground to the stage to help demonstrate what this new bike can do. We\\u2019re all watching and waiting. This bike is expensive and the technology is quite advanced. The charming and beautiful bald man is standing next to me and after watching for a bit, he decides to buy a bike without knowing or asking the cost. I observe that he must be quite wealthy. Then, I am standing in line for my daily scone. He is with me and stands in line behind me. He is asking me about the scones, soap and produce. I tell him about how wonderful it all is. People pre-order scones, so they are guaranteed a scone each day, but there is a small selection of scones available. He steps up to the counter and orders 5 scones for both of us to share. The flavors are sophisticated, two pink ones with cardamom and peppercorn, two chocolate, and a plain one. The pink and chocolate scones are on a higher plate, and the icing drizzles down to the plain one. They look delicious. I\\u2019m looking through my credit cards, trying to find a specific one, but as I look, more cards seem to appear. I\\u2019m squinting at the cards because I can\\u2019t read them well. There are so many credit and debit cards, and I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with them. But he pays, so I put my cards away.\"],[\"I am at a teahouse - it reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco. I\\u2019m enjoying tea with a man and looking at his hands to see if he is wearing a wedding band. I have a memory of walking and talking with him and seeing a wedding ring. Now, his left ring finger is bare and his right ring finger has a silver band. Then I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walk in and am so disgusted. There is diarrhea all over the floor and big sticky gobs of shit everywhere - toilet seat and floor - and an especially disgusting yellow mucousy looking one dripping off the handicap bar. There is toilet paper strewn all over, too. I still have to pee. I end up getting shit on my hand. Then I\\u2019m trapped in this repeated portion of the dream, where I am trying to pull my pants up. I have one of my son\\u2019s diapers on and as I\\u2019m pulling the pants and diaper up, I keep smearing poop on the outside of the diaper\\u2019s right panel. It\\u2019s gross. I\\u2019m trying to repeat the scene in the dream to make the poop disappear, rather than deal with cleaning it up. I am in this bathroom with all this shit for a really long time. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m at a restaurant, sitting at a table all by myself. I\\u2019m looking out across the other tables and I see an acquaintance, Liz, and her husband. She is wearing a revealing black and red snake skin dress that displays her body and all her tattoos. She\\u2019s also wearing high red shoes. She\\u2019s flaunting her body. She\\u2019s looking back and forth at me and my husband. I see that my husband is sitting at a table near her. My husband is sitting with another person - this person is both the man I was enjoying tea with and a woman, somehow. Liz has a haughty look about her, assuming things aren\\u2019t going well with my husband because I\\u2019m sitting alone and my husband is enjoying the company of another person for dinner. Liz gets up and walks around to my husband\\u2019s table to say hello. All the while, her chin is lifted and she\\u2019s looking back and forth between my husband and me in this \\u201cknowing\\u201d way. It\\u2019s extremely uncomfortable. Her husband is also looking back and forth, more curious than haughty. The dream shifts again and I\\u2019m in a store. I have two massage tables set up near each other. I\\u2019m on probation and they\\u2019re deciding whether to imprison me or not. A man comes in - he\\u2019s the one who makes the decision. He lies down on one of the tables. Another woman who is also in charge is on the other table and the tables are actually right next to each other. We move the tables apart a bit. I massage his neck and head. He gets up to take care of some work. I tell him his scalenes and upper trapezius muscles were very tight, and I tell him what I did. Even though the work was good, they decide to imprison me. They lock me up in a room. At first I\\u2019m quiet but then after they leave, I bang on the door. The man from the tea house is there on the other side of the door. I ask him to help me, but he won\\u2019t.\"],[\"My mom is standing with her shins next to a child\\u2019s trampoline. In the middle of the trampoline is a pile of things that she is not aware of. She is looking around the room. I look down and see two snakes. At first I assume they are just plastic. They are both black, yellow and red. One is primarily yellow, the other is primarily red. Then I look more carefully and see they are alive. I stop for a moment and think this is impossible. But they are both stretching out towards my mom and one has its tongue out as if tasting the air around her leg. Then I realize they are alive and I urge my mom to stand back because these snakes are alive. She quickly moves back. Then, we realize it\\u2019s a test of some kind. One snake is poisonous and the other is not. Which one is poisonous? We are trying to remember by their markings. In another scene, I\\u2019m with Pema upstairs in my home (it shares some similarities with my current apartment, but not entirely). The banisters are overgrown with lavender, but it's growing as a vine. We are talking about family dynamics, particularly our parents\\u2019 dynamics. She tells me that her mom told her that her dad would never leave because it\\u2019s too complicated. Somehow, her saying this reassures me. Then someone comes and ties back the lavender with bungee cords to tame it and help guide its growth, so it doesn\\u2019t overcrowd the hallway. It looks more beautiful now. I\\u2019m upstairs for a while, then I notice new decorations on the wall - carved wood. I go downstairs and see it was some kind of Christmas day. My dad and my sister are sitting on the couch, and there\\u2019s a man with bright red hair sitting on the floor. They\\u2019re watching a movie on the projector screen. They have just opened presents. The guy asks my sister about the origin story of her daughter\\u2019s name. She starts to cry because it is such a poignant story. She says, \\u201cI wonder if I can just write it on paper? Then I wouldn\\u2019t cry so much.\\u201d The guy steps away to give her space. She starts to cry those soft tears of memory. We are all waiting for her to tell the story of her daughter\\u2019s name. In another scene I see two swans stepping into the water. One is grey and white, the other is mostly black with some white.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a lake cottage with my son. We are standing on the edge of the lake. We see a mama and baby swan, a rodent/marsupial mama and baby, and another mama and baby animal. He points out a small black bat struggling in the water. We are watching it as it splashes. He\\u2019s asking me about it: \\u201cIs that a bird, mama?\\u201d I tell him it\\u2019s a bat. I\\u2019m concerned it could have rabies. Other people and kids come by. They are climbing around the rocks. A woman holds my son and then gives him back to me saying he pooped in his diaper. I\\u2019m surprised because he\\u2019s potty trained. But I do see that her dress is soiled and so is his diaper. I take him away to change even though he wants to stay and play. We return to the cottage. I see Trina, a friend and former boss. She says, \\u201cOh, I need you to run an errand for me. I need you to carry my pet wombat to my other house.\\u201d I take this wombat with me on the trip and it is climbing all over me. It\\u2019s quite cuddly, cute and soft, like a baby. I arrive at her other house and see a lot of people. They are soaking in hot tubs by the lake. There isn\\u2019t a spot for me here. Then Trina\\u2019s husband wants to show me something. It\\u2019s a restaurant or storefront under construction. He wants my opinion about the flooring and decor.\"],[\"It\\u2019s a summer night. I\\u2019m doing work for Edward.. There\\u2019s a cottage with a garden. He sends me out with garden shears and a request to find five poles. I go out into the garden and I walk all the way out to the far end where there is a fence. I see five wooden poles lined up along the fence and pressed into the soil, standing up. I wonder if I\\u2019m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they\\u2019re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They\\u2019re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest. We\\u2019re all looking into the dirt. It\\u2019s a fascinating garden walk in the night. He finds a big snail with a grey-silver spiral shell. He taps lightly on the shell with a stick to show us. Then there\\u2019s something about talking cats. In another scene, I\\u2019m possibly in danger. It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m running, running, running. I\\u2019m dancing as part of a dance company. We\\u2019re rehearsing. I\\u2019m in the locker room getting ready to dance, but also scared to be found.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a conference with my husband. He is supposed to be presenting an emotional release, inter-relational class. He writes his name and the class title on a piece of paper at a particular time slot. We go back to our hotel room. In the next day or two, we show up at his class, but nobody is there. He is upset and is looking around, wondering what happened. A man comes out with the paper schedule and says, \\u201cHey, here is the schedule. You were scheduled to teach, but you aren't going to anymore. The class was bumped.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t empathetic and he just walks away. My husband is angry because he believes in the work and was really looking forward to teaching it. I\\u2019m somewhat relieved because I didn\\u2019t think many people would come - the conference isn\\u2019t well-organized and most people are going to classes run by people with big names, mostly yoga. I go back to the room. My husband goes to the pool to swim it off. Then I\\u2019m in the hotel room. It\\u2019s a penthouse suite. There\\u2019s something about curtains opening and closing, people coming in and going out. The scene changes and the guy who was in charge of the schedule is now an eye doctor working with two other doctors. I\\u2019m waiting for my turn - it\\u2019s a walk-in clinic. He turns out to be my doctor. I\\u2019m concerned because of how cold and unfeeling he was earlier. But now in this position, he\\u2019s kind and thorough and a very good doctor.\"],[\"I am in another personality, I'm not myself. It\\u2019s as if I\\u2019m living many days, months perhaps. There is a scene about a pink dress with white straps and a discussion about how it\\u2019s not a good dress for me, but it\\u2019s good if you\\u2019re more of a sporty type. There\\u2019s another scene on a beach, another in a house...just going through regular life.\"],[\"I am at the office, though it\\u2019s not exactly my office - it\\u2019s on a cliff looking out over the river, rather than level with the river. I\\u2019m with a group of kids looking out the window, waitng for a rocket launch. We look out and there is a man resting and relaxing on a blanket with a young woman. The man is an older African American guy with curly grey hair. I recognize him as a retired basketball player. I say, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s Lebron James or maybe it\\u2019s Micheal Jordan. He worked long and hard at his career and now he can just relax and enjoy the rest.\\u201d In another scene, I\\u2019m on a boat. There are big whales swimming around the boat. Then I\\u2019m in a restaurant, enjoying a meal with a male friend (one I don\\u2019t know from waking life). As we walk through the restaurant, we see people who we know. We stay until after hours.\"],[\"I am in Elizabeth\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the house I\\u2019ve always known since I was young. We\\u2019ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I\\u2019ve brought isn\\u2019t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, \\u201cSee how tall the ceiling is?! It\\u2019s always been this tall.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYes, so tall!\\u201d Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can\\u2019t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn\\u2019t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she\\u2019ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, \\u201cOh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I\\u2019ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.\\u201d She\\u2019s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I\\u2019m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day. When I go to her office this time, it\\u2019s different. There are walls around the office. She\\u2019s there, but the bears are not.\"],[\"My husband has just come home. As he was walking under a bridge, a woman slid her hand down his leg. He stopped and had sex with her. He comes back and tells me as if it were fine. I am livid. I get aggressive in my words and actions. I poke him really hard in the ribs and push him back. He is turning me into the person in the wrong. I am so angry that he would do this and act like it is okay because it happened under the bridge and she invited the encounter.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching as a group of people are training for combat. It seems to be a private army. Brad Pitt jumps into the courtyard. He confronts the leader. He says he wants to meet him in hand to hand combat. So the leader agrees. They begin this extreme demonstration of skill. Brad Pitt is wearing a big black trench coat and a mask. The guy tells him that he cannot let go while they are shaking. There\\u2019s an odd moment where the two men are in a firm grip, apparently shaking hands, but jaws clenched, muscles rigid, and sweating. All of a sudden, the leader whirls Brad Pitt across the courtyard. He hits a huge door, but then picks up a hose and sprays the leader down with high pressure. He is then accepted into the tribe.\"],[\"An extremely tall and thin Asian man in jeans is standing in front of a classroom of sorts. He has discovered his genetic profile. He\\u2019s with his girlfriend. He\\u2019s extremely upset because he has a particular gene that should give him an extremely high level of intelligence. However, he doesn\\u2019t judge himself as that intelligent, even though from the outside he definitely is. He\\u2019s pacing with so much agitation. Something shifts in him. He decides that he will kill himself, not only himself, but also his girlfriend. He\\u2019s going to kill anyone else who stands in their way.\"],[\"I am walking through the woods with a group of people. Tad is there in this group, too. He lingers towards the back and I slow down to linger with him. We walk closer together and brush shoulders and hands as we talk. He pulls me over and begins kissing me. It\\u2019s intoxicating. We make love in a clearing. Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There\\u2019s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I\\u2019m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there\\u2019s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I\\u2019ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I\\u2019ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend. My friend is at a bar and I tell them what\\u2019s going on. I laugh. Then I\\u2019m suddenly at the bar, outside. I can see stuffed animal penguins in the grass - one on its side and one on its feet, walking towards the water. There\\u2019s another moment with Tad - beautiful and romantic coming together that I wish I could remember better.\"],[\"The dream starts all over again. The second time around I am conscious that it is repeating and I\\u2019m getting a second chance. I recall how things ended and people died. I am changing how I engage in conversation based on what I know now and in hopes of changing the outcome. I am at a magical farm/garden home with my son. It belongs to Heather and is a dream place - I don\\u2019t know it from waking life. A brook runs through it with irises and other beautiful plants growing and blooming alongside. There is a lake, too. I see large willow trees that create sweet places to rest. I also see other trees, flowers and gardens with food growing. I am exploring the land with my son. Heather deadheads some flowers and gives my son a huge purple iris blossom. He carries it around for a while, then places it on a rock as an altar. There are natural and wild altars all around. Heather and her adult daughter live in a large tree that was once hollowed out by lightning. They have converted the inside into their home. They invite us in for tea. This is where the dream gives me an opportunity to change my responses. She is asking me questions about my husband and work and values. The second time around, I am able to respond more deeply and truly, moving past the initial superficial social awkwardness to what is meaningful.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a retreat - a weekend getaway with my husband and son. We\\u2019ve rented a house. I\\u2019m upstairs in the bathroom. My son is with me in the bathroom sitting at a table. I\\u2019m going to the bathroom, then realizing that my husband\\u2019s brother is there with me. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. I walk out without flushing the toilet. I also take off my shirt, but am again surprised that it\\u2019s not my husband who\\u2019s with me, but his brother. Then my husband comes home and goes up to the bathroom. He had been out. He looks into the toilet and is upset. I\\u2019m really embarrassed. Now I\\u2019m in an office building or a house - not mine or one I recognize. My friend is sitting on the kitchen counter. She looks at me as if she wants something from me. She wants to show me a picture she made. There is a window and a butterfly bush outside the window. Butterflies are flying around. My husband is standing there at the window and tells me how much he enjoys getting away for the weekend.\"],[\"This dream feels more complex than I can properly remember. It is of multiple realities and nothing is really. There is a hidden city within a city. There are sex workers and sex clubs hidden behind or within the matrix of a restaurant. People are being tracked on their cellphones. Places disappear and are forgotten, or only remembered as a dream, wondering if they ever existed, wondering if we ever actually visited these places, or if we were always in a dream the whole time. Others are trying to create or control the consensual reality.\"],[\"At the last minute, Burning Man is happening this year. It\\u2019s very low key, but still in the desert. You just arrive and buy tickets at $15/person. You can also purchase rooms for $10/night. I go with my husband. We park the car on the side of the road, then walk through rusted out picked apart cars and airplanes with a bunch of white men smoking and drinking beer. We see our friends Diane and Warren in line. Diane offers to buy our tickets. I think it\\u2019s so nice of her. I then wonder what we\\u2019re going to do about our sleeping situation. We didn\\u2019t bring sleeping pads or blankets, so we\\u2019ll be sleeping in the car through the cold night and just throwing clothes over us. Now I think we might be able to afford a night or so in the hotel because Diane bought our tickets. We are walking through the festival. It\\u2019s more like a regular festival with vendors rather than Burning Man\\u2019s creative form of energy exchange and generous artistic sharing. As we continue to walk, we end up on a concrete street with hotels and office buildings. My husband looks up into a window and it\\u2019s cracked by a bullet hole. There is blood splattered all over the window. We don\\u2019t know if it just happened or if it\\u2019s been there a long time. We also don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an artistic expression of some kind. We don\\u2019t know if or how or where to report it and we keep on walking. But I have a feeling someone is dead in the hotel bathtub up there. Diane looks at a building on our side of the street. She exclaims about the black and green obsidian architectural accents on the building and around the windows. She thinks it would be wonderful to live in such a place because of the protection afforded by this stone. I think it\\u2019s beautiful, too. I like the idea of living in a place like that. We keep on walking. Then we are at the exit point of the festival where we get food to go and catch a bus to go back to our car. We\\u2019ve done this a couple days already and have our favorite dishes. I have been picking up a noodle bowl with a friend of mine (who I don\\u2019t know from waking life). We\\u2019re either really early or really late. The guy who makes our noodle bowl sees us and he secretly makes our food. But he can\\u2019t give it to us yet. So I go to the front and my friend stays and waits for our food. I\\u2019m waiting for him. The food is delivered to him, but then he never returns to me. It is revealed to me that he was trying to find me, but he stepped out into the road and was run over and killed by a car. All that\\u2019s left of him is a small clump or rat hair and crushed rat bones in the gutter. I\\u2019m concerned but not very upset. It seems more strange than awful. Then my stomach is not feeling up to eating, but I know I need to eat. I stand in line at a deli counter and ask if they serve hot sandwiches. They hand me a menu and I\\u2019m also trying to squint at and read the menu on the wall. I can\\u2019t read either, but they tell me they don\\u2019t make hot sandwiches for dinner but not now, so I go on. I go to the back where there is a bakery. I stand at the counter and no one else is there. The baker and owner of the bakery comes out from the back. He loves everything about baking. He\\u2019s telling me about all the ethnic baking styles he does. I say I want something warm and hot. He asks me what I like. I say I like hot. He asks me what kind of hot and I say \\u201cspicy.\\u201d He asks me what kind of spicy and I say \\u201cwarm spicy.\\u201d I\\u2019m not giving him a clear idea of what I like. He shows me a tray of baked goods and invites me to try it. I love it. I\\u2019m sitting on the side nibbling on this savory dish. Then a big group of people arrives and they start looking at all the sweet dishes. One person comes and sits next to me and eats their dish. I go up to the front and see they have a tray of sugar glazed sticky buns in the shape of mice. They tell me these are covered with raspberry sauce and filled with blueberry cream. So I take one and they ring me up at the register. They tell me it\\u2019s $12. I\\u2019m surprised that one pastry would cost so much. I tell them I already paid for the savory treat. They don\\u2019t really believe me, but then the owner comes out and tells them I did pay, so I only owe a few bucks. I feel nourished and I feel good about this exchange.\"],[\"I am teaching a yoga class. I\\u2019m subbing for my friend. It\\u2019s like I just pop up out of bed and there I am in the yoga studio. So I\\u2019m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it\\u2019s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don\\u2019t know who they are or where we are or what I\\u2019m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it\\u2019s just so odd. So I\\u2019m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren\\u2019t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I\\u2019m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can\\u2019t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it\\u2019s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn\\u2019t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It\\u2019s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I\\u2019m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can\\u2019t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I\\u2019ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. It has the feeling of Burning Man in that there are people normally dressed and others wildly dressed, some are drinking and others are sober, some are on stronger drugs. We have come up with a new drug that doesn\\u2019t have a name yet. It\\u2019s like a combination of Molly and something else. There is a very artistic creative guy dancing and frolicking around. He comes outside and he takes a piece of paper that he\\u2019s drawn and written on, and he posts it high on a tree. He\\u2019s tall and he can reach this high. Someone gets it down and reads the paper. They say, \\u201cOh my gosh, this is the name of the drug. It\\u2019s Meggy. It\\u2019s a combination of Molly and Peggy.\\u201d The party dissipates a bit. I go home with my husband. We go upstairs. This is not a home I recognize from waking life. We decide to take our dose of Meggy. We know it takes a while to begin. We wander around. I get a book and start to read. I notice my vision starting to change - my right eye that in waking life is already damaged, starts to get really puffy and slotty so I can\\u2019t see well, and my other eye starts to change as well. I feel like it\\u2019s starting to set in. Someone comes and knocks on the door. We let him in and he says, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d So we all get in the car. There are cars filling up with other people. I see a blue car that was earlier in the day quite nice, but now it\\u2019s beat up a bit and covered in mud. We\\u2019re all trying really hard to get out fast, so something is going on. We arrive at a rundown hotel. One of the girls steps in and she\\u2019s trying to talk to the concierge. I\\u2019m watching her from a different perspective - as if from behind the concierge\\u2019s head. I\\u2019m looking her up and down. She\\u2019s dressed as a very prim and proper lady, all in white with white pumps. But she has dark black circles under her eyes and she\\u2019s really pale. She doesn\\u2019t look quite right. All of us have taken Meggy. Then there is violence. The woman transforms into a wild animal and kills him. The guy in charge of the whole operation has turned into a grizzly bear. I turn into a wild cat. Everyone is turning into wild predators. There\\u2019s a graphic scene in the elevator where I bat somebody\\u2019s head off. There\\u2019s guts and brain matter everywhere. All the animals congregate because we have to get together and get out. We all transform into somewhat human form and get out. A lot of time passes. I\\u2019ve separated out from the group and am trying to live a normal human life. I\\u2019m driving in my car down a country road. I end up at a farm. I see the guy who was in charge. Something has shifted in him and there is peace in him. He welcomes me. He takes me on a tour of the farm and introduces me to the people who live there. It\\u2019s an orphanage. There are some people who were originally part of the Meggy group. The effects of the drug have changed. Now they use it only occasionally to spark creativity or connection to each other and the Earth. They\\u2019ve created a completely self-sustainable farm, growing vegetables and fruit, milking goats and cows, raising chickens...they have found a way to make peace with themselves and the Earth. They take care of the Earth and the Earth takes care of them by providing food, shelter and home.\"],[\"There were a lot of New Year\\u2019s parties. Many of them were in conference rooms in the same hotel. They were for different echelons of society. You had to have personal invitations to some of the more exclusive parties. People were also going out of the hotel to other parties that required invitations and secret directions. It\\u2019s really crowded and not entertaining. I mostly just wander from party to party and room to room, feeling a bit awkward as people do at parties. I decide to go home at the end of the night. Before I leave, I see some chalk drawing on the ground and people are on their knees drawing. I wake the next morning and start baking. There are cupcakes and a couple cakes in the oven. I\\u2019m making a big round loaf of puffy poppyseed bread. Someone comes and knocks on the door urgently telling me that I have to come right now. So there are only 7 minutes left on the timer, but I have to go. I tell my dad the instructions really quickly. As I\\u2019m pulling on my shoes and coat, I realize I am starving and haven\\u2019t had any breakfast. I pull the bread out and tear off a piece, but this deflates the bread. It won\\u2019t be very good now and it\\u2019s still a bit wet and gooey on the inside. I put it back in the oven and tell my dad to take everything out in 5 minutes. I run off and follow my friend. We are running past houses and it\\u2019s really early, still dark. We run towards the harbor. I see a huge bird flying, but it looks more like a crawfish or koi fish with black feathers. There are other birds and dolphins and whales in the water. I wonder what this portends.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark and crowded. I\\u2019m running away and trying to escape before Ursula finds me. She\\u2019s looking for me in the crowds. I can tell she wants to harm me. There is a conference and gathering of people dressed in futuristic clothes, all in black with coats. Somebody lets me borrow their big puffy black coat to help hide me. I put this on. There is a row of people who tell me I can blend in with their group. I think it will be a solution to sit in that row with them. Before the conference starts, I go to the bathroom. Ursula and Gemma walk in right behind me. They don\\u2019t see me and I slip into a stall. But Ursula steps into the stall next to me, to my right. Gemma continues to wait in line and I don\\u2019t know how to escape without her seeing me. I think I wait until they both use the other stall because there are only two stalls. I think it\\u2019s safe so I go out, but they are washing their hands. Gemma sees me, though. I join the row of people who told me I could hide with them, but Ursula spots me. I escape the conference center in my big puffy black coat. I go down the street to a small house where I see a boy digging in the dirt with a shovel and pale. His mom is standing on the porch. She offers to help hide me.\"],[\"My son and I are on a sidewalk. We stop at a little square of a dirt where a tree was removed. There is a hole where the tree was. Jack comes by with a red wagon or stroller. My son really likes him. They\\u2019re talking and playing and having a good time. Jack invites us to his house to play with his kids. So we go over and my son is in the playroom with him and his kids. Jack\\u2019s wife joins me in the kitchen. She brings an armful of dresses because I need a dress for the evening. She says that she feels like she\\u2019s already met me and I feel the same way. We look a lot alike and we are the same size. We have other things in common, too. She\\u2019s showing me the dresses and encouraging me to try them on for the dinner tonight. We\\u2019re having a good time. It\\u2019s time to go and I gather up my son.\"],[\"I go to an address to find a new dress for Trina, my former boss. I\\u2019ve never been here before. When I walk in, my jaw drops in amazement. It\\u2019s a huge barn that has been converted into a boutique with gorgeous gowns hanging up on the walls all the way up to the ceiling. I\\u2019m looking for a particular style because the other dress was torn. It\\u2019s like an art gallery. I find a similar dress but with more vibrant colors. I ask for help getting it down. The woman who works here is thin and old with dry wrinkled skin. Her eyes are very bright and alive. She seems to know something I don\\u2019t know yet. Then she tells me that they have a dream group that meets here every other Tuesday. The man who leads this dream group is so eccentric and people really love him and adore him. I\\u2019m a little interested but also wary and doubtful of a man with such charisma and appeal. Then I\\u2019m walking down a hall in this big barn which I now realize is a retreat center. I see a sandwich board with an announcement for this dream workshop which happens to be this day later this evening. I then encounter this beautiful man in the hallway and there is something so magnetizing between the two of us. We are immediately drawn together and he\\u2019s pressing me against the wall. We are having an ecstatic sexual encounter, even though I\\u2019ve never seen him before. Then we smoothe down our clothes and go our individual ways. The old woman from the art dress show has arranged for me to have dinner with this dream teacher. So I go and am surprised to see the elegant dining room within the barn. I\\u2019m sitting at a table by myself. I order some food and this woman comes by. I\\u2019m loving my food - bread with oil for dipping. The woman pulls the bread out of my hand and starts to eat. I\\u2019m fighting her for it and think it\\u2019s so beyond that she\\u2019s decided to come up and eat my food! We\\u2019re having a fight about it and she just doesn\\u2019t understand. She wants to sue me not letting her eat my own food. Then the dream teacher\\u2019s assistant sits at the other side - I don\\u2019t know if they are a man or woman. The man from the hallway comes and sits directly across from me and gives me this smile. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that man in the hallway was this dream teacher.\\u201d I feel a bit awkward and don\\u2019t know what to say. He\\u2019s smiling at me in a knowing kind of laughing way and is enjoying my little shock. He introduces himself as if meeting me for the first time. I play along. His assistant kind of knows what\\u2019s going on. They order the food for the whole table and seem to know the menu well. The food arrives - noodles, lobster, buttery decadent amazing melt in your mouth meal with the most exquisite wine. My senses are turned on to full ecstasy. We begin talking about dreams. I end up going to the dream group and I can feel why people love him. My whole self is turned on again. I go every week. It seems like every other week we have this amazing sexual experience together and the other weeks he\\u2019s just focused on teaching and being there for all the students. I accept that this is the education and experience. Our relationship is amazing. There are no emotional obligations or expectations. Each class, the chairs are adjusted. In the last part of the dream, I remember a woman sitting in front of me. She\\u2019s a younger woman and hasn\\u2019t had any children, so her body hasn\\u2019t been stretched and it\\u2019s still in a bouncy young shape. She\\u2019s wearing a teeny tiny zebra print bikini bottoms. She\\u2019s leaning over in a provocative way then arching her back across the back of the chair revealing her beautiful sexy body and trying to catch his attention. I feel unhappy and insecure. My friend sitting next to me tells me, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it. He\\u2019s completely yours, through and through.\\u201d\"],[\"I am in the back of a building. There\\u2019s a man who really loves me. We\\u2019re wanting to be together, Then I am with this man and a group of priestesses building an altar. Gwen, Erin and Kem are there. Ursula is conspicuously not there. We put items on the altar, each of us contributing to different altars. The image that is most clear to me is a pile of tarot cards spread across the table, a picture of red shoes and an actual pair of red satin pointe shoes at the center of the altar.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a conference. I look across the way and see a yoga studio. The studio is struggling to keep its doors open. I see what looks to be an image of Ana Forrest, an international yoga teacher. She\\u2019s doing padangusthasana. As I look, I realize, it\\u2019s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it\\u2019s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it\\u2019s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don\\u2019t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she\\u2019s participating in to raise funds for the school. She\\u2019s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn\\u2019t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.\"],[\"There was so much to this dream but I\\u2019ve forgotten most of it. It felt important. People have made sand sculptures. Three people have made turtles. Two were too round. The third one is life-like. I see it with sand roses, then I see it lined with blue beer cans. Then I see it standing on its back fins on top of one of the other turtles. It is waving its fins in the air and saying: \\u201cThis is how a turtle is supposed to look. See how flat I am?\\u201d\"],[\"I am a black woman. They are doing my makeup - my eyebrows are in the wrong place. They draw them lower and do my eyes with thick eyeliner, shadow and mascara. They then start to put foundation on my face - it\\u2019s much lighter than my skin tone. They are covering up my natural brows and the rest of my face in a very thick application. I look in the mirror and do like what I see, but am concerned about how I\\u2019ll look when the makeup fades during the day and after I wash my face at night. Now, we are entering New York City through a portal. We are taken through a series of halls and rooms, peering in through glass windows. I am taken to a room with a large bed. The man who lives here is very wealthy and eccentric. He has strange sexual tastes and there is an understanding that we all must participate in some way to get out of here and continue on our journey. Now I'm in a basement or garage with a team. We need to find clues; each clue leads to the next. We\\u2019re doing well, but someone has tampered with the room and one of the clues in the sequence is missing. The floor is grey cement. There are shelves of books and odds and ends. There are other odd contraptions throughout the space. It\\u2019s dark with just a dim garage light. I\\u2019m now going to a performance in a theater. My husband and I don\\u2019t have tickets. When we arrive, they show us to our box seats. I see a friend from town and her husband. Their son is just a few days older than my son. We are taken to the seats front and center - very conspicuous. Now, I am in the portal rooms again. The man is in bed under the covers with at least three other people. I am standing at the side of the bed and ask him about the mattress composition. He says it\\u2019s made of wormwood. Interesting. There are beads of creamy substance in the seams. I pick them up and roll them into a ball and think it\\u2019s some kind of glue leaking through. I show it to him and ask him what it is. He pops it in his mouth, eats it and gives me a look. He laughs at my naivety.\"],[\"There\\u2019s an awkward dream with a former friend, Liz. It\\u2019s like Edward and I have given her an itemized receipt or invoice for her to review and pay. She\\u2019s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There\\u2019s another dream where we\\u2019re looking at a house. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull. In another dream scene, I go into a bakery through the side door where baking scientists are discussing plans for the day. I\\u2019m not sure whether to leave or stay and ask my question. I don\\u2019t feel particularly welcome in this food laboratory.\"],[\"Someone is knocking on our door. We were expecting visitors, so I\\u2019m not surprised. The knock feels threatening, though. Someone goes to look through the peephole and sees a threatening looking man - big and rough, a local Hawaiian guy. There\\u2019s a whole busload of big, rough guys. I also see Tan France from the \\u201cQueer Eye\\u201d show. We realize that if we stay here, our lives will be in danger. We don\\u2019t open the door and we don\\u2019t let them in, but they know we\\u2019re inside. Eventually they give up for now and drive away. We know that if we stay, it could be a problem. We pack up and bring our plant starters in the RV. We drive a bit and are supposed to rendezvous with someone with a mask to buy and bring to my brother-in-law. We park the RV in a field for the night. A big truck comes driving towards us really fast and stops just in front of us. We\\u2019re afraid it might keep going and run into us. Someone knocks on our door, but we don\\u2019t want to open the door because we don\\u2019t know who they are or what they could bring with them. They end up opening the door themselves. I see a couple Latina girls. We know their family and realize these are the people who we are supposed to meet up with. The mom and dad come in and we\\u2019re concerned that all these people are in a small space. She shows us this mask - it\\u2019s like a Gonzo mask, rubber and blue with a bulbous nose - one of her creations. She shows us how to wear it - she puts it over her nose and then says, \\u201cWhen I take it off, I just pull it down over my waist like this.\\u201d I don\\u2019t think she realizes how this looks like a strap-on.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying at a big house. I\\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment with a woman who reminds me of Geri (a friend who worked for Burning Man and who I camped with a couple times) for 11am the next day. There are a lot of people here. I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It\\u2019s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn\\u2019t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I\\u2019m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She\\u2019s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can\\u2019t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I\\u2019m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I\\u2019m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren\\u2019t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day\\u2019s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I\\u2019m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I\\u2019m waiting at the couches - I\\u2019ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I\\u2019m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it\\u2019s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I\\u2019m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I\\u2019m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I\\u2019m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn\\u2019t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don\\u2019t want to do it anymore and I\\u2019m not going to come back. She says, \\u201cWell, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle. This is not something you give up so quickly.\\u201d I doubt myself and wonder if this is a good idea even though it doesn\\u2019t feel right or fitting. I agree to come back one more time to give it another chance.\"],[\"This is the last part of the dream: I\\u2019m with a group of people in a tropical place. There\\u2019s red dirt like Hawaii, or maybe Costa Rica. My husband along with a couple (our friends and both yoga teachers), and a few others. We\\u2019ve been looking at houses. We come to this piece of land. Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We\\u2019re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they\\u2019re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They\\u2019re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we\\u2019re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings. I see people making the paper boats with bits of paper they found in the trash. There\\u2019s also some kind of healing going on.\"],[\"I wake up from a nightmare screaming for the police.\"],[\"A dinner event. A wild animal runs through, injured. I chase after this animal. There are other wild animals running with me. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll blend in with them and they will not notice I\\u2019m human, but animal like them. We\\u2019ll run together and catch up with the injured one ahead. A man who runs with these animals has joined us and is running just behind me down the path. One of the animals falls but is able to get up and continue. Scene change. A group of people gather on a rooftop. They are making a temporary home each night on this roof, setting up tents, cooking food. A man who used to live in his van at the river is there. He now has a truck and it doesn\\u2019t appear that he lives in the truck, so I think he\\u2019s bought a house. But he is traveling with us. Every night we set everything up then take everything down in the morning. We go on a journey during the day, taking the truck. We pull out all our kitchen and sleeping supplies at night. One night, a woman takes out a fancy grill - so much nicer and easier to use than the one we\\u2019ve been using because there is no need to hook up propane. You just push a button for the heat and another button for the water. I feel a little ashamed of my smaller one, but realize mine serves a purpose because it is smaller and more easily transported.\"],[\"I find out from Gail that the ladies didn\\u2019t really want to start meeting again with me. But they were humoring me. It feels really uncomfortable. I find this out while sitting with Gail at a small particle board table that has been painted and carved to look nicer. Gail\\u2019s oldest daughter is picking at the table and ruining it. Gai\\u2019s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She\\u2019s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks. She looks so beautiful and I\\u2019m envious, but know I couldn\\u2019t wear either of those outfits because I\\u2019m not tall and thin. Irene is going to meet her lover. Then she ends up going to the second story. Katy is there and they are having a wonderful deep engaging conversation. Again, I\\u2019m feeling left out as if I don\\u2019t belong and have nothing of value to contribute. On a floor above is a barber shop. My dad is getting his hair cut. My mom is there, too. Then somehow this barber shop is in another building - a hospital. Ted tells me he\\u2019s been enjoying talking to and seeing my parents on the floor just above where he works. I\\u2019m happy to see Ted and talk with him. My mom and I then go out to dinner. We\\u2019re sitting in a dark restaurant and a man is sitting with us. He feels a bit creepy. The waiter comes by and has a thick Irish accent. I order fries and then my mom orders. Then the waiter and the man start talking with each other in Gaelic. I\\u2019m wanting to interrupt so I can speak and learn the language again. The guy at my table is reading a poem. I ask if the word means garter as I make a motion of pulling a garter up over my leg. They look at me and laugh as if humoring me. They are laughing as if it was some sort of sexual innuendo that I didn\\u2019t catch. The waiter disappears and doesn\\u2019t return to our table. He has to declare bankruptcy but is being hunted down for money he owes. I find him in a crowded cafe with multiple serving stations. He\\u2019s making eggs with parmesan cheese to serve and judged. If he gets the cooking job, he\\u2019ll be able to pay his bills. I join him at the stove and help plate the eggs. I see a pile of powdered sugar on the plate, but think it should be on the dessert plate instead. His girlfriend is also helping. I scoop up the powdered sugar but don\\u2019t have a place for it while she plops savory sauce on the plate. It\\u2019s messy but it tastes good. I think it tastes so good that the appearance won\\u2019t matter.\"],[\"An old building made of stone with old fixtures. It\\u2019s two maybe three stories with big wide stairs. I\\u2019m walking up to the second floor. There\\u2019s something about water, learning about the power and magic of water. There\\u2019s a feeling of conflict, misunderstanding, fear, manipulation, and yet an attempt at forming a common goal - a goal of learning then teaching. The power goes out in the building. Then, we\\u2019re in the hallway sweeping up dirt and hair that has fallen off people\\u2019s heads over the years. In another room, a class is beginning. Someone hands me an amulet of lava stone with red jewels and hammered iron. I wear it during the class. The class is a movement almost like yoga. I wear the amulet to charge it with power. I\\u2019m given two other amulets to wear and keep with me and charge up as well.\"],[\"I am touring a large apartment building. Units are being made available as people move. Some are moving out completely, others are moving for a better view. When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I\\u2019m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we\\u2019ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That\\u2019s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I\\u2019d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There\\u2019s a sign about reservations required. It\\u2019s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It\\u2019s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I\\u2019m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don\\u2019t want to pay because there\\u2019s only fifteen minutes left. I\\u2019m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn\\u2019t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we\\u2019re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It\\u2019s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I\\u2019m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there\\u2019s no place for me to sit. I\\u2019m watching my son to see if he\\u2019s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t find my husband. I\\u2019m at some kind of party at a country club or public pool. First I get a video call from my mom and sister. She\\u2019s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She\\u2019s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I\\u2019m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I\\u2019m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he\\u2019s actually swimming. He\\u2019s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I\\u2019m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can\\u2019t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I\\u2019m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he\\u2019s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I\\u2019m so mad at him. And he\\u2019s just shrugging me off. He tells me that he\\u2019s been doing other stuff, too, and not telling me about it: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been drinking six cups of coffee a day, drinking beer everyday, getting high everyday and smoking cigarettes again. I\\u2019ve been hiding from you the whole time because I know how upset you get.\\u201d I\\u2019m so mad that I want to beat him up. The woman comes back. She\\u2019s watching and smoking. She has tattoos all over her body and they aren\\u2019t well done or tastefully designed. She lifts up her shirt to show her belly. I can see she is very far along. The baby is lying sideways which isn\\u2019t good. I\\u2019m continuing to get more mad. She asks him where to send the invoice for the cigarettes. He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It\\u2019s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It\\u2019s \\u201cWhyNotHard\\u201d or \\u201cWhyNot&Hard\\u201d or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. I\\u2019m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he\\u2019s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we\\u2019re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together. One of them starts to sing and tells me she\\u2019s been watching and listening to the whole drama. She\\u2019s laughing because she\\u2019s been there before. They are all singing a song and the scene shifts. It\\u2019s like we are in a music video. We are standing under trees by a body of water. There are brown leaves covering the ground. I see an ice blue woman naked and lying partially hidden under the leaves. I wonder if she is me. I can\\u2019t recall what happens next. But then I am trying to teach a yoga class to a group of people who are wanting really advanced trick poses. I can do and teach these poses but I want to slowly warm them up and prepare them to do it safely. But, nobody is really paying attention. They have this better than thou attitude that turns me off. I don't want to continue teaching to people who are so disrespectful.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house or residential school. I\\u2019m taking my examinations - writing, math and dance. Eac person has their own private space to write. I go outside to the yard with my blue books and find a stone grotto to sit in. it\\u2019s dark outside, night. After I finish writing, I go back inside for the dance examination. This is a small performance based audition. I enter into the audition late and displace another woman who was until now guaranteed a spot in the school. Afterward, people begin talking about my skill and wondering where I learned to dance like that. I walk into another room where they keep the wild leopards. There is a pool with rocks along the side and some trees - an attempt to replicate a watering hole in their natural environment. I see a huge one - a paleolithic version of the leopard. This one is standing on a rock in the water. A younger adolescent leopard is lying splayed out on the beach, mouth open wide and teeth showing - it reminds me of a skinned lion rug I\\u2019ve seen before in waking life. There\\u2019s also a paleolithic leopard kitten crawling around the rocks. I'm surprised to see these wild animals inside a concrete room without windows. I go to another room that is a workroom with tools, like a woodwork or metal shop.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m downtown in an urban environment that I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It\\u2019s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There\\u2019s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I\\u2019m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn\\u2019t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it\\u2019s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn\\u2019t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren\\u2019t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a car. We are driving down a slippery wet road at night. My son is in the backseat with a man. My husband is driving and I\\u2019m in the passenger seat. We\\u2019re leaving the house for an errand. A family has moved into our apartment with us and has brought all their kitchen supplies including a large cast iron pan, a whole collection of knives, spatulas, spoons and other things. Before we left, I was making an egg on a pan with a non-stick surface. Whenever I stepped out of the kitchen, the mom came and moved my egg to the cast iron. I moved it back and she moved it again. It was really irritating and I wanted them out. I couldn\\u2019t imagine blending our households. So I left. We are dropping off her husband so he can pick up more things. He\\u2019s aware of her controlling ways in the household and especially in the kitchen. He\\u2019s silent and apologetic in his silence. We drop him off at a house in another neighborhood. Then my husband drops me off at a gym for a class. Other women are sitting on the street waiting for them to open. I lean my chiropractic table against a garage door. Behind the garage door are supplies for the dance and exercise classes. I can see numbers that tally the equipment to help keep track of it all when people use them for classes and return them later. A woman comes to sit beside me. She recognizes me and offers me a drink from her flask. I take it then the teacher comes and opens the doors. We all go inside and are all tipsy. The class begins but it is disorganized. It\\u2019s kind of like an adult gymnastics class and it feels like a gym I used to go to when I was younger - balance beams, parallel bars, tumbling floor and vault. A woman who identifies herself as Tiffany (I don\\u2019t know her from waking life) invites me to her family\\u2019s home after class. I go with her. Her aunt is sitting in the backseat and we are going to visit her mom, Norma.\"],[\"This dream is remembered mostly backwards. The last scene of the dream I look down at my phone and it\\u2019s lit up with Jeremy\\u2019s name. He\\u2019s calling. I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it\\u2019s him even though he\\u2019s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I\\u2019m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it\\u2019s not a video call, I can see him. He\\u2019s sitting on an oversized chair. He\\u2019s very awkward. He says, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s Jeremy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI know. Hi, how are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to be light. Then he says, \\u201cI owe you an explanation.\\u201d So then he starts to share. I can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I\\u2019m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It\\u2019s urgent. I\\u2019m running through snow. It\\u2019s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We\\u2019re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It\\u2019s a big pool and I\\u2019m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn\\u2019t notice that the water has been draining until it\\u2019s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I\\u2019m at dinner. It\\u2019s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.\"],[\"I am watching a mom I know from town. Her daughter is about the same age as my son. In waking life, she has always been discontent with being a mother. I\\u2019ve tried to not judge her way of complaining about her daughter being a distraction to her art, because it so far of how I perceive motherhood. She has made a deal for her birthday that the time with her daughter will be front loaded to this time of life, so she can get it over with. Somehow, her daughter will grow older faster, while the mom ages at the same rate. So time is expanded in some way. It\\u2019s unusual to watch. Now I\\u2019m in an airplane and my brother in law is flying it. I\\u2019m grateful for his skill - he flies helicopters in waking life. He\\u2019s taking off and we\\u2019re gaining momentum, though not climbing high into the air as quickly as I expected. He\\u2019s staying low to the ground and identifying men who he knows as officers in the military. He flies directly over their head - the sergeant, the colonel and the captain. We are escaping. We have to get out because a war is coming.\"],[\"I am hiding out with my husband at the border of Oregon and California. We are on the Oregon side in some bushes. We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We\\u2019ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we\\u2019ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn\\u2019t have to smear the lotion in the dog\\u2019s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they\\u2019re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They\\u2019ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I\\u2019m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I\\u2019m thinking that maybe he\\u2019ll drive because he isn\\u2019t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river. He has found a stick and a net on a long pole, like a pool skimmer. It\\u2019s broken around the edges and the net is slightly torn. A couple comes by with their dog on a leash. They let the dog off leash and the dog jumps in the water where my son was pretending to fish with his net. My son just stands and watches at first. But then he wants to try to fish for the dog. I tell him not to. There\\u2019s a little back and forth between us. I then tell my son that we will have to go to another part of the river or I\\u2019ll take away the net. I\\u2019d rather the people just leave with their dog instead of continuing to throw the stick into the water for the dog to fetch. Eventually I get my son to draw back and watch until they decide to leave.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a boat. I\\u2019m with my husband and son and somebody else, a captain who is directing the boat. There are other boats in the water. We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I\\u2019m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he\\u2019s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I\\u2019m looking around and notice it\\u2019s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I\\u2019m looking through the papers and see that there\\u2019s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I\\u2019m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He\\u2019s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It\\u2019s really rough and she hasn\\u2019t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It\\u2019s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I\\u2019m at a celebration for Ted, an award\\u2019s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I\\u2019m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there. His dad, who is dead in waking life, is there and drinking a huge glass mug of whisky and ice. His mom and I are sipping nicer whisky that I had brought. I make eye contact with him, smile and nod my head in congratulations for his accomplishments.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with a woman who reminds me of a combination of Jules and CeeCee - a thin bony woman. We\\u2019ve snuck into the hotel room. Someone else was here earlier and left their computer. They were doing research on a man and following a track of blood and other clues. I\\u2019m getting ready for bed but not feeling entirely comfortable. There are two beds. She seems a little wired. In the bathroom there is blood in the toilet and toilet paper. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s my blood or hers. The beds are set up with a lot of pillows. The blankets are on the ground. She pulls the blinds closed and the curtains are still open. The blinds are moving from just being closed. She was on the computer and downloaded the search history and printed it out. She hasn\\u2019t looked at the papers yet, but she will do that tomorrow. I\\u2019m in my bed now. She\\u2019s in hers. I feel her reaching over to me and I feel really uncomfortable. I\\u2019m not feeling safe enough to fall asleep. Tomorrow is Easter.\"],[\"All the women have gathered for my friend Talia\\u2019s birth. We\\u2019re inside a large room. She\\u2019s standing up higher and radiant in her pregnant fullness. She starts to feel labor beginning. We\\u2019re watching and singing and holding space. At one point, she\\u2019s in a smaller room. I hear her say that she pooped and a woman says, \\u201cgood, this is great, this is part of it.\\u201d Then another woman who sounds like my mother shames her for pooping. She says it\\u2019s not a good thing. I wish I was there to be another voice of support. She comes out of that room, clean and very much in the fire of crowning birth. I can see a redness and opening between her legs. She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We\\u2019re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She\\u2019s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby. I think I would not be happy if I were not the first to hold my baby. We all look and see that it is a healthy baby. We bring the baby back to Talia with love and devotion.\"],[\"Elevators going up and down. A mall. I\\u2019m with my childhood friend Elizabeth watching. People are wearing unusual clothes. Gwen is recording a podcast about inter-racial relationships. A group of us are gathered for the recording. The intro to the podcast is recorded by an Asian woman in a relationship with a black man. She is describing their relationship and it\\u2019s recorded like a guided meditation in a semi-darkened room. Then the lights turn on and Gwen is speaking about inter-racial relationships between white women and black men. I\\u2019m sitting beside her as support. The scene opens up and a white woman and black man are running. People are chasing and trying to track them down. They separate for safety and hope they can find each other again.\"],[\"Returning to the farm. Mexican laborers are all sleeping on the ground, passed out in sexual ecstasy, their pants down, all men. An investigation reveals that one man found a long crystal in the dirt and in secret stimulated himself until he orgasmed and fell asleep. Somehow the other men understood what happened and used the crystal, as well. Returning to the farm, a group of people are having their own experiences and judgments. There\\u2019s a beautiful ballerina with bright red lipstick. She is the object of attraction and desire, but she has none herself. So when she feels his attraction for her, she pretends sleep. She sees herself from the outside, her face pushed up with bright red lipstick smudged on her nose. She\\u2019d like to fix her face and make herself more beautiful in her sleep, but moving would betray that she was still awake. So she stays and she sees on her cheek the evidence of pimples and many breakouts when she was younger and wishes that away. But he stands over her and wishes for her warmth, wishes for connection. And they\\u2019re both alone in their thoughts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m waking up at a festival. I\\u2019m walking through to the ocean or bay. I see that some others are still sleeping and the beds are set up to be floating over the ocean with only a white gauze curtain around for a little privacy. I\\u2019m curious about it. I see my friend Maxine walking around in a huge hoop skirt. It looks like she\\u2019s wearing a long curly wig that goes all the way to the ground. Other people are dressed up in festival attire. I don\\u2019t think I am, but I can\\u2019t sense much about myself. There\\u2019s a water slide that people go down to splash in the water. I\\u2019m supposed to be covering Sophie\\u2019s shift. I don\\u2019t know whether it starts at 9 or 9:30, but I need to get there. But now it\\u2019s raining and grey, and I know I\\u2019m in San Francisco. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019ll get there and park and be on time. It\\u2019s more complicated than I thought it would be when I agreed to help. Now I realize it\\u2019s not a chiropractic shift, but I\\u2019m subbing a yoga or meditation class for her. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in another doctor\\u2019s office. It smells like cigarette smoke and really stuffy. All the other rooms are occupied and the doctor of physical therapist is running late. There isn\\u2019t enough room to teach a class and it won\\u2019t be worth my time or energy to do this, but I\\u2019ve committed. Then there\\u2019s a scene of my sister lying on her stomach and a prince speaking with her and evaluating whether she is a good choice for him or not.\"],[\"There is a land we must pass through. I\\u2019m with a big group of people. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them from waking life. We get to a point where the tigers are. We\\u2019re strategizing and learning how to get through. We\\u2019re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It\\u2019s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don\\u2019t have anyone to pair off with, so I\\u2019m going through the motions by myself. I\\u2019m also wary of holding people\\u2019s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don\\u2019t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I\\u2019ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don\\u2019t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I\\u2019m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I\\u2019m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties. I\\u2019m sad and disappointed, I feel left out because they haven\\u2019t thought to invite me. I would like to be included.\"],[\"Something about a family portrait and me reminding the young men and their father of their deceased mom/wife. We find out that they live just down the street. I live on 25th and they live on 36th. They are going back to their home to get the portrait to show me how my gestures mimic hers exactly.\"],[\"An empty boat. A journey over the ocean or maybe just a bay. Salt water. I\\u2019m watching a person who has never captained a boat. They are gathering a crew. I know the end of the story. The chosen captain doesn\\u2019t survive the journey. I\\u2019m watching to see how this happens, wondering if the captain is murdered or dies of natural causes or has an accident of some kind. The crew is assembled. The boat is beautiful but totally empty. We all get on the boat. As the people move up and down the different levels of the boat, I'm peering through windows. There are people carrying small lanterns to light their way, others writing in journals, others sleeping, others watching the stars. I\\u2019m waiting to see where the captain is going and what will happen to the captain. Maybe by watching, it may shift the way things develop. Maybe the captain will survive. But there is no way to know. Then, a bathtub with a little girl in the tub, prepubescent, learning about puberty. Hanna is in one room. Rose is in another room. Another woman is also present. Hanna is very light in her questioning. Rose is very certain in her teaching, talking about the first blood and how to measure a ship to be as clear as possible from the beginning. Do we measure from end to end, or only the livable portion of a ship? She\\u2019s talking about how to maintain and care for the pubic hair without having razor bumps. Rose says, \\u201cWell, of course you massage first for a while.\\u201d She says this as if everyone should know. I feel ashamed that I do not know and remind myself to remember when I wake up.\"],[\"I am walking through a downtown area. The streets are dark and wet. I\\u2019m looking for a hotel restaurant and spa. I find it and it\\u2019s larger and more elegant on the inside than it appears on the outside. I go to the concierge to make an appointment at the spa. They tell me to wait in the lobby and come back when they call my name. I look over the different treatment options on the spa menu. There are only women here - it\\u2019s a women only spa. I see Rose who I think is applying for a job here as a sexocological bodyworker and some other women I don\\u2019t recognize from waking life. After some time passes, they call me up to the desk. They give me a large ticket printed on brown cardstock. It has my name on the front and information for my first time. Then they give me my assigned therapist who will give me my treatment. They lead me to the back. I go down the stairs behind them. Instead of going directly to the spa, I go to the restaurant. It\\u2019s huge with tall ceilings. People are spaced out at different tables. I sit at my assigned table. A couple other people join me. I look at the menu and the food is unusual - fine dining breakfast/brunch. I order. The food arrives and it\\u2019s a crystallized strawberry fluff. It\\u2019s delicious. The person across from me is a chef and she\\u2019s talking about how she makes a strawberry ice cream. She gets the largest strawberries and cuts them in slices and places them together to make something like a boat. She makes the ice cream from scratch. The other person sitting next to me says, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s the most wonderful thing you\\u2019ve ever had!\\u201d She promises me an invitation to a dinner party at her home. I love the idea of going to a chef\\u2019s home for dinner. Meanwhile, the spa therapists are coming around and finding the people they recognize for their treatments - there are a lot of regulars here and I might be the only new person. I\\u2019m assigned to a person named Shannon. I think they are a woman. This person comes down and everyone knows and loves her. She is one of the most sought after therapists. She is being discreet, looking around for her client, not calling out names, because we are all supposed to be anonymous here. Then she starts singing a song about herself because we don\\u2019t recognize each other. Now I realize that she identifies as \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are tall, brown skin with big black hair, very lean and strong. I realize, \\u201cThis is Shannon.\\u201d I try to get their attention once they complete their song. Most of the others have gone to receive their treatment. I reach into my bag to get my ticket. I can\\u2019t find it at first and am concerned that I won\\u2019t be able to receive my session without it. It\\u2019s tucked in between notebooks and other papers. I take it out and show them my name and their name printed on the ticket. We go out and I don\\u2019t recall the treatment. Afterwards, I\\u2019m on a beach. My dad is sitting on a beach chair next to me. There\\u2019s another older man sitting next to him and some young adults in their late twenties sitting on a surfboard in front of us. My dad comments on one of the gals wearing a little bitty red one piece swimsuit. Her body is very young and firm. My dad talks to the old man next to him, assuming the young woman is this old man\\u2019s girlfriend. He tells the old man how lucky he is. I\\u2019m disgusted by the conversation between them. I get up and walk to the shore. I see small creatures digging holes in the sand after the waves go out. I dig a hole and am finding crawdads and am pulling them out while trying to avoid their claws. I look out at the ocean. The water is so clear. I see turtles and then this creature. At first I think the creature is another turtle, but when I look more closely, it\\u2019s like a dolphin with an elephant trunk. I point it out to people. We realize that the young woman who the men were talking about is the fiancee of the older man\\u2019s son. They all go inside a dive bar and are ordering drinks and cigars and talking about the plans for the rest of the night. It\\u2019s getting late and I\\u2019m wishing to be somewhere else.\"],[\"The university sessions are over and now we\\u2019re on break. I\\u2019m done with my classes and graduating. I don\\u2019t have a plan yet. Trina is running a house and she\\u2019d like me to help. It won\\u2019t be a real use of my skills, but it\\u2019s a great situation. She\\u2019ll pay me $4,518 a month to live in the house and to respond to calls and visitors. I will also have time to do some sessions. I\\u2019ll pay $505 a month for my room and board in the house. I\\u2019m sitting across the desk from her in her office. She has all the papers prepared with the tax calculations. I sign the papers and feel at ease. I can relax into this time with a steady monthly paycheck and a safe place to live that is run by people with integrity and enough money to be generous. In another scene, I\\u2019m standing in the rain outside Whole Foods. It\\u2019s dark. I\\u2019m with my mom and grandmother. It\\u2019s COVID times so we have to wait to get in. They let us in and we put our masks on. We can\\u2019t ask for help because people aren\\u2019t available in the aisle. We are looking for breadcrumbs. We separate and my grandmother finally finds the aisle with the breadcrumb choices. I was getting frustrated walking around and around the store. But my grandmother shows me options. There\\u2019s one with mushrooms, which I say no to because of my sister\\u2019s allergy. Another is made of potato chips and I think that could be interesting, so it\\u2019s a maybe. There\\u2019s another one with some other flavors in a big pink bag. None are exactly right, but I have to choose something and stand in line again to purchase it. In another scene, there is a group of men, mostly African American. They are setting up a nice area for themselves with a firepit, matching tables and chairs. They\\u2019ve created something beautiful. We are all sitting around outside in the dark around separate fire pits. Most of us are striving to get by and have mismatched sets of chairs and such.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Anya, Moira, Kel, and a new patient who I haven\\u2019t met yet. The office is down the street from a big house that is being used for multiple offices. I\\u2019m in the house. Anya and Kel are helping me set up the tables upstairs. People are arriving for sessions. A fire is lit in the fireplace. It\\u2019s dark and musty. There are quite a few massage and chiropractic tables folded in their traveling bags. There are tables and stacked chairs. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to set up the table for privacy and professionalism for my new patient, but it\\u2019s chaotic. This is a way for me to practice and for people to watch me work and potentially become patients.\"],[\"I can only remember two bits from an extensive dream. I\\u2019m walking down a city street. There are steps leading up to a second story restaurant. It\\u2019s an elegant cafe. I go up the stairs with my son. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I\\u2019m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we\\u2019ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I\\u2019ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he\\u2019s gone. He\\u2019s not on the stairs. I\\u2019m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s gone. In another scene, I\\u2019m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I\\u2019m at the baths. I\\u2019m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She\\u2019s watching the cat while the cat\\u2019s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I\\u2019m trying to pretend that I don\\u2019t know Ursula so that the woman doesn\\u2019t connect me with Ursula\\u2019s former apprentice.\"],[\"I accept Garth\\u2019s invitation to come and visit. He is staying in a multi level apartment building. I go by myself and knock on his door. His wife and daughter aren\\u2019t there, they just had a really big fight and his wife has left with their daughter. He invites me to sit down on the couch so I can do my work. I have my laptop. I sit on a fluffy green couch. He has all the ergonomic things and is handing me something to hold the computer and another thing to cancel the EMF and another thing to support my neck. He\\u2019s being attentive to me in all those ways. He invites me to put the computer down and sit next to him. I think about it for a while, then I do. He draws me closer to him. I pull back because I don\\u2019t want to betray her friendship. I want to open a conversation about their relationship to see if there's anything I can do to help mend the wounds. I know that cuddling him and giving him physical comfort wouldn\\u2019t be good for any of our relationships.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the bathroom with a couple other women. We are getting ready. They\\u2019re in and out of the shower. One woman is really fit and looks like she does yoga regularly. She is jumping up and down and dancing in the bathtub as she\\u2019s showering. She says she uses every opportunity to move her body. There\\u2019s something waiting outside the bathroom. It feels ritualistic and dark, involving blood, but I can\\u2019t recall anything more.\"],[\"Somehow I\\u2019m able to see the priestess message board and the communications that are occuring, written in gold filigree on a black background. I can see the names of the current priestesses and little gold fairies and the teachings being recorded here. I don\\u2019t know if they can tell I\\u2019m here observing. Ursula looks up as if she knows I\\u2019m here and I\\u2019m wondering if my name is appearing on the board as someone present and watching. The messages begin to disappear. The names are changed. I can\\u2019t understand them any longer. But I know one is her daughter and she is the \\u201cseanalair\\u201d or the \\u201cseantian.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a street, it\\u2019s dark and wet, like it\\u2019s been raining all day. It\\u2019s not currently raining. I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called \\u201cKali\\u2019s Eyes.\\u201d I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn\\u2019t functioning well and I can\\u2019t find what I\\u2019m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I\\u2019ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it\\u2019s really crowded. I\\u2019m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they\\u2019ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can\\u2019t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I\\u2019m frustrated. It\\u2019s also still COVID, so it\\u2019s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that\\u2019s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I\\u2019d like to sit on, but they\\u2019ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it\\u2019s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It\\u2019s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They\\u2019re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other\\u2019s faces, so it\\u2019s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It\\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\\u2019t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night, after hours, and I\\u2019m at the coffee shop - next door and outside. There are bins of spices. The owner of the coffee shop who I know socially is pouring the spices from the containers he used during the day and into the larger bulk bins. I see he accidentally mixes the salt and cayenne, pouring the salt into the cayenne bin and the cayenne into the salt bin. He\\u2019s distracted. He doesn\\u2019t realize what he\\u2019s doing in the moment. He realizes that I\\u2019m there and then notices his mistake and realizes he ruined the salt and cayenne and they\\u2019re basically unusable. Jeremy is here now. They are both implicating me and saying that I caused him to make this mistake and brought an evil omen.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at the table with my bodywork teacher and people who are new to his work and paying for continuing education. He invites me to stay, listen and learn again anything I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m giving a session to Gemma outside in a courtyard. There\\u2019s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He\\u2019s good friends with Gemma, maybe they\\u2019re lovers. I\\u2019m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she\\u2019s going to the dinner later. I\\u2019m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, \\u201cThank you, that was really great.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting feedback but there isn\\u2019t time. Some other things happen and it\\u2019s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can\\u2019t come in because he\\u2019s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It\\u2019s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I\\u2019m not quite sure what they are because they\\u2019ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn\\u2019t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn\\u2019t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they\\u2019re much larger than me. I\\u2019m either really far away or I\\u2019ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I\\u2019m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It\\u2019s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It\\u2019s an ornate room with wood floors. There\\u2019s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they\\u2019re going to trap me, I\\u2019ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month\\u2019s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I\\u2019m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it\\u2019s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn\\u2019t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji\\u2019s ashram comes in and she\\u2019s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I\\u2019m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn\\u2019t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019ve been banished and will never be able to return. You\\u2019re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.\\u201d She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.\\u201d She laughs. I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don\\u2019t realize that I\\u2019m the one who took the entire community\\u2019s water.\"],[\"I\\u2019m supposed to co-teach a yoga class with Les. People have arrived at the hotel. I\\u2019m there and walking around the room talking to the students. Then I realize I\\u2019m wearing a short white cotton dress. The room is heating up for class. I realize I\\u2019ll sweat and this dress will be transparent and I won\\u2019t be able to demo in it. I look up at the clock and see that I have just enough time to slip over to the boutique and pick up some yoga clothes. When I get there, the people are really helpful. They give me a bodysuit. I slip it on but it doesn\\u2019t look good at all. It\\u2019s taking a lot more time than I expected and there aren\\u2019t many other appropriate options for my body or teaching. Then I find a little pair of stretchy corduroy shorts and a top. I pull them on and think it will do. I go back and when I get back, the class is almost over and I\\u2019ve missed the whole thing while I was trying to find appropriate clothes to teach in.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving down on a mountain road. There are alpacas sitting on the side and people have set up camps in the forests. I\\u2019m looking for a place to hunker down for the night. I drive all the way to the top and then back down. I stop near a sweet family of alpacas, or maybe they\\u2019re llamas because they\\u2019re bigger. The mama llama has her babies tucked in close to her body. As I\\u2019m admiring them, somebody comes down after me. They\\u2019re yelling at me and accusing me of killing the alpacas up higher on the road. Someone says, \\u201cNo, she loves alpacas.\\u201d I\\u2019m bewildered because I\\u2019m brand new to this place and I\\u2019ve never seen these people. Jules comes down and says I can stay in the loft. I go into this cute wooden cottage. There\\u2019s a bed and I can tell people come and go from this place a lot. It\\u2019s a spot for travelers and friends. I settle in a little then go back down to join the others.\"],[\"There is a dance ritual to perform tonight. I\\u2019m up high on a mountain with a flat area, like a plateau with sheer cliffs rather than a mountain peak. Some structures have been built up here. The ritual is for the sun. i don\\u2019t know if the sun is setting or rising. It\\u2019s very dark. All I see at the horizon is an orange ball of light. There\\u2019s a change of plans. Now the ritual is happening in the pool. There are a lot of people. The only one I recognize is a mama friend. We talk on the steps leading into the pool. I don\\u2019t recall anything about the conversation or the ritual. I\\u2019m talking with Mary about human origins. She says something about the latest research and the shape of your legs. She says she can tell me about my origin by holding my breasts in her hands to weigh them and get a sense of them and me. I agree and shift my shirt and bra to the side. She does so. She says, \\u201cOh you are a brigar peggis mortae.\\u201d She steps back and points to these flanks hanging up on hooks. They\\u2019re samples of different species. She points to the one that is my origin. I can see that each of the forms have differently shaped acetabuli. I think, \\u201cOh! This shape is why I never could be a professional ballerina.\\u201d I see other shapes that would have allowed me a better turnout for ballet.\"],[\"We\\u2019re setting up for a day at the office, my husband and I. There are suddenly so many people. My husband has six or ten tables set up in a row and every table has a person lying on it. I have my four tables at the end set up perpendicular to his. The tables are really close together so I go to help him rearrange the tables, staggering them by pulling one forward and the next bag. The people stay on the tables while we\\u2019re doing this. Then I lie down on a table so he can check me before I start my day. It takes a really long time for him to get to me. By the time he takes care of me and I go to my people, two of the four are gone. They got frustrated with waiting and I can see why - it\\u2019s been about forty minutes and I\\u2019m running late. I work on the two people remaining then leave to go find the other two. One is in a building next door, it\\u2019s like a mall. She\\u2019s shopping for meditation cushions and some new clothes. We talk and things are okay between us - she just needed to run some errands, but she\\u2019ll come back. She tells me how she has a scholarship to study and they\\u2019re providing room and board for free. She\\u2019ll be staying at the tents. Whoever they are, they are extremely wealthy and they\\u2019re idea of camping is extremely nice. She shows me the camping setup. It\\u2019s a tall and long domed structure made of clay. The beds are set up on a long loft that goes across the entire length of the structure, and they\\u2019re actual beds, not sleeping bags. It\\u2019s warm, too. After the tour, we go down to the bottom floor. As we\\u2019re walking out, a whale is nudging her face through the doorway. Somehow, the structure has been built over deep water. So the whale is pushing her head out and agitating an elephant standing just at the other side of the threshold. I look up and see Kundry sitting atop the elephant. The elephant brings down her head and her trunk gets entangled with the whale. It\\u2019s hard to tell if they\\u2019re in conflict or greeting each other. Kundry is taken down and they get all twisted together. There\\u2019s another large grey animal getting involved, but I can\\u2019t tell what it is.\"],[\"There are four separate interrelated scenes - a really nice apartment condo by the ocean; a little Cobb style house that once belonged to Jeremy; a lovely home and office built around a tree at a retreat center; and a hospital in Hawaii. I am moving into a really nice condo. It\\u2019s modern with new appliances, white walls, high ceilings, big floor to ceiling windows with a view of the ocean from every room. The ocean is choppy and dark, but beautiful. I\\u2019ve never been to New England but it seems like the Atlantic ocean of the northeastern United States. The rent is extremely affordable and I\\u2019m wondering why. I\\u2019m living with a childhood friend (we really only knew each other when I was an infant and he was five) and another woman who comes and goes. We are learning how to live with each other, learning each other\\u2019s rhythms with cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and working. The refrigerator is full of delicious food - produce and prepared meals. I go to see where he is. He\\u2019s napping on a couch with a book across his chest. He has his head towards me then he senses that I\\u2019m there on the couch and he turns his body so his feet are towards me. His knees are open and I feel a warmth and desire awaken in my body. I crawl up towards him and it surprises us both even though there has been an attraction between our souls since the beginning of my life. We go into the kitchen and there is a tentative quality to our interaction now, feeling each other out and this new expression of our relationship. I wrap my legs around him and kiss him. Then for a moment he switches to my dad then switches back. That was weird. But there is a beautiful connection and fluidity in the way we are together. It\\u2019s as if we were made to be together, but waking life circumstances didn\\u2019t work in our favor. Then I learn that the reason this condo is so affordable is because there are cameras everywhere set to film us making love. It\\u2019s like a pornography studio. I don\\u2019t really know what to make of it. But I love being here at the ocean and with him, so it\\u2019s okay. Then, the dream shifts. I am walking by a little Cobb style cottage that was for sale, but now it looks like someone has recently bought it and moved in. I think this house once belonged to Jeremy and Zoe. It\\u2019s really crafty. There are waves carved over the mantel and the front door. It\\u2019s tan and brown, really of the earth. There\\u2019s a wooden fence all around and a little garden. Inside, a fire is burning in the fireplace. Herbs are hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is warm and carved of wood. Everything is just enough and just right. No one is home. I go in through the door in the back and am walking around, curious to see if it feels like home to me. In a way, it does. I make a cup of tea and sit in front of the fire. Then I get a sense that whoever lives here will be returning home soon, so I need to make it look like I wasn\\u2019t there, moving things back and covering up my presence. I leave and walk around the corner past the front. This is when I see this symbolic spiral wave over the front door and I can see through the door and walls to how the design over the mantel is a continuation of this design. I walk away into another scene. I\\u2019m with my mom, dad and sister. We are touring a gorgeous place with a real estate agent. It\\u2019s a home modeled around a huge tree. It\\u2019s built in the round, like a spiral. There\\u2019s a lovely glass sunroom that wraps nearly all around and a deck around that. When you walk in, there\\u2019s the tree trunk, a fireplace and a sitting area with long curving couches designed for this space. A doorway leads to a spacious bedroom which I don\\u2019t go into yet. The home spirals to the right to a beautiful kitchen with an island. It\\u2019s a community kitchen with a pantry stocked full. It continues into a laundry room and a room for the cats. As we are in the kitchen, another group comes in and goes upstairs. The real estate is angry because we now know how public this home is - anyone who lives at the retreat center has full access to this kitchen and to the offices upstairs. There is a recording studio and office with computers and printer upstairs. It is quite loud and we realize it won\\u2019t be a private home. We are still interested though. She shows us through the laundry room to the glass sunroom and cat walk that spirals around the front. It\\u2019s warm and bright and there is a cat lounging in the sun. I love it. She takes us upstairs to this beautiful office. Everything is furnished and lovely. We go back downstairs and into the spacious bedroom. I realize this is an apartment in and of itself. It\\u2019s big and open. There\\u2019s a fireplace where you can roast potatoes in the ashes. There are old fashioned iron stovetops with terracotta pots set on top to radiate warmth into the space. They are cooking a feast of roasted chickens and breads and other kinds of meat and vegetables. It smells so good. I tell my dad, \\u201cHow wonderful would it be to learn how to use these stoves and cook these gorgeous meals?!\\u201d I go down one step to look at the bedroom to see if it will be good for my husband, son and me. There\\u2019s a huge bed. The room feels spacious and it\\u2019s flooded with sunlight. I love it. On the far side of the bedroom is something like a clear plastic tent tarp. Through it I see seven beds lined up against the wall. They are covered with colorful pillows and it\\u2019s so bright and inviting. There\\u2019s a paper with instructions for how to set up the pillows so they all fit. I think how wonderful it would be to invite friends over. I want to negotiate with the realtor about renting just this part of the treehouse, not the whole place. She won\\u2019t get as much of a commission as she wanted, but maybe she\\u2019ll be happy to have something rather than nothing. As we are leaving, we are putting on our shoes on the deck just outside the front door. My dad is trying to be funny. We have the same kind of shoes - brown plastic slippers. He\\u2019s trying to put on one of my shoes but it of course doesn\\u2019t fit. I tell him to give me back my shoe. Then I\\u2019m in a hospital in Hawaii. I\\u2019m partially in a room with a curtain and partially outside. My best friend from middle school is giving birth. They are torturing her, pushing on her stomach, squeezing and twisting. She\\u2019s in so much pain. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do it that way! You\\u2019re hurting her and the baby!\\u201d I think the baby is dead inside her. She\\u2019s exhausted. I\\u2019m also pregnant and giving birth. I won\\u2019t let anyone touch me. I feel my own stomach and the baby\\u2019s head is down and to the left and okay. I\\u2019m watching people rush around because this is an emergency room. A friend from college, is the doctor. I ask him to check me because I think I can trust him not to harm me or my baby. He approaches me tentatively. He is still unsure of himself around me because I rejected him so many years ago. He has a butter knife with what looks like raw ground beef on it. He puts a towel over me and checks. He brings the knife up and there is blood dripping from it onto his nose. There\\u2019s a look in his eyes like, \\u201cThis could have been my baby.\\u201d He is sad about the loss of our friendship and his desire to be in relationship. The labor is continuing and getting stronger. I look out into the city scene. It\\u2019s mostly grey and full of the sounds of a busy city. Through the grey I see bright red and yellow, the colors of Hawaiian royalty. The Hawaiians have joined together with their drums and are playing the rhythm of life, birth and death. I drum along with them on my belly as if my tummy is an ipu. I see one man stand up above the rest with his drum and he\\u2019s so full of vitality and passion. The passion and rhythm are in such contrast to the city, but this is what I tune into - the red and yellow and drums.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a big theater, like where they host the Grammys. Every seat is occupied. I\\u2019m sitting near the front at the far left with a small group of people, including JP Spears the comedian with a YouTube channel who has swung pretty disturbingly really far left, borderline Q. I don't\\u2019 recognize anyone else in my group from waking life. He\\u2019s put together a routine for us to perform with him. I\\u2019m his assistant. He is telling me about the routine where he\\u2019ll make someone float and make them appear to be him. The person he points out is a young girl with long red hair like him. She is unconscious or asleep. We go up the stairs to the stage and he places her on a table. He tosses a blue blanket over her naked body. I\\u2019m concerned for her modesty and adjust the blanket as he begins the show. He begins the act and somehow he raises her from the table so she\\u2019s floating in the air. This is supposed to be the peak of the performance. There was another part where he made other images of himself, one where he is an older version of himself with a bulbous nose and greying hair. At the end of the routine there isn\\u2019t a lot of applause and we all return to our seats. Other presentations continue on the stage. JP Spears is now lying across the top of the seats in front of me. There is a guy sitting to my right who was somewhat attractive. It looks and sounds like they are masturbating each other. They are breathing heavily. It\\u2019s disturbing and disgusting. I lean in a bit to see if they\\u2019re actually doing what I think they\\u2019re doing. JP Spears cums in my face and I\\u2019m utterly disgusted now. It gets in my eye and mouth. I get up and leave right away. I\\u2019m deciding what to do and where to go now. I don\\u2019t know who to report them to, or if I should. I\\u2019m outside the theatre. It\\u2019s dark and raining. I\\u2019m trying to find a car to get back home. I don\\u2019t have a home here in this place. So I\\u2019m trying to figure out where to go. Later in the dream I am in a house that I\\u2019m sharing with my sister and a woman from my current hometown - she and I do the same kind of work, and we\\u2019re sharing a room. My sister has her own room. I can\\u2019t fall asleep so I get up and wander around the house. The house is a mess with partially unpacked boxes and piles of clothes everywhere. I feel bad about this chaos and how sloppy I am. I just don\\u2019t have the energy to put the house in order and it\\u2019s also nighttime. She is awake reading, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a good idea to make a bunch of noise trying to clean up. I walk past the kitchen and my parents walk in through the door. They are returning early from a trip to the Big Island. They had plans to go on island tours and enjoy the island. They were at dinner and a Senator approached them and told them it was pleasant to see them, but with COVID still actively spreading, they should go home. This is not the time for vacationing. They tell me they were able to catch an early flight. My mom has brought my sister and me some new clothes and jewelry. She has laid out an outfit on the ground - a Christmas sweater that lights up and belonged to my grandmother, jeggings and a gold necklace. My dad has set out guacamole and tortillas for a midnight snack. I eat it and feel better. I get a call from Edward to prepare for a Zoom meeting with a woman who has been working with us. He wants me to find the contract so he can graciously thank her for her help, knowing exactly when she started working with us. I am looking through emails to find the contract but am not sure if that was the exact start date. The first email introduction was sent on October 24. We get on Zoom and she\\u2019s calling in from a kids pool. She\\u2019s on a playdate with her grandchildren and some others. She has her feet in the water with them and they\\u2019re all having a wonderful time splashing and playing on the slides.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s raining. I\\u2019m in a city, a rough part of the city. There\\u2019s a woman standing next to her pickup truck. Somebody is watching her. Actually several people are watching her because I see her and a sinister person sees her from the shadows and another person calls her. The person on the phone is watching out for people and giving them a safe place to hide where they will be protected. So she gets a call on her cell phone from an anonymous person. Somehow I can hear the call and it\\u2019s a voice I recognize from earlier in the dream. This is the voice that leads people to the safe haven. They flash coordinates for the woman to follow so she can get to the haven. She puts the phone down and gets into her truck and takes off, really fast. I\\u2019m following her and can\\u2019t tell if she\\u2019s going to continue across the bridge or not. She turns left right before the bridge behind an old building and into a construction site. When you look carefully, this construction site is actually a playground for kids. There are bridges and climbing apparatuses all made of car parts and such. I\\u2019m following because I\\u2019ve wanted to find this place for a long time but have never had the actual coordinates. I hope that the sinister person that was tracking her and others isn\\u2019t fast enough to find her. Now I\\u2019m somehow in the safe house. There\\u2019s a swamp all around it. People that I dip with in the river. We\\u2019re all in the kitchen and people are coming and going. I think I\\u2019m getting ready to leave on a mission. There\\u2019s a pie in the drawer and I have a piece but it\\u2019s so good that I eat more. My son has a piece and my husband eats a bigger piece. It\\u2019s all gone now and I feel a little bad that we\\u2019ve eaten it all. Now I\\u2019m helping fold a tablecloth which looks more like an altar cloth. I can see all the pleats where it was folded tightly and neatly to fit into a small bag. I\\u2019m unable to fold it that well and instead fold it like I would a sheet. It won\\u2019t fit back into its bag, though. More people come in and are eating around the table and socializing and arranging to go out again in small groups.\"],[\"I\\u2019m trying to record a meditation or yoga video. I\\u2019m setting up my space and the camera, trying different locations and viewpoints. I need to set the camera at an angle so it doesn\\u2019t highlight my scoliosis because I think it would be a distraction. I set myself kind of under the staircase. I get a good frame but then realize my son\\u2019s Mickey Mouse car is in the frame and I have to rearrange the space again. It\\u2019s frustrating and I\\u2019m running out of time. I\\u2019m wondering where else I could do this, but anywhere else would have distracting background noises. I just want to get this done and move on. Earlier in the dream, there\\u2019s a show that we are preparing. We are a random group of people and I don\\u2019t recognize any of them. We haven\\u2019t rehearsed together, but are now suddenly being pulled together for this performance piece. I\\u2019m getting ready and a few women are helping me with my makeup. I need to choose a foundation and am asking them for their recommendation. One might be a bit too brown, but they say the pink one is nice and youthful. These women are very good with makeup and skilled in its application. I\\u2019m not so skilled with this particular art, but am grateful for their help. A woman is here and she is stealing everybody\\u2019s intellectual property by observing and copying their performances exactly. She\\u2019s stolen away and we have to find her and be sure she doesn\\u2019t succeed. All I have as clues is that she is wearing pale silk fabrics.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, everybody is stuck repeating their same dream over and over and over again. This is the thirteenth night. We\\u2019re all having our own dreams, but they overlap in places where we have encounters with each other. The main place where my dream overlaps and encounters others\\u2019 is at a really small airport. The main person, the dream is interacting with is Rose and people from her dreams. Each time this interaction of dreams happens, there is an opportunity to figure out why the repetition is happening. Between the two of us, we have a chance to interrupt the continued repetitions and be free. This time around, Rose shows up while I\\u2019m waiting in line for my ticket. She\\u2019s wearing fitness clothes for pole dancing - little shorts and a tank top. She has a workout bag full of clothes and toiletries. She\\u2019s waiting for a plane, but so far in all the dreams the plane has never come. I\\u2019m in this airport also waiting for a plane or maybe a train. It's dingy in here and there aren\\u2019t any windows. There\\u2019s a round table that reminds me of the ones at my high school cafeteria. There is stale coffee in styrofoam cups and the wooden sticks to stir in fake sure and half and half, but no food. We\\u2019re all waiting in line for our tickets then going back to the table to wait more. One of the owners of the pole dancing studio shows up with her husband. She\\u2019s wearing a grey sweatsuit, but still looks sexy with her hair and makeup done just right. I feel self conscious and awkward because I recognize her but am not sure if she recognizes me or if she does, if she remembers my name. This happens to me in waking life because I have a good memory for people\\u2019s faces and names, but there are people who I must introduce myself to time and time again because they seem to have no memory of me. She and Rose and a few others are sitting together at one of the tables. It\\u2019s grimy because it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned well in a long time. There\\u2019s trash on the floor and the trashcan nearby is overflowing. Rose gets up and goes to the bathroom to change. She comes out in a black tank top, black pole dancing shorts and black heels. She\\u2019s extra tall. I\\u2019m walking next to her and feel short and frumpy because she is over six feet in her heels and lean, where I am short and deconditioned. We walk to a shower room that\\u2019s like a truck stop shower. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cViviane, we\\u2019ve gotta figure out how to get out of here. Tell me what this dream sequence means.\\u201d She thinks that if we can find out what it means, we will be free. I can\\u2019t recall what happens, though I know we are discussing the dreams.\"],[\"I was heading in to teach several thousand people. There\\u2019s this huge room and all these people are piling in and it was almost an anxiety dream about teaching.\"],[\"This morning I was dreaming about my daughter and then I feel like I was dreaming about Meghan Markle, but I can\\u2019t remember what.\"],[\"I had a dream that someone came to clean my sink. They opened up the sink and it went down, down, down - all the way down like 1 or 2 stories. I was like, \\u201cHow is the sink filling if it\\u2019s that low down there?\\u201d He had a spiral thing and got all the hair and gunk out. Then he made it crystal clean and perfect. He put the stuff back.\"],[\"I dreamed of Brad Pitt.\"],[\"In the dream, I\\u2019m walking with Sabrina. She\\u2019s actually nice and normal, not malevolent or dark. I remember thinking in the dream that maybe this is her core energy that is covered by everything else. Or maybe this was before something happened? She asks me if I can dance ballet. I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t do pointe, but I can dance some.\\u201d Then she wants me to dance or show her. So I start to do ballet. I leap into the air and as I leap, I start to fly. I start flying up in the air in circles, dancing around her. She\\u2019s below and is amazed. There are other people below me, looking at me and are like, \\u201cWow!\\u201d At a certain point, I realize Sabrina can\\u2019t fly. Then I realize the things I can do that she can\\u2019t do, which has been a theme in a few of the dreams with her, even the dark ones - I can meet her power and am even more powerful than she is. I\\u2019m struck by that in the dream. At a certain point, I\\u2019m dancing and flying, then the air of the Holy Spirit goes into me through my yoni. I realize I\\u2019m being made love to by the Universe, by God, by Spirit. Then I become filled with the Holy Spirit and impregnated.\"],[\"I dreamt of Keanu Reeves again.\"],[\"This dream was about Trump (I\\u2019ve never dreamt of Trump before). In the dream, I\\u2019m in a top apartment or maybe a nice hotel or maybe a really nice attic apartment. I\\u2019m at the top of something. I\\u2019m sealing everything up. I\\u2019m closing the doors, I\\u2019m taping the windows, I\\u2019m taping the cracks. I\\u2019m sealing everything up because something really bad is about to happen and it\\u2019s connected to Trump. I\\u2019m assuming it\\u2019s toxic or poisonous or something.

I can\\u2019t remember the specifics. In another scene, I see a huge tidal wave - 100 feet and right there I have my daughter with me and I grab her hand and say, \\u201cCome with me!\\u201d I pull her into this giant building that we just happened to be walking by - a really tall, huge building. I pul us in and lose the door and it secures. We just make it as this wave goes by. I notice when we\\u2019re in there that there are no windows and I guess this is why we were safe. It may have been a gymnasium, all concrete with no windows and huge. I\\u2019m not sure if anyone else was in there. It\\u2019s possible there were a few others, though. It was definitely not a full building. I feel like when I pulled her in, I ran her up some stairs so we could go up a few levels, but it\\u2019s vague. We are in the right place at the right time for having just walked by this building when this tidal wave was coming. If we were anywhere else we would have been caught in it. Towards the end I\\u2019m like, okay, when we walk out, everybody will have died. There\\u2019s no way anyone survived that. We hadn\\u2019t gone back out yet, I was just bracing myself for going out to see what happened.\"],[\"There are underground labyrinth subterranean pools. They are dark and kind of dirty looking, almost like a sewer. People would go in them and get lost and never come out. They were hidden everywhere. They\\u2019d come out everywhere. You could just be walking in the city, then there's this place hidden in plain sight and it\\u2019s a portal into these subterranean chambers and also coming back out. They\\u2019re hidden, but if I lift something up, I can see them. But they don\\u2019t look like they should be lifted. You have to know to lift it to see what\\u2019s underneath. Then there\\u2019s a tunnel or some kind of portal into the labyrinth. When I see the hidden places, I can't just go lift up the top, I have to ask the teacher. There\\u2019s some person in there. People aren\\u2019t supposed to touch these things. But I\\u2019m not in a class, so I don\\u2019t understand that. At one point I see one and I lift it without asking. I almost get in trouble. I finally found the end of it where all of them go to or come from. It\\u2019s like a giant hot tub. I pulled open the top and it was steaming and swirling but also dirty looking, almost like a sewer. I could not figure out how people go in there and then almost had to swim under to then find the space to pop up in. It just looked really gross and I couldn\\u2019t figure out how people breathed in it. At one point, the teacher or leader says something about me as I\\u2019m walking away - I think it\\u2019s when I apologized for opening one of them without asking and they were like, oh it\\u2019s okay okay.

They\\u2019re following you.\\u201d It was like a lightbulb went on my brain: Oh, I\\u2019m being followed because of my light and tracked by these darker energies. It was almost like what you\\u2019d imagine if someone is being followed by spies or the CIA. At one point, I\\u2019m in my house and locking all the doors to make sure no one can get in. At a certain point, Tom Hanks is there and he\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve never dreamt of him before. He\\u2019s being creepy, but I\\u2019m being naive and nice, thinking he\\u2019s just nice. We must be at a hotel pool because I\\u2019m lying somewhere reading a book and relaxing. I realize I don\\u2019t do this a lot because I work so much. Tom Hanks is there and he\\u2019s really close to me. He comments on the book I\\u2019m reading: \\u201cOh you\\u2019ve been reading that book for a while.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, you know, I\\u2019m just relaxing.\\u201d Later on I wonder how he knows I\\u2019ve been reading this book for a while? Then he starts to touch my neck I\\u2019m really weirded out and am like, \\u201cStop, stop, stop.\\u201d It wakes me up. As I wake up, I make this really weird noise with my throat, like a choking guttural noise. I have a weird energy waking up from this dream and making that sound. There were other parts of the dream where I remember being in the rafters of a giant building and I\\u2019m hiding from these bad guys. I can fly between buildings.\"],[\"\\u201cDriving with Bernard\\u201d I was visiting Bernard and Carol. I park in their garage. I had recently gotten my hair cut or trimmed again - I had just chopped it. The person that cut it, cut it wrong and cut it too close and it looked disgusting. There are ravens and crows in Bernard\\u2019s garage. I've been with them a long time and it\\u2019s late, so he drives me home. But he\\u2019s tired. I forgot that my car is in their garage. He seems slightly annoyed that it\\u2019s late and he\\u2019s having to drive. He drives on the walls! I freak out and ask him if Carol is okay with this. He\\u2019s driving more like a skateboarder kid, so he\\u2019s going straight, then he\\u2019s going up on the wall and going down and then going up again. He\\u2019s acting kind of like a child. Then he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes. But it\\u2019s not a major crash. He just lightly hits a wall. I end up having to call for help. Carol is worried. I end up bringing him home. I have to take him upstairs. Then I get in my own car and leave. At some point, I see a silver french bulldog that I used to own in dreamtime, but rehomed it. I keep thinking about getting a dog, but we had a dog once and we rehomed him because he was the neediest dog ever and competing with my daughter for my attention, but the whole point of getting this dog was so that he and my daughter could bond. So I rehomed him. I used to have this french bulldog in the dream, but was like, \\u201cOh, I got rid of it.\\u201d\"],[\"I dreamt of this guy who showed up in my dreams as an animus figure. He used to show up as a new animus figure, a healthy, good, kind, integrated masculine. But then he shifted into a wounded masculine figure. He\\u2019s there in the dream and he\\u2019s into me and I\\u2019m hanging out with him. At a certain point, he is going to kiss me then he pulls away. I end up kissing him. Then I think to myself, \\u201cI\\u2019m being the masculine here.\\u201d His mouth is limp. It\\u2019s weird. His roommates tell me he is like a child and they always have to pick up after him and he\\u2019s really immature.\"],[\"I had a dream of my friend Havilah in a beautiful landscape that reminded me of Panther Meadows.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to get two cats that I had dropped off. But when we get them, they\\u2019re adolescent tigers. They\\u2019re nuzzling each other. We\\u2019re petting them and they\\u2019re playful. I\\u2019m surprised that they\\u2019re tigers now. Then I see our old dog who we rehomed years ago because he needed a different situation, but then he ended up dying. He\\u2019s old and blind and bleeding. I grab him to rehabilitate him. He looks very sad.\"],[\"A dream of shoes and shoe boxes. There\\u2019s a white shoe with a heel, like a wedding shoe for some lady. There are lots of shoes, pairing up. I\\u2019m trying to find shoes that fit me and my daughter. Then I realize I\\u2019ll probably just donate the rest to the homeless.\"],[\"I had a weird dream. I was at an Anaiya Sophia ritual. There\\u2019s water in the fridge in a silver carafe. It\\u2019s salty and leaking all over. I use her bath towels to clean it out. During the ritual, a helicopter is spraying the water but runs out of water. I go to a room and open the door. A man and a child are in a bathtub. I see him at a pool. There are women like snakes and things on the floor in Anaiya Sophia\\u2019s bathroom.\"],[\"I saw a big pink church, a school on a hill. As I take a picture, a voice says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ego-maniichal church.\\u201d It was like a big really expensive church up on a mountain like in Malibu.\"],[\"I was booking flights somewhere abroad, maybe Europe or Egypt, in that direction. I was realizing that we were going to get free or really discounted business class upgrades. I was really excited to be traveling again.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of \\u201chouse,\\u201d but I can\\u2019t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we\\u2019re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can\\u2019t live on Gaia anymore and it\\u2019s not worth the effort to try to save her. She\\u2019s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.\"],[\"There are just snippets of this dream that came through. I\\u2019m in the kitchen of my childhood home trying to put dishes away and reorganize the cabinet. My sister\\u2019s there with me. She\\u2019s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she\\u2019s always playing the victim. Then I\\u2019m in a house - it\\u2019s close by my childhood home. There\\u2019s a man living in it who\\u2019s apparently my significant other, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There\\u2019s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he\\u2019s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I\\u2019m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I\\u2019m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There\\u2019s an opera house. It\\u2019s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I\\u2019m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I\\u2019m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There\\u2019s all kinds of magical things in them. It\\u2019s dark up in here and I\\u2019m looking through them. Then I decide it\\u2019s time to leave. Now I\\u2019m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I\\u2019m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There\\u2019s so much snow and I\\u2019m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I\\u2019m driving down, there\\u2019s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn\\u2019t I stop to let them go by, don\\u2019t I know that pedestrians have the right of way. I look at them and I look ahead of me where there\\u2019s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It\\u2019s a small street, I\\u2019m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my ex again (this is the second night in a row). There is tension between the two of us. He says he\\u2019s moving and wants to take some of the furniture. We\\u2019re standing in the kid\\u2019s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it\\u2019s very dark in there. I see that there\\u2019s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don\\u2019t care if he takes them. There\\u2019s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I\\u2019m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I\\u2019m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I\\u2019m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I\\u2019m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I\\u2019m still a mother. I still have two children. They\\u2019re still with me. And my godmother says let\\u2019s just go. All of a sudden we\\u2019re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I\\u2019m starting to get upset because I realize we didn\\u2019t pack anything. There\\u2019s no food. There\\u2019s no water. I don\\u2019t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don\\u2019t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I\\u2019m sure. I say, \\u201cyes, we don\\u2019t have any of the things we need.\\u201d She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there\\u2019s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we\\u2019re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we\\u2019re heading back the other way. We\\u2019re all fine, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, \\u201c well, we\\u2019re going to take a shortcut.\\u201d And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He\\u2019s young - he\\u2019s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He\\u2019s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There\\u2019s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there\\u2019s display cases and a buffet table. I\\u2019m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don\\u2019t because I\\u2019m allergic to rice and I\\u2019m allergic to soy and I can\\u2019t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I\\u2019m heartbroken because number one, I\\u2019m starving, and number two, I haven\\u2019t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m traveling in a car with all my siblings - it\\u2019s a van so we can all fit. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. We seem to be having an okay time. The scene changes really suddenly and there\\u2019s an impression that a lot of time has passed - weeks, months, perhaps. I\\u2019m really confused and don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019ve gotten to where I am. I feel like I\\u2019m waking up or seeing things that are really new and strange for me. My mom is there and she tells me that the car I had been traveling had crashed. My dad had been driving it and the accident was pretty bad. Everything is okay now. My body is fine. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with me. It seems so strange that there could have been an accident and I don\\u2019t remember it at all. She tells me it was pretty bad. I have no idea if my siblings or dad made it because it\\u2019s just me and my mom. The scene changes again and I\\u2019m with a bunch of friends from high school and some friends from now. We\\u2019re in a basement of a building. It has a huge storage unit and has all kinds of things in it from older times but also feels like a theatre costume room. We\\u2019re searching for a very specific item for one of my friends. As we go through all this stuff, it seems kind of weird - all these random bits of fabric and buttons. But we\\u2019re not finding what we\\u2019re looking for. Then the scene changes again. I\\u2019m on a soccer field and I\\u2019m really wanting to play, but I have these white shoes I need to put on and it\\u2019s taking me forever to put the shoes on and the laces are really long. My friend who is also a masseuse is there as well. He\\u2019s playing soccer and he\\u2019s playing really well. I want to go and play, but I also feel like maybe I\\u2019m not good enough and maybe that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s taking me so long to put my shoes on. Although he does keep trying to pass me the ball, but I\\u2019m still on the sidelines. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m not allowed to be on the team. It\\u2019s a full size field and a full size ball, then it suddenly switches to a very small room. We\\u2019re all still trying to fit in and play soccer, and the ball has shrunk down to about the size of a softball and it\\u2019s yellow. My friend keeps trying to pass the ball to me and I keep missing. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019ve never played soccer before. Then I get tired of it because I feel like I really can\\u2019t play and I can\\u2019t get these shoes on. All of my high school friends are still around and one of them is in a bed. I go sit on the bed and talk with her. Then a bunch of others come. They\\u2019re talking about all these adventures they\\u2019ve gone and are going to go on, and all these places they\\u2019ve seen around the world. I\\u2019m sitting there feeling frustrated because I\\u2019ve not done any of that - in my whole life, I\\u2019ve not gone to have a vacation in Costa Rica or Belize and they\\u2019re telling these fantastical stories of when they\\u2019ve gone. They\\u2019re also very chummy, but I feel like the outsider - definitely outsider vibes. Then the scene shifts a little bit, and while there\\u2019s still this big bed that we\\u2019ve all congregated on, now they\\u2019re talking about Brad Pitt and another actor from way back in the day. They\\u2019re talking about how Brad Pitt keeps saying that he could date any woman he wanted, but oddly enough, he\\u2019s still single and nobody really wants to date him and how he just brags all the time. Then we\\u2019re talking about Jennifer Lopez and how she has so much money because she bought an open market in France and charges a commission for each store that is there in the market and so she just makes this passive income forever and ever. Even magazines have commented on how she has this structure and foundation so she doesn\\u2019t have to rely on the work she puts out and if her albums are any good. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. There\\u2019s a building that looks kind of like a town hall you\\u2019d rent for a function, but it\\u2019s a bit grander than that. The patio area has these huge columns like the Roman columns you see in ruins. It\\u2019s night time. It\\u2019s dark out. There\\u2019s a lot of people I don\\u2019t know at the party, but there\\u2019s a lot of my classmates from high school there, too. We\\u2019re hanging out but I have this feeling of being the outsider and not really welcomed or not included somehow. I\\u2019m watching what\\u2019s going on and I\\u2019m trying to get the attention of my classmates but I\\u2019m awkward about it and I don\\u2019t really know how. Then one of my classmates who I\\u2019ve known since we were 8 sees me and hangs out together and kinda takes me under his wing. He\\u2019s showing me around this party - just the outside perimeter part, we still haven\\u2019t gone into any of the building. He\\u2019s getting really comfortable with me. His arm is around me and there\\u2019s this air of ownership almost. I do not like it. I remember when we were in high school and flashing back to when he was a little more touchy feely than I liked. I\\u2019m not excited that he\\u2019s doing that, but I also wanted to see everyone. Eventually I peel myself away. Then some sort of time goes by and I\\u2019m walking around this party and I realize there\\u2019s this point on one side where it was the outside of the party and there\\u2019s grass fields and trees. Time is going on normally. But there\\u2019s a partition and on the other side of this line, everything has been frozen. The people there are asleep. I realize that if I cross over this line and walk into it, I can see them, I can see that they\\u2019re asleep or frozen and I can also bring them out of it. When I do, six years has passed on one side of the line and no time has passed on their side. It\\u2019s very odd. They\\u2019re still who they were and time has gone on on the other side. The dreams shifts completely and my two children are with me. We are walking down to the beach. We walk down this path and on either side of the path are noni bushes - bushes I grew up with in Hawaii. As soon as I come out of the path onto the walkway that skirts the edge of the beach, a lifeguard greets me and says, \\u201chello, good morning, welcome.\\u201d I look up and it\\u2019s my ex boyfriend who used to be a lifeguard. I\\u2019m so surprised that he was so friendly to me. I say, \\u201chello.\\u201d He sees who it is and the friendliness disappears immediately. He says something nasty. I ask him if he\\u2019s still going to be mean to me and if he\\u2019s still mad at me. He says essentially yes forever. That hurt my feelings a little bit but I realized there wasn\\u2019t much I could do about that. He couldn\\u2019t keep me off the beach with the kids and we keep going. I see to my left a huge pool - an outdoor pool. Some of those same friends from the party are in the pool and I feel like I\\u2019ve been looking for them. I head their direction and the kids are with me, but again I feel this weird outsider feeling like I wasn\\u2019t quite invited and I\\u2019m going to be the weird kid that shows up at the party even though they weren\\u2019t invited. But I walk towards the pool anyway and both the kids get in the pool because they\\u2019re really excited to swim. I\\u2019m staying on the edge and all those classmates are ignoring me. But then they start playing with my son and teaching him how to jump in the pool. They continue to ignore me even though they can very clearly see me. My daughter is not excited about this either. She can see that there\\u2019s this outsider vibe going and she\\u2019s backing off and away, too. I\\u2019m trying to keep an eye on her and an eye on my son. Then we get out of the pool and begin to walk away. The awkwardness just gets to be too much. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a beach - lots of sand, kiawe trees all around and they\\u2019re hanging kind of low. I\\u2019m on set. There\\u2019s a movie being filmed. I\\u2019m not part of the movie. I\\u2019m just watching. I can hear the ocean rolling in, the waves are not to be big and I\\u2019m listening to the all actors say their lines. There\\u2019s about five of them sitting around in chairs doing their scenes and one of the actors is Henry Cavill - the guy who plays Superman. I\\u2019m a little bit starstruck and awestruck, but I\\u2019m staying out of the way just watching him. I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. So I watch them for a little bit and he takes a while to come out onto the set to do his lines, but then he leaves. I have definitely got an eye on him - just watching everything he does. Then somehow I get incorporated into the scene and it\\u2019s not so much that they\\u2019re filming anymore, it\\u2019s that all of the actors and myself, we\\u2019re all hanging out, working out. The beach setting has changed to an outdoor weight room setting with weight machines. It\\u2019s like we\\u2019re playing musical chairs but we\\u2019re doing it with the weight machines and we all keep going from one to the next. Somehow I\\u2019m part of the crew even though it\\u2019s all the actors now and we take turns doing our sets and then we all rotate one and get moved to the next machines. Of course I still have my eye on Henry Cavill because he played Superman, he\\u2019s hot. But there\\u2019s not a lot of talking still. All the other actors talk amongst themselves quite a bit, but I\\u2019m still quiet and observing for the most part. I think I answer a few questions from some of the other actors, but I\\u2019m feeling shy. Then I leave that place. Even though I\\u2019ve been integrated with the cast, I leave and go somewhere else - it\\u2019s outside and I have the impression that it\\u2019s part of a school. The handyman of the school - who in real life in this realm is the handyman at the place I live - he\\u2019s there at this school. There\\u2019s a big white box truck. He\\u2019s telling me how excited he is because they cleared out the storage units and got rid of hundreds of pounds of meat and pork. I\\u2019m so confused because I don\\u2019t know why they have meat and pork in the storage units because usually the handyman has all of the tools in the storage units. But I ask him, \\u201chey, if you have more, let me know, because if you\\u2019re just giving away really good meat I will take it.\\u201d He says, \\u201cyes, but mostly it\\u2019s all gone.\\u201d I\\u2019m just excited for him because he\\u2019s so excited. Then I leave that place and go back to the set area and now it\\u2019s a much bigger area. It\\u2019s not just that beach. There\\u2019s an actual set where there\\u2019s scenery that\\u2019s been built and put up. It\\u2019s also part of a neighborhood. I can see houses and there\\u2019s streets. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch and I\\u2019m very very tired so I\\u2019m half laying on it. One of the actors - a male - comes and sits next to me. Because we\\u2019ve all spent time getting to know each other, it\\u2019s very comfortable, it\\u2019s fine that he sits next to me. Then I see Henry Cavill come towards me and he doesn\\u2019t have anything in his hand yet, but he kneels down and he says, \\u201cYou have to have known that it was going to be one of the two of us that was going to come and propose to you,\\u201d - but not like a marriage proposal, but just like be my partner for life type of proposal. I\\u2019m smiling at him because I knew that it would happen, I just didn\\u2019t know when. So I say of course. Then he backs up and pulls this violin out from under the couch and some of the other cast members and the orchestra that was part of the movie playing the soundtrack start to play this song and it\\u2019s so funny because it\\u2019s weird and it\\u2019s a little bit high pitched. They\\u2019ve got violins and they\\u2019re all singing the song. I can\\u2019t remember what the words are, but it\\u2019s for me. I\\u2019m laughing because it\\u2019s such a funny sounding song, but apparently the whole cast and crew were in on it because they\\u2019re singing and they all seem very excited. There\\u2019s one moment where I look up and I do see an old classmate of mine who\\u2019s been lurking in the background and for one moment I have this huge pang of jealousy because she knew about it before I did and she didn\\u2019t tell me. I get this sense that she didn\\u2019t want it to happen. She wanted Henry for herself. But I pushed that aside because it\\u2019s very clear that he\\u2019s head over heels and nothing is changing that because now the entire set or staging area or place where this movie is being filmed is full of all of these onlookers and he\\u2019s made such a point to make sure that everybody knows that I\\u2019m his number one person, even though he goes back and does scenes. He comes back to me every single time in the sweetest way. He\\u2019s really very sweet and for the most part, everyone is totally happy about it and I am too. Then the scene shifts just a little bit and I\\u2019m sitting with a young girl who\\u2019s part of the cast and we\\u2019ve moved onto the set. We\\u2019re off that couch and now I\\u2019m onto the set somewhere down on those streets. She\\u2019s getting ready to say her lines and whatnot. She\\u2019s showing me this necklace that she has and she says, \\u201cMy mama gave me money for when I finish this play I could go buy a bike.\\u201d She shows me the bike, but this girl is maybe five or six, not really reading yet, but she\\u2019s really really cute with curly blonde hair and this necklace seems to be very important to her - it has the symbol of a bike on it. I\\u2019m very attentive to her and some other babies that end up in the crowd and I\\u2019m watching them. Even though it\\u2019s now part of the scene we\\u2019re creating, Henry and I have a baby between us - it\\u2019s not ours, it\\u2019s a baby that was cast in the role, but he and I are now acting with this baby and taking care of it in a way. Then the scene ends and the dream moves on, but I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting in an outdoor market. It\\u2019s sunny out and warm. I have shorts and a tank top on, my hair is down, and I\\u2019m having a beverage of some sort, doing some work. I look up and I see across the way, two women heading my direction. One is tall and dark hair, pale skin. The other one is shorter with lighter skin and blonde hair. I recognize the tall dark one, she is a friend of mine, or we were friends but it ended strangely and abruptly and I still have feelings of sadness, frustration and hurt around it. So, I see them strolling through this open marketplace and pretend not to see them - I put my face down and go back to work and put my hand up over my face. However, they stop right in front of my table anyway and when I look up, the tall dark-haired one says hello and seems to be very happy to see me. I\\u2019m a little bit cautious and wary and say hello and ask how they are and what do they want? nicely but I don\\u2019t feel particularly warm towards them. However, they persist and the tall dark-haired one invites me to go with them just to continue wandering around outside. It is such a nice day. I actually say okay. Part of me is warming up to her, but part of me still wants to say, hey you ghosted me, why are you even talking to me now? We start wandering through the marketplace and we go into shops and out of shops. I think we both already had our coffee or beverages, but we wander around getting gelato and some other things. At one point, she hands me a ring. I look at the ring, it\\u2019s very simple, I think there\\u2019s just a couple of stones in it, and I don\\u2019t remember what the stones are. It fits on my finger, which is rare because I have larger fingers. It\\u2019s lovely and I love rings, so I wear the ring. We continue to walk around and at what point we walk past this group of my other high school friends who are out on a lawn doing a bootcamp style workout. I introduced my taller friend and my shorter friend to the friends of mine who are doing this bootcamp. For whatever reason, I am struggling to remember the shorter blonde friend\\u2019s name, even though I know it, I\\u2019m having the hardest time in the introduction. I keep beating around the bush hoping she\\u2019ll just introduce herself, which she doesn\\u2019t and it just feels awkward and I eventually give it up as a bad job because I just can\\u2019t remember her name. After the awkward introductions we join them in their bootcamp. They\\u2019re doing abs. And so we all get into a hollow rock and I show them how to do a hollow rock with good technique. Then that\\u2019s done and we all get up. The tall friend and shorter friend and I continue on our way. Now we\\u2019re out from the marketplace and we\\u2019re in a slightly wooded area, but we\\u2019re walking through a corridor where there are no trees - the trees are on either side of us. It\\u2019s warm, so they\\u2019re all green and in full leaf and it\\u2019s a grassy area - it\\u2019s not a path, it\\u2019s wider than a path - that we\\u2019re walking through. In the distance, I can see there\\u2019s a cage and there\\u2019s people in it and there\\u2019s also all this light glinting off of metal. This metal looks like a wave or when a bird flaps its wings or when you watch a bunch of birds flying together or a school of fish and they all move together at the same time. As I get closer, we can see that it is indeed people, but instead of hands they have butcher knives and that\\u2019s the metal that the light is being glinted off of. They\\u2019re moving all in unison as a wave, doing some sort of dance in this cage, which is rather tightly packed and they\\u2019re managing not to cut themselves. However in my mind I\\u2019m thinking they must be rather dangerous because they are in a cage and they have butcher knives for hands. They are all men in business suits. We continue on after watching them for a little bit and there\\u2019s another cage right past this one. In this cage the people all have scissors for hands, kind of like Edward Scissorhands, the movie. We go by, but one of them calls out to us and stops us and tells my taller friend to give him some of the pearls that she has. She has two pearls and so she gives two of them. We watch as somehow with these scissor hands he makes two pearl earrings. He also has some other pieces that go with the pearls, so these earrings become rather big like a larger stone at the bottom and the pearl at the top, and he\\u2019s somehow managing to make these while we\\u2019re standing there. They are absolutely beautiful. He has scissor hands, he\\u2019s still doing it and we\\u2019re not sure how this is happening, but he makes this beautiful pair of earrings reaching through the bars of the cage this whole time. No one has been let out of any cages. She takes the earrings when he\\u2019s done and we continue on. It\\u2019s the most strange thing. We move past these cages and now we\\u2019re in a home of sorts. We\\u2019re all wanting a shower, it\\u2019s been hot out. So we go through this little shower that is part of this home - the rest of the home I don\\u2019t see at all. I just see that the shower is all tile and it\\u2019s the small 1x1 tile squares. They\\u2019re all a dark grey, but also translucent - kind of reminds me of labradorite, but instead of blues and greens, it\\u2019s greys. I drop my ring in the shower somewhere and I\\u2019m so upset about it. I want to find it. The two friends have gone on ahead of me. I was the last one in and they have wandered off somewhere. Now I\\u2019m on hands and knees looking for this ring. It\\u2019s kind of gross because the floor of the shower is covered in hair. The shower is for anyone to use even though it\\u2019s in a home, so who knows what I\\u2019m crawling through and I\\u2019m really grossed out. On the other hand I\\u2019m really fascinated because every single corner and crevice of this shower has, along with the hair and other gross stuff, a bunch of different beautiful rings. None of them look like the one I dropped which I\\u2019m getting upset about because it was given to me by this friend, but they\\u2019re all gorgeous. They all have different stones in them. They\\u2019re all different sizes. Some of them are the kind where they incase your entire finger. Some of them are very simple - one little golden band with a tiny little opal heart. One of them has gold shaped up and around and sticks up off your finger. They\\u2019re just amazing and I\\u2019m picking up all these rings. This other pair of women come in. As I\\u2019m picking up all these rings I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cthese are beautiful and I\\u2019m going to keep some of them, but also I really want to find mine.\\u201d But this other pair of women come in and start looking for a ring they\\u2019ve lost and I don\\u2019t want to show them all the ones I have, but they start crawling around on the ground and they\\u2019re picking up rings, too. So eventually we compare rings. She finds the one she\\u2019s looking for. I don\\u2019t find mine, but I find others. I\\u2019m really sort of heartbroken about this. At this point I take the rings I want and I go out the backdoor of this shower place and I meet up with my two friends who have been waiting for me. We continue on and now we\\u2019re in some place that looks like the pictures I\\u2019ve seen of Merikesh where there\\u2019s lots of stone everywhere and stone arches and they\\u2019re lighter in color. We\\u2019re walking through and I\\u2019m beginning to get sad because I know our time is coming to an end and both friends are going to leave and I still haven\\u2019t found the ring even though I\\u2019ve got ones that I like. I know that I have no idea when I\\u2019ll see either of these friends again and it\\u2019s making me a little upset. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I am in a hotel room of some sort. I can see the curtains with the air conditioner underneath and the bed that\\u2019s all made up the way they do in hotel rooms with neatly turned corners and tons of pillows. My ex-husband is with me in the hotel room. We are exes. He has his own girlfriend now and our kids are around somewhere with us; I\\u2019m not sure where - the rest of the hotel room is not clear. But I am so horny I cannot help myself. I\\u2019m feeling these waves of disgust because I\\u2019m contemplating asking my ex to have sex with me even though I really don\\u2019t like him. I\\u2019m observing myself just having this torn feeling between really needing to have sex and really not wanting to have sex with my ex. I hear myself at one point say, \\u201cWell, he has a girlfriend now, so that wouldn\\u2019t be good, but maybe if he just wears a condom.\\u201d The feelings that move through me in the dream and in real life that I\\u2019m still so disgusted for even contemplating it and yet am still really torn - all of that arises in the dream and that\\u2019s the only part of the dream I remember.\"],[\"I am at my place of work and I really enjoy where I am. It has a really bright and light feeling. I can\\u2019t see exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I can\\u2019t exactly see the people around me, but I know I like them and I know that where I am feels really good. I feel like I have purpose. I feel very open and excited to do it. I have two other work engagements and I\\u2019m not as excited about either of those, but I know it\\u2019s time for me to move to my second job, so I leave this light and bright place. I go into this hardware store that\\u2019s kind of dingy and smells metallic like hardware stores do with the little mix of oil. It\\u2019s very dim lighting with fluorescent lights over the top hanging low in the ceiling but only half of them work. I can\\u2019t tell exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I think I\\u2019m organizing nuts and bolts or cleaning something out. I know I\\u2019m greasy and dirty. The woman I\\u2019m working for, the owner, is there. She\\u2019s a mother and she has these two boys that aren\\u2019t hers but they\\u2019re in her care somehow. She also has a baby with her and at one point the baby is needing care and she has a fish she\\u2019s caught. The fish needs to be filleted and cooked and somehow I\\u2019m the one who knows how to do that. So I fillet the fish and I can see the individual muscles - the layers - the way a fish fillet is layered. The baby seems to be sickly and crying and is sitting in a carrier to my right. I fillet this fish and cook it and then take one of the layers off and give it to the baby to eat. This baby seems to be 5 or 6 months old, so it seems kind of strange that I\\u2019m giving it fish, but it seems to be what it needs. There\\u2019s this overall air of sadness and grief, like this baby is going to die anyway even if I give it this nourishing fish. Then I\\u2019m back speaking with the mother and she\\u2019s asking me to keep an eye on her two boys that aren\\u2019t really hers, but she\\u2019s taking care of. I go with the boys to her house. One boy goes in the house and stays in the house and one boy stays out. They\\u2019re twins and one is not allowed inside the house, the other is. The father doesn\\u2019t let the other one in. I\\u2019m watching the two of them and as I\\u2019m watching one boy cross over this threshold and the other stay behind, this group or gang of boys from the neighborhood come. They have some sort of laundry detergent or white powder they\\u2019ve picked up from the hardware store. They throw it into the eyes of both of the boys because neither of the boys are really the children of the family - that seems to be the reason anyway. The one boy who\\u2019s allowed in the house starts to cry and he\\u2019s screaming and he\\u2019s trying to clean the powder off his face. He gets taken care of - someone in the house takes care of him, washes his eyes out. The boy that\\u2019s not allowed in the house is crying and screaming and I go to take care of him. But I\\u2019m not allowed to take care of him. Someone else is taking him. And now some time has passed and I\\u2019m standing in the bedroom - it\\u2019s an upstairs bedroom. I\\u2019m looking out the window, and to my left is the boy allowed in the house. He\\u2019s on the bed and has bandages over his eyes. As I\\u2019m looking out this second or third story window, I\\u2019m looking out at this outdoor shed or barn and it has a huge human size cage hanging from it and the other boy is in it and his eyes are bandaged. It looks like they tried to make it comfortable for him to lay down, but it is a wire cage that\\u2019s rested. He\\u2019s lying down trying to convalesce. Then all of a sudden I remember I still never went to my third job, which was working for my mother, and I really don\\u2019t want to do that. She has been calling me this whole time reminding me that I owed her - that I was supposed to show up, that I\\u2019m supposed to be there, that I\\u2019m supposed to do this work for her. I would answer the call and talk to her, then put the phone down and promptly forget that I was supposed to be there. And now it\\u2019s time for me to go and I don\\u2019t go. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a coffee shop and I see a friend of mine who is working there. I haven\\u2019t seen her for a while. I ask if she wants to hang out but it feels strange. She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it\\u2019s not very big, there\\u2019s not a lot of space. She\\u2019s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I\\u2019m asking her while she\\u2019s busy, and it\\u2019s not that she doesn\\u2019t want to hang out. The scene changes and I\\u2019m in a residential area of a town and I\\u2019m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I\\u2019m walking up a hill and she\\u2019s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I\\u2019m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She\\u2019s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It\\u2019s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don\\u2019t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They\\u2019re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I\\u2019m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It\\u2019s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there\\u2019s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there\\u2019s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I\\u2019m a little bit wary because there\\u2019s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don\\u2019t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don\\u2019t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I\\u2019m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It\\u2019s actually another sort of twilight, but it\\u2019s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it\\u2019s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I\\u2019m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it\\u2019s cordial. Suddenly he\\u2019s talking to me like we\\u2019re still lovers. I\\u2019m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle.\\u201d The voice is also telling me, \\u201cYou can still be kind, you can still be kind.\\u201d So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he\\u2019s going to take me with him. So we\\u2019ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there\\u2019s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It\\u2019s where he lives. He has an apartment. He\\u2019s very very familiar with me and I\\u2019m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He\\u2019s a surfer and he\\u2019s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he\\u2019s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I\\u2019m actually quite glad that he\\u2019s going. So again, I\\u2019m being as encouraging as possible. I\\u2019m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don\\u2019t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I\\u2019m just sending him off for a little bit and then he\\u2019ll be back. But in my mind I\\u2019m sending him off like he\\u2019s going off on a quest and I won't\\u2019 see him for a long while. I\\u2019m relieved that I wont\\u2019 see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he\\u2019s really proud of. I\\u2019m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he\\u2019s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I\\u2019m satisfied with how I\\u2019ve handled all of it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people - I know some of them, they\\u2019re acquaintances that I\\u2019ve met here where I live, but we\\u2019re not close. We\\u2019ve met up and we\\u2019re going to a concert, but it\\u2019s music I don\\u2019t know or I don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not excited about it, but it\\u2019s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There\\u2019s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it\\u2019s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we\\u2019re listening, and I\\u2019m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I\\u2019ve met them before or they\\u2019re from some era of my past. We\\u2019re listening and while we\\u2019re listening there\\u2019s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it\\u2019s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m just sewing away and now it\\u2019s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can\\u2019t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I\\u2019m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don\\u2019t tangle my threads and it\\u2019s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I\\u2019m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I\\u2019ve been in a bowling alley. There\\u2019s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I\\u2019m just watching them bowl and they\\u2019re all having a really good time. It\\u2019s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I\\u2019ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It\\u2019s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it\\u2019s time for me to bowl. It\\u2019s not time because I\\u2019m part of their team or anything; I\\u2019m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I\\u2019m so terrible at it. It\\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. So, I\\u2019m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there\\u2019s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it\\u2019s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can\\u2019t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can\\u2019t go head on or straight. So it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there\\u2019s a person sitting in the way. So it\\u2019s my turn again and I go to him and say, \\u201cCould you please move so I can bowl correctly?\\u201d The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he\\u2019s watching me to see if I\\u2019m going to get it. There\\u2019s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I\\u2019m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it\\u2019s my turn and he\\u2019s not in my way, I go to bowl and it\\u2019s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It\\u2019s the most beautiful bowl you\\u2019ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I only remember a snippet of this dream. I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It\\u2019s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I\\u2019m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It\\u2019s warm so I don\\u2019t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I\\u2019m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I\\u2019ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I\\u2019m headed back in their direction. As I\\u2019m walking down the street, I\\u2019m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There\\u2019s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there\\u2019s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there\\u2019s very tall windows - they\\u2019re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it\\u2019s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I\\u2019m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I\\u2019m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She\\u2019s talking to her daughter. She\\u2019s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there\\u2019s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that\\u2019s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I\\u2019m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I\\u2019m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There\\u2019s an awkwardness now because I don\\u2019t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She\\u2019s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I\\u2019ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I\\u2019m wearing doesn\\u2019t have any pockets and I also suddenly can\\u2019t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I\\u2019m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I\\u2019m so distraught and I wonder if it\\u2019s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don\\u2019t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It\\u2019s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There\\u2019s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody\\u2019s birthday, I\\u2019m not sure whose. Maybe we\\u2019re celebrating everybody\\u2019s birthday. We\\u2019re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There\\u2019s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we\\u2019re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I\\u2019m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I\\u2019m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I\\u2019ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s this man I want you to meet.\\u201d She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it\\u2019s Cyril or something but I don\\u2019t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I\\u2019m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I\\u2019m at her home and it\\u2019s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We\\u2019re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis is the person I want you to meet.\\u201d He\\u2019s got this leather jacket and his hair is longish and curly or wavy and dark. Yes, he\\u2019s definitely good looking, but all my alarm bells are going off because he\\u2019s riding a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket - how cliche. And he\\u2019s got tattoos. She says, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s a plant medicine maker, so he knows how to make medicine from plants.\\u201d That peaks my interest because you don\\u2019t meet a lot of men who know how to do that. But I\\u2019m still feeling like I\\u2019m being put on the spot and I don't appreciate matchmaking. It feels awkward because I know he\\u2019s been invited there to meet with me. I don\\u2019t like those kind of situations. I would much rather there be an organic conversation where you\\u2019ve met or something. In this part of the dream I am feeling so awkward with meeting this guy. But I\\u2019m still feeling tender feelings for my friend - I still love her very much and I don't care that she\\u2019s set me up with this dude. I think it\\u2019s kind of funny. Anyway, I\\u2019m not into it. In the next part of the dream, I\\u2019m taking him and a couple friends on a tour. The dream switches scenes again. Now I\\u2019ve left my friend who has done the introductions, but this guy is with me. He\\u2019s off the motorcycle at this point and there are other guys with him. They\\u2019re his friends, I think, but they\\u2019re all strangers to me. I\\u2019m giving them a tour of what I think is my old high school, but it\\u2019s in the snow and my old high school was in Hawaii. So this version of my high school is somewhere in the snow - there\\u2019s lots of ice. We get in a car and I\\u2019m driving them up and around the drive that usually takes us to the school. We drive past the chapel part I grew up going to, past the admissions building. I\\u2019m taking them onto campus because these guys are all going to run a race. So it\\u2019s a bunch of hotshot runners or super athletic guys. Again I\\u2019m asking myself, \\u201cWhy am I with all these guys? Why am I showing them around?\\u201d So we actually end up driving past the beginning of the race and we have to go park way down below in a parking lot. To get to the beginning of the race is a ton of stairs covered in snow and ice. Now because it took a while to drive around, school has let out, so there\\u2019s a bunch of students out and it\\u2019s really really crowded. So these men I\\u2019m leading around are getting a little bit frustrated because it\\u2019s taking extra long to get to the race. They\\u2019re worried they\\u2019re going to miss it - it\\u2019s a running, cross country race. It\\u2019s cold and they\\u2019re in their running shorts - not my problem. I lead them up to the beginning of the race through all these stairs. We\\u2019re winding our ways through the crowds, being careful not to slip on the ice. The headmaster of the school comes to greet us. What\\u2019s interesting is that the school now has a ton of people of color going to it, including black people, but these guys I\\u2019m bringing with me are all white. This is interesting because I\\u2019m noticing as we\\u2019re walking through the crowd, the guys I\\u2019m leading are being rude. They\\u2019re totally trying to use their white male dominance to move themselves through this crowd. They\\u2019re pissing a lot of people off. So the headmaster meets me, and the headmaster in this dream is actually the head of the Waldorf School my kids currently go to now. Her name is Cecilia and she\\u2019s a woman of color. She meets me and helps me lead these men to the start of the race. But she is giving them a lecture on white male privilege, dominance, the patriarchy and their atrocious behavior. There\\u2019s a part of me rubbing my hands in glee, getting to listen to Cecilia school these men who have been incredibly arrogant. We get to the start of the race, which is interesting, because it\\u2019s actually through a bunch of buildings and they have to race through a bunch of doorways before they can get outside. It\\u2019s literally doorways and Cecilia has had me go open up some of the doors so they know which doors to go through. I mark them somehow, so there\\u2019s literally a little note that says, \\u201cRun through this door,\\u201d so they can find their way to the outside, because there is an outside part of this race, but it literally starts in a building and they have to run through these doorways. Now Cecilia has been joined by a male teacher of color who is continuing the lesson and lecture for these white men who are all still in their running gear - short shorts, tennis shoes, a sweater because it\\u2019s cold. They are finishing up this lecture and the white men are part of this other group. The other group has people of color in it. They\\u2019re not in the front to start this race. I really don't know how it\\u2019s going to go because everyone has to run through these doors and these doors are not lined up one after the other. You run through a door, then you have to hang a right to go through another door. It\\u2019s quite maze-like until you get out. But they\\u2019re all set up, ready to go, and the lecturing is done. Sure enough, somebody shoots off one of those little start guns and they start running through. The dream ends there.\"],[\"The first one is me someplace warm, at least I\\u2019m wearing a tanktop and shorts. I have protectors around me and I don't feel I\\u2019m in danger, but I do feel I\\u2019m new. I\\u2019m learning some things, so I need guidance and someone or something to keep an eye on me and that\\u2019s exactly what I have. I\\u2019m actually learning to fly and to use some of my other superpowers. So my two protectors are there to show me how to do the things and make sure I don\\u2019t hurt myself. One is golden in color and I keep seeing a lion or mountain lion as the shape of this particular protector, but they tend to shapeshift into human form, too. When this lion or mountain lion is in human form, it\\u2019s a male with blonde/gold hair and green eyes and nicely chiseled body. The other protector is a black jaguar with wings. It has big black wings on it and it flies around and shows me how to fly - that\\u2019s one of the things I\\u2019m trying to learn. I keep seeing places that look very similar to my childhood home in this dream. I\\u2019m on a balcony and this balcony reminds me of the balcony that was outside my parents\\u2019 bedroom. The view from it looks like the view from my house which is looking out onto a lava rock desert that\\u2019s got dried grasses and smaller shrubs growing. The grasses are all golden in color, too. I\\u2019m aware of my protectors\\u2019 presence. I do see them fly off on occasion, go take care of things and come back. I\\u2019m just observing the whole time, trying to figure out how to fly, myself. I\\u2019m aware that they are going off to fight things, then they come back. I\\u2019m a little concerned because I don\\u2019t want them to get hurt, but they seem to be fine every time. Then the dream shifts a little bit to another spot where I\\u2019m walking across and open space - kind of a grassy space, but I can feel there are other things around me like maybe trees and possibly houses, but I\\u2019m not completely aware of what is around me. I just know there is enough space for me to practice my flying and I\\u2019m in human form for this. I start walking and the black jaguar is with me. He\\u2019s encouraging me not to start flying, but I\\u2019m not really listening and doing it anyway. So I start running as fast as I can, and sure enough, I take a leap and it launches me into the air. I start flying up and up and up. I can control it. I can direct it. I can make myself go in the direction I want to go in. One of the guardians is with me flying - I can't tell which one. I\\u2019m doing a really good job of flying around. I have a particular direction I head - it\\u2019s towards a taller apartment complex. I\\u2019m heading there because there's a particular balcony I want to land on but I can\\u2019t remember why or what I\\u2019m doing. But I have purpose, I just don\\u2019t remember what it is. I\\u2019m mostly impressed that I am actually flying because it seems there are so many dreams when you want to fly and you run and run and run but never get off the ground. But in this one I do. Then a couple dream segments go by, which I can\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s totally shifted now. I\\u2019m in a cave and this cave is also a bar. There\\u2019s a huge dance party going on, like a rave. I have no idea why I\\u2019m there because I don\\u2019t do raves and I don\\u2019t drink. It\\u2019s also late and I don\\u2019t like to stay up late. The people in this rave are all my high school classmates and they are the last people I want to see. I don\\u2019t want to interact with them. I don\\u2019t want to know what they\\u2019ve all been doing for the last 20 years because I definitely feel I won\\u2019t have anything cool to share and there will be a lot of judgment around where I find myself currently in terms of accomplishments in life. I also have a very thick layer of judgment around the fact that they all still drink together and that\\u2019s what they do, and their friendship is based on having drank alcohol for the last 20 years and that just in no way excites me. I don\\u2019t want to be around it. So as I\\u2019m in this crowd, I\\u2019m making sure to avoid all my classmates and not be seen by them. I\\u2019m trying to get out of the cave so I can be outside because the cave is dark and imposing. I don\\u2019t want to be in that kind of place - it\\u2019s too heavy. I want to be out where there\\u2019s sunshine and fresh air. So I make my way out. My hair is down and I\\u2019m wearing shorter shorts and a crop top. I do seem to be dressed for clubbing, but I\\u2019m not into it. I make my way out of the cave - the cave is where the dancing is happening - and on my way out is where the bar is. First I pass a little waterfall that\\u2019s coming down this rock cliff. The cave is all rock, but the entrance is also rock and it\\u2019s open on one side, but there\\u2019s rock on the other. The side that has the rock wall is where the bar is. I\\u2019m wanting to go past the bar because I can see above this rock wall, it shifts into green grass that goes up an incline for quite a ways. Beyond the green grass, I can see forest is starting. I want to head up that way. I can also see that halfway up this hill, there\\u2019s a ton of people milling about. It\\u2019s almost like this grassy area and hill is a tourist destination that people climb up to go see. It reminds me of the Tor in England, but it\\u2019s definitely not a sacred site in that way. Halfway up this hill is a plateau with a round circle that reminds me of a caldera - the inside of a volcano. Inside is a bunch of workout bikes, like exercise bikes. I want to go up there and go get some exercise in. So I can see my destination - I can see where I want to go. But I have to get past this bar and all of my classmates first. I can see that the wall of the bar which is all rock similar to the cave is kind of consuming people. I can see it curl in and it doesn\\u2019t eat them or kill them, but they never really come out once it curls up and over them. I can see this happening, so I want to get out as quick as I can. But I have to go past and the last group of people on my way out is all my classmates. I\\u2019m just watching them and staying pretty hidden because it\\u2019s very easy for me to pull a veil over me. Even though I\\u2019m very noticable, I\\u2019ve pulled a veil around me and they can't see me. So I\\u2019m just observing and watching as they\\u2019re drinking and dancing and yelling at each other. It seems like they\\u2019re having a good time, but I still don\\u2019t want any part of it. One of my friends from high school - a particular classmate who happens to be in my dreams pretty often - she\\u2019s the bartender and she is singing and rapping and entertaining everyone while they\\u2019re dancing. I\\u2019m really just wanting to scooch by and all of a sudden I realize I don't have my phone and my phone is somewhere back in that cave. I don\\u2019t want to go back in it because I see that now the cave is somehow consuming people and I don\\u2019t want to do that. But I catch this friend\\u2019s eye and she sees that I\\u2019m trying to get out. She seems cool with it and I tell her I can\\u2019t go because I don't have my phone. She says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. I\\u2019ll go get it.\\u201d She goes in to get it. Meanwhile, I\\u2019m watching the rest of my friends dance, but also disappear. I can see that the rock wall of the bar is coming up and it\\u2019s cresting over me like a wave. There is water under me. I have to dive down as fast as I can and dive forward as fast as I can to get out in front of this rock wave that\\u2019s curling. I do, but of course I\\u2019m totally panicked. It only takes me once and I\\u2019m in front. My friend shows up and hands me my phone and I can leave. I get out of there as fast as I can, leaving all my friends having a great time partying. I\\u2019m at this point completely panicked because I\\u2019ve almost been consumed. I get out of there as fast as I can and head up towards the green. While I\\u2019m on my way out, this couple introduces themselves to me. They come out of nowhere. They don\\u2019t speak English and I don\\u2019t speak their language, but somehow we are communicating and talking. They want to introduce me to their son or daughter whoever it is. But I\\u2019m so desperate to get out at this point that i say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to meet you, and I hope you enjoy your visit here.\\u201d They\\u2019re visiting and somehow I know this even though neither of us are speaking each other\\u2019s language. Then the dream shifts to a grocery store parking lot. I\\u2019m showing up there because there\\u2019s some sort of meeting like an AA meeting, or a meeting of people coming together for a particular cause, but it\\u2019s one of those info sessions then they try to sell you something. I\\u2019m standing there trying to gather the information and feeling this information is really important. In the end I realize they are just trying to get me to join their church or cult or whatever it is. It\\u2019s something I don't want to join and I\\u2019m so disappointed that I wasted my time standing in this parking lot when I could have been doing something else. I get in my car and drive away. Then the dream shifts to something else but I don\\u2019t remember it.\"],[\"Just a few snippets of dream: one is an outside battle of sorts happening. There\\u2019s some forces that are trying to wipe me and my companions out. I\\u2019m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I\\u2019m responsible as I\\u2019m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it\\u2019s a general feeling of protecting, but I\\u2019m not sure who I\\u2019m protecting. It\\u2019s not anyone in particular, it\\u2019s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don\\u2019t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don\\u2019t even know what's coming for us, I\\u2019m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we\\u2019re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that\\u2019s coming towards us. So whatever it is that\\u2019s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn\\u2019t last. As the battle continues, it\\u2019s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can\\u2019t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don\\u2019t know and his friend who I also don\\u2019t know. The first group I\\u2019m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they\\u2019re getting a tour of a ranch. I\\u2019m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also has an herb garden where they\\u2019re allowed to gather some herbs as souvenirs. I am down there with them. There\\u2019s chives or green onions that we\\u2019re growing but they\\u2019ve dried somehow. So you can pick them up and take the dried chives with you. There\\u2019s also lemongrass and a bunch of herbs and people are able to gather them. I\\u2019m gathering them and working the ranch - that\\u2019s my role. I\\u2019m part of the tour but I also have work to do on this ranch to keep it going. The man is the owner of the ranch and there are a ton of other people who work on the ranch with separate roles. There\\u2019s a bookkeeper and all these other people that I don\\u2019t know who have roles and do a lot of planning for the tours or parties that come through, they do this man\\u2019s finances and just sort of run things for him. I\\u2019m mostly a little worker bee out on the land. So this group of people comes and goes and I'm getting the feeling this is a regular stop on a tour. Then the scene shifts a little bit from daytime to evening. The man is in the carriage thing and he asks me to go for a ride with him. His friend is driving the carriage. I get in and we head down the driveway like we\\u2019re going to leave the ranch. There's a place where the road turns and on the right hand side there\\u2019s a huge mud pit. You can see old tire tracks in it, but I\\u2019m really concerned because if the carriage falls into this mud pit, it is never coming out. I\\u2019m watching the friend struggle a little bit. He\\u2019s really close to the edge and I\\u2019m concerned. He has all my attention even though this other man who I\\u2019m sitting in the carriage with doesn\\u2019t seem to be concerned at all. He\\u2019s keeping a conversation going with me and I have one mind on the conversation with him and one mind on the fact that this carriage could get really stuck and fall off into the gigantic mud pit. I finally say something to this man and he says not to worry. At this point, the carriage turns itself around so I can see the entrance of the ranch with this big sign. It dawns on me that the whole reason for the driver to have been going so close to the mud pit was a distraction technique so that I wouldn\\u2019t turn behind me and see what they were doing to the sign on the ranch. When the driver finally does turn the carriage around, I see the sign on the ranch and it\\u2019s a marriage proposal from this man in the carriage. I\\u2019m so confused because this man is essentially my boss all the time and we don\\u2019t have any relationship that I know of and all the people that work for him have been changing out this sign and preparing this whole thing. I\\u2019m a little bit speechless and really confused and thinking that there\\u2019s another person this man would rather be with. I remember sort of sitting in the carriage going: \\u201cWell let\\u2019s try some things out and see how we work together.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a large house with two stories. I think it's my ex-husband\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m not sure. He\\u2019s there or his presence is felt at least, but I don\\u2019t actually see him. There is an upstairs bedroom with a crib in it. There are two babies in it. One of the babies is mine or I gave birth to it. I can\\u2019t tell. It\\u2019s about a year and half and I have this knowing that I left it when it was younger and I\\u2019m coming back now. I\\u2019m not sure why I\\u2019m coming back. I just know that when I see this baby in the cradle that it needs nourishment - it needs feeding. So I bring it to my breast to nurse it. I\\u2019m worried that ti didn\\u2019t get all the nutrients it needed when it was younger. So while I\\u2019m nursing it, I can feel that it\\u2019s a relief for me somehow - like when you get engorged it is taking the pressure off my chest, out of my breast and the baby is getting what it needs. But the whole time I have this sense of sorrow or sadness like I had perhaps abandoned the baby or there was some reason why I wasn\\u2019t able to be with the baby when it was younger and I\\u2019m only coming back now to tend it now that it\\u2019s a year and a half. As I nurse the baby I can feel the relief in my chest and my breasts. It\\u2019s sucking hard like it\\u2019s desperate to get what I have for itself. This is the only part of the dream I remember; there are other pieces, but those are gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It\\u2019s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we\\u2019re on our way to the place. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s a road that\\u2019s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We\\u2019re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there\\u2019s a ravine under us. We\\u2019re headed to a cave where we\\u2019re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it\\u2019s like - it\\u2019s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I\\u2019m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there\\u2019s water that\\u2019s swirling around the rocks. It\\u2019s so fun because we\\u2019re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I\\u2019m floating and we\\u2019re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We\\u2019re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it\\u2019s smooth and flat. It\\u2019s still light in a sense, it\\u2019s not full daylight. We can still see. It\\u2019s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we\\u2019re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It\\u2019s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I\\u2019ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it\\u2019s very particular, it\\u2019s something I asked for. Then it\\u2019s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I\\u2019m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that\\u2019s everywhere and the flowers - they\\u2019re gathering them. It\\u2019s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There\\u2019s now a table. There\\u2019s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she\\u2019s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they\\u2019re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we\\u2019re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we\\u2019re carrying bags of trash because we\\u2019ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we\\u2019re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn\\u2019t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. It\\u2019s evening time. I am walking around a college campus. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who\\u2019s with me, but it\\u2019s another woman. I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She\\u2019s beautiful. She\\u2019s a little bit sad - she\\u2019s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she\\u2019s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it\\u2019s like an artist studio. It\\u2019s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She\\u2019s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there\\u2019s not much room. We\\u2019re hanging out with her and I\\u2019m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn\\u2019t even have a bathroom and I don\\u2019t think it has a kitchen area - it\\u2019s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She\\u2019s still really, really sad. I\\u2019m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she\\u2019s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend\\u2019s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There\\u2019s a little tension between them, like a depression. They\\u2019re together but they\\u2019re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don\\u2019t know why. They\\u2019re talking and there\\u2019s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it\\u2019s going to be fine - let\\u2019s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it\\u2019s full dark now. There\\u2019s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He\\u2019s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he\\u2019s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He\\u2019s kind of got a belly. He just doesn\\u2019t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there\\u2019s other college kids lingering around. There\\u2019s stuff happening and I\\u2019m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I\\u2019m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It\\u2019s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don\\u2019t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they\\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\\u2019s very orderly. It\\u2019s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they\\u2019re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it\\u2019s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I\\u2019m watching these people come and go and there\\u2019s this competitive energy in me where I\\u2019m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It\\u2019s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There\\u2019s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who\\u2019s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That\\u2019s the atmosphere that we\\u2019re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We\\u2019re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There\\u2019s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there\\u2019s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it\\u2019s mine. But he\\u2019s holding the baby and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I sort of like holding the baby.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don\\u2019t say anything but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, we should do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we\\u2019ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we\\u2019re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He\\u2019s in a costume of some sort and he\\u2019s asking me if I recognize who he is. I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s familiar but I can\\u2019t quite place it.\\u201d Somebody says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your gloves.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cOh yeah my gloves!\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, your Hans Solo!\\u201d He runs off to get his gloves and I\\u2019m still somehow totally content because we\\u2019re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he\\u2019s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There\\u2019s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he\\u2019s at least 10 years younger - which is why I\\u2019m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it\\u2019s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he\\u2019s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I\\u2019m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It\\u2019s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I\\u2019m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, but we\\u2019re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I\\u2019m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it\\u2019s a spaceship. It\\u2019s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they\\u2019re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I\\u2019m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they\\u2019re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I\\u2019m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I\\u2019m starting to be crushed. So I\\u2019m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It\\u2019s me and my friend, Aila. We\\u2019re in a car together, traveling. It\\u2019s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There\\u2019s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it\\u2019s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He\\u2019s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He\\u2019s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don\\u2019t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he\\u2019s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it\\u2019s the sample. It\\u2019s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that\\u2019s made out of gold and it\\u2019s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who\\u2019s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there\\u2019s something up with these bracelets because the material they\\u2019re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, we all need one of these.\\u201d He\\u2019s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it\\u2019s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that\\u2019s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he\\u2019s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there\\u2019s more, but that's all I can remember right now.\"],[\"Holy crap. This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I\\u2019m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he\\u2019s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he\\u2019s talking with me and he\\u2019s trying to court me. He\\u2019s showing me all the things he\\u2019s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he\\u2019s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he\\u2019s done, he\\u2019s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it\\u2019s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He\\u2019s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It\\u2019s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I\\u2019m in my home now - it\\u2019s not very descriptive, I just know I\\u2019m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn\\u2019t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That\\u2019s my first \\u201coh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn\\u2019t look very safe. She\\u2019s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it\\u2019s falling out. There\\u2019s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it\\u2019s also filthy. She\\u2019s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I\\u2019m offering to make them a meal - I guess they\\u2019re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she\\u2019s wild. She doesn\\u2019t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He\\u2019s just telling her what to do. He\\u2019s literally telling her: \\u201cOkay, now do this, do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s so proud of himself. He thinks he\\u2019s being the best dad. I\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god, your daughter is wrecked.\\u201d I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I\\u2019m with the next man in the lineup. It\\u2019s my ex-husband. He\\u2019s different. He\\u2019s also trying to show me how different he is. He\\u2019s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We\\u2019re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There\\u2019s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we\\u2019re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I\\u2019m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I\\u2019m really excited for their blind date. I\\u2019m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we\\u2019re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they\\u2019re snuggling up. I\\u2019m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it\\u2019s cute, it\\u2019s sweet. There\\u2019s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it\\u2019s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there\\u2019s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: \\u201cCan she do it? Is she strong enough?\\u201d Since he\\u2019s already over my back, he\\u2019s essentially in the fireman\\u2019s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\\u2019t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.\\u201d I realize that that\\u2019s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I\\u2019m with the next man. It\\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you\\u2019re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He\\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We\\u2019re hanging out and i\\u2019s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there\\u2019s also different types of equipment around, too. There\\u2019s these three younger men and they\\u2019re teachers or they\\u2019re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: \\u201cOh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.\\u201d So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We\\u2019ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He\\u2019s so attentive and affectionate. He\\u2019s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he\\u2019s getting agitated and I think that\\u2019s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn\\u2019t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken\\u2019s hat and I\\u2019d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He\\u2019s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5\\u20196\\u201d, I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d and Luke\\u2019s about 6\\u20192\\u201d or 3\\u201d or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It\\u2019s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I\\u2019ve seen you strip.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? I\\u2019ve been stripping?!\\u201d Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, \\u201cOh yeah, I totally did that, but don\\u2019t know what it was for.\\u201d Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you\\u2019re amazing and I didn\\u2019t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, \\u201cWhat, do you think you want my hat back now?\\u201d He\\u2019s saying this like he\\u2019s not going to give it to me and I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m like whatever. I hadn\\u2019t thought of it and it\\u2019s not a big deal to me. We\\u2019re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We\\u2019re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he\\u2019s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it\\u2019s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it\\u2019s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I\\u2019m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he\\u2019s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to be a part of any of them. They all seem so unstable!\\u201d\"],[\"There are three distinct parts to this dream. The first part I remember is a gathering of a lot of women - at least 25 of us. It\\u2019s a retreat and it\\u2019s towards the end of the retreat. It\\u2019s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She\\u2019s been doing a lot of the teaching. I\\u2019ve been in the mix, too. I\\u2019m not a participant, but I\\u2019m there. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m helping out with the retreat or not. She\\u2019s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They\\u2019re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She\\u2019s giving them a speech, more or less, that\\u2019s along the lines of: \\u201cOkay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.\\u201d I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn\\u2019t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else\\u2019s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I\\u2019m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they\\u2019re all complaining. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cDid you not learn anything from what we just did?\\u201d They\\u2019re all holding hands with each other. They\\u2019re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I\\u2019m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that\\u2019s what I should be doing because I\\u2019m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don\\u2019t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave their clothes where they are and I walk away from the clothesline and I walk away from the whole retreat. I am thinking that I need to leave them all to their own devices because they don\\u2019t get it. That\\u2019s the thought going through my head. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m in conversation with my ex-husband about our daughter. It\\u2019s my time with them - we\\u2019re still sharing custody and visiting time. My son is there and he\\u2019s closeby - he\\u2019s with me. But my daughter is not there and I\\u2019m asking my ex where she is. He tells me, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s at her friend Gus or Gum\\u2019s house.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWho is that? I don\\u2019t know who that is.\\u201d He tells me that he is a teammate of hers. She\\u2019s apparently playing soccer and this is her teammate. But she\\u2019s 12 and this boy is a little bit older - that\\u2019s the impression I get. I\\u2019m starting to get pissed off and scared because I don\\u2019t know this kid\\u2019s parents and they live in another county. There\\u2019s a little map flashing before my eyes and the place they live is highlighted and flashing and it\\u2019s far away from where we are - at least a day away by car. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I don\\u2019t know this kid, I don\\u2019t know his parents, I haven\\u2019t talked with my daughter in a long time and I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing and I don\\u2019t trust that she\\u2019s safe. I start yelling at my ex, telling her he can\\u2019t just let her go to places that he doesn\\u2019t know the parents or the situation just because she wants to hang out with a boy, essentially. He doesn\\u2019t get it. His face turns stone cold. I\\u2019m trying to keep my voice even and level. But the more he grey rocks what I say, the louder and frustrated I get until I\\u2019m just yelling at him. I\\u2019m so disgusted with him. His dad is the one driving my daughter down and back and he\\u2019s there. I\\u2019m just as mad and frustrated at him. It feels very much like they\\u2019re stonewalling me and taking my daughter. But they're putting her at risk is what I feel. I'm panicked and so upset but getting no answers from them. I\\u2019m asking them where this boy lives because I want to go pick her up, but they won\\u2019t tell me. So the dreams shifts again and I retain the panic. In the next shift of the dream, I\\u2019m hanging with some friends - some are from high school, some are from this time - other instructors I\\u2019ve met at the pole studio. We\\u2019re all outside. It\\u2019s a bright, beautiful sunny day. We\\u2019re walking down a paved path - it\\u2019s available for a lot of people to walk on. It\\u2019s me and another girl and another guy. Other couples are around me as well. We\\u2019re all walking and there\\u2019s space between the other couples and me and this girl and this guy. I\\u2019m noticing that they\\u2019re starting to hit it off. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m jealous or frustrated. I\\u2019m having an emotional reaction, but not sure. Some of it is that panic has carried over from the last part of the dream. Again I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou guys don\\u2019t really know each other. It\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up right now.\\u201d We all stop walking. We end up at some sort of grassy area. The couples have split off - they have their own blankets. This guy and this girl - there\\u2019s a sense that I know who they are, but I\\u2019m not seeing who they actually are - they split off, too. Everyone gets under a blanket. I\\u2019m watching and can tell that these two are hooking up. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know each other!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at this through the lens of us being in quarantine and I\\u2019m thinking it\\u2019s probably not a good idea to hook up with someone you\\u2019ve just met while we\\u2019re in this quarantine. I\\u2019m just really concerned again. Then somebody passes out bathing suits to all of the women. I\\u2019m watching as all of the women and all these couples put these bathing suits on. They look different on every single woman. It\\u2019s very interesting to see how it\\u2019s the same cut of bathing suit bikini, but looks so different on every single woman. I have one, too, and am trying to put it on. But I\\u2019m putting it on over my clothes and I don\\u2019t understand why I\\u2019m doing that, other than the thought going through my head is that I want the added layer of protection. Everybody else seems a little bit carefree and somewhat nonchalant about the situation we find ourselves in. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve hooked up with their person and it\\u2019s them and their person and they\\u2019re okay. But I\\u2019m by myself. I\\u2019m watching all these couples and the ones that have been together I\\u2019m like, \\u201cyeah okay, they\\u2019re good,\\u201d but the ones that haven't been together, I\\u2019m totally horrified and that sense of not just panic, but a little bit that I\\u2019m in the wrong frequency goes through all the dreams - that I\\u2019m just not in the right timeline. That sense, I woke up with and still feel.\"],[\"I am with a friend but I\\u2019m not actually sure who it is - there\\u2019s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we\\u2019ve known each other for a while. We\\u2019re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don\\u2019t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We\\u2019re walking through a town. We\\u2019re on the streets of the downtown area. It\\u2019s dark - like night time or really early morning. We\\u2019re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that\\u2019s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she\\u2019s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it\\u2019s a room off to the side. I\\u2019m so happy to see her. She\\u2019s such a beautiful soul. And she\\u2019s so happy to see me. She\\u2019s showing me some of the pieces she\\u2019s working on. It\\u2019s an interesting interaction because there\\u2019s this air of how much we love each other and she\\u2019s so excited about all her work and I\\u2019m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They\\u2019re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there\\u2019s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it\\u2019s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she\\u2019s found a different coffee shop. So we\\u2019re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It\\u2019s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I\\u2019m happy to see her, but also not. There\\u2019s a little bit of, \\u201cOh no, I don\\u2019t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me\\u201d (which is what happened in real life). So I\\u2019m kind of glad to see her, but there\\u2019s also part of her that\\u2019s also sort of ignoring me. She\\u2019s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I\\u2019m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I\\u2019m with - the one who I still don\\u2019t know who it is - says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.\\u201d So, we\\u2019re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There\\u2019s a bunch of people at it. They\\u2019ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\\u2019m on vacation. I\\u2019m not doing any business. There\\u2019s no meetings.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWell you know this is a BNI meeting.\\u201d The way these things work is if you\\u2019re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn\\u2019t know that was happening, but it feels like that\\u2019s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that\\u2019s gotten us in the mess we\\u2019re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh D\\u2019s here! Great!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my fucking god, get me out of here now.\\u201d He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn\\u2019t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, \\u201cEh.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw.\\u201d He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cFuck, you can\\u2019t even be neutral. You can\\u2019t even control your body. You\\u2019re in my damn space and I don\\u2019t even want to be here!\\u201d I still haven\\u2019t had any food or coffee, so probably I\\u2019m \\u201changry\\u201d - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don\\u2019t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I\\u2019m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it\\u2019s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it\\u2019s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I\\u2019m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There\\u2019s a pier off to my right. There\\u2019s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He\\u2019s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He\\u2019s also writing stuff out in the sand that they\\u2019re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren\\u2019t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I\\u2019m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There\\u2019s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I\\u2019m noticing them as I\\u2019m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I\\u2019m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party, it\\u2019s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I\\u2019m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m feeling like, \\u201cUh, I don\\u2019t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn\\u2019t feel super good.\\u201d Fear of judgment and all that. I\\u2019m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we\\u2019re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll be back.\\u201d I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019ve never seen before, but it's a house that\\u2019s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I\\u2019m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I\\u2019m at her house, which I don\\u2019t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They\\u2019re talking to me about planning how they\\u2019re going to remodel parts of their house and how it\\u2019s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they\\u2019re going to earn it. I\\u2019m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he\\u2019s one of those ages). They\\u2019re showing me how they\\u2019re going to do it. They\\u2019re really, really friendly - it\\u2019s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there\\u2019s different ways. I\\u2019m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, \\u201cWell, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.\\u201d So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It\\u2019s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.\\u201d Then my friend is like, \\u201cWell I need you to come and do this thing with me.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I\\u2019m feeling torn because I don\\u2019t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there\\u2019s all these crappy t-shirts like you\\u2019d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They\\u2019re on one of those round racks and I\\u2019m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re doing all these things, come do this with me.\\u201d A second friend from the party comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGuess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.\\u201d She\\u2019s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that\\u2019s where I worked. It\\u2019s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.\"],[\"This dream really did not want to stick. I kept trying to call it back and it wouldn\\u2019t come even though I could feel the felt sense of it. There was something good going to happen if I could just get the right thing to happen - if I could just be lucid enough in the dream and follow the thread of what felt good, then something good would happen. I was in a large dance hall and the windows were floor to ceiling with curtains on either side. There\\u2019s bleachers. I\\u2019m sitting on the bleachers and take my shoes off. The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they\\u2019re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don\\u2019t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren\\u2019t there. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you\\u2019d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - \\u201chey go look over there, there\\u2019s all these shoes.\\u201d There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn\\u2019t progress through the dream if I didn\\u2019t find them. And I didn\\u2019t.\"],[\"Dreams are getting weird...I\\u2019m in this dream, but I am an observer. I do not have a body, I am not taking up any space, I am just watching it all happen. There is a black man and his two daughters. He is showing them how to ride trains for free because they\\u2019re really poor and they don\\u2019t have money for a ticket. So he showed them how to get on these subway trains for free and ride where you need to ride it. They\\u2019re riding on the outside of the train. His daughters are maybe 9 and 11 or maybe 11 or 14. I\\u2019m watching them. I\\u2019m not even on the train. I\\u2019m watching from outside the train. This train is underground, kind of like a subway because there are walls around it and me. They\\u2019re on this train and it\\u2019s going in one direction. They are on a trip and traveling cross-country. But his daughters get very fearless and bold. They decide to do train hopping and take what he\\u2019s taught them and get on any train they want. Sure enough, they\\u2019re on this train and they see another train passing them and going in the opposite direction. They were heading one direction because they were heading across the country and then the daughters hop trains and the father is upset. He says, \\u201cHey don\\u2019t do that, now we\\u2019re going in the wrong direction plus you could kill yourselves.\\u201d But it\\u2019s too late. The daughters are already on another train, so he has to hop it and get on with them, so he doesn\\u2019t lose them. So he gets on this other train. Now they go from being on top of the train down inside the train where there\\u2019s other people. There are all kinds of other people on this train. All kinds of ethnicities, races. It\\u2019s a mix of white, black, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander - everybody and all kinds. They\\u2019re all quirky people. They have their own idiosyncrasies. They\\u2019re each working through some sort of story - they\\u2019re living their own personal story out on this train and they\\u2019re kind of interacting with each other, but it\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re bouncing off of each other. The interactions aren\\u2019t particularly conscious. It\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re each doing their own thing. They run into each other and it\\u2019s sort of like a pinball where their actions, thoughts and stories are mainly about themselves, but they bounce off each other and have an interaction. In particular, there\\u2019s a couple that I can see and am following - a white man with a mustache and shorter hair and with his partner/wife - I can\\u2019t tell what kind of relationship they\\u2019re in. The dad and the two daughters are in the mix now. I\\u2019m watching them. Now that the direction they\\u2019re going has now changed completely, he\\u2019s realizing they need clothes and supplies and food. They\\u2019re going around the train and getting some supplies. Everybody is pretty friendly and are like, \\u201cYeah, we all don\\u2019t have a lot, but here I have this one coat or this shirt.\\u201d It seems like everybody on this train doesn\\u2019t have a lot of money, but they do have some resources. Everything they\\u2019re offering up has been well-used. But the daughters need clothes, shoes and food. And the dad\\u2019s like, yeah I could use a jacket. So everybody is offering what they\\u2019ve got. Then back to this one man with this woman. He\\u2019s wearing a flannel shirt that\\u2019s opened and jeans with rips. He knows what he\\u2019s wanting to do - he\\u2019s very focused. The train has now gone out from a tunnel to outside. I can see outside now. I\\u2019m in the train and outside the train, both simultaneously. I\\u2019m observing what\\u2019s happening in the train and outside of the train. So the train is outside and stops suddenly. Part of the tracks go through this person\\u2019s yard. Their yard looks like a big farm. The train dead stops in the middle. My thought when I see that is, \\u201cUgh, how inconvenient to have a train in the middle of your front lawn. Then all the people start getting off the train. They\\u2019re milling about the lawn of this farm. It\\u2019s a big property. Then some of the people are going into the farmhouse and I\\u2019m watching them wondering, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s the owner of this house? They're probably not going to like this.\\u201d Then that one man and the woman go into the house and they start looking for supplies. I see this other man, he\\u2019s a big beefy burly man, almost like a bodybuilder type guy. He\\u2019s with a woman, too, and she\\u2019s really big, maybe 200lbs and she has a backpack on. They see that the farmer has a horse that\\u2019s in the front lawn and they climb up on the horse to ride it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that horse\\u2019s back is going to break. That\\u2019s too much weight - bodybuilder, large woman plus backpack.\\u201d I see the horse walking, then trotting, then galloping. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d The horse is fighting the whole time. The farmer comes out and yells at them to get off his horse, which is something I would have done. But the thought that registers in my brain is: \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe they know how to ride a horse.\\u201d With the whole bodybuilding persona, it doesn\\u2019t seem like something they would know how to do. Then I go back to the inside of this house where this other man is - the one with the mustache. He has found jewelry making supplies and he\\u2019s making jewelry. It\\u2019s gorgeous, raw stones and he\\u2019s soldering the silver. He\\u2019s making a pendant. It\\u2019s not his supplies, but the farmer\\u2019s that he found in this house. I can see this happening through a sliding glass door. Then I am inside the house. This black man and his daughters are in there, too, and they\\u2019re rummaging for food. The other people on the train are milling about, too, doing all kinds of things. The train has stopped because it\\u2019s stuck. But eventually, you hear the conductor yelling, \\u201cHey, the train is back together. You need to get on. We\\u2019re going to go. We\\u2019re going to continue on.\\u201d So some of the people get back on the train, and some of the people are like, \\u201cNo, we like it here. We\\u2019re going to stay here.\\u201d (not necessarily in the farmhouse, but in this area). The train continues on in its direction while another train passes in the opposite direction. I think the black man and his daughters get on the train going the opposite direction so they can get back to where they had originally set out to go to. Then the dream switches completely. Again I am an observer. I\\u2019m watching women I know - they are performers. It\\u2019s kind of like a circus. There\\u2019s a big tent. They\\u2019re in a dressing room in the back where everyone is talking. There\\u2019s lots of love and connection between all these women. They\\u2019re definitely family, they get along, some are actually blood family. It\\u2019s not a hierarchy because not just one person is in charge, but there is a synergy with one person who directs things. Things get done around her direction, but nobody has more or less power than her. This is fascinating for me to watch as she gives directions about how to do their show. It\\u2019s not actually directions. She\\u2019s asking who wants to do what - \\u201cDo you want to do this part of the show? Are we going to take a break?\\u201d Then there is an announcement that this man is coming in and he\\u2019s going to be a guest spot and do part of the show. I see all of the women perk up. Some are like, \\u201cWell, is he handsome?\\u201d But I see the woman who is the glue and directs things. She gets that look in her eye like, \\u201cHmm, I don\\u2019t know if I trust this.\\u201d So everybody leaves the dressing room and goes out in the circus tent area where there\\u2019s definitely a crowd of people watching. They\\u2019re watching a show in a huge copper bathtub, big enough for multiple people to be in. The man comes in and he\\u2019s going to do his show in the bathtub. It reminds me of synchronized swimming and people who act like mermaids, so you can watch through the glass as they do this show under the water. So this man is doing all of it, but normally the show is done completely naked - all of the women are completely naked while they do it. He\\u2019s doing it with his clothes on and the women are wondering, \\u201cWhat is going on? Why is he doing it that way?\\u201d So the woman who directs and has some good mothering energy goes into the tub to do part of the show and she\\u2019s naked as usual. The man who has all of his clothes on has an assistant and she has all her clothes on, too. The woman that is directing things goes in and does her part. You can tell there is tension and this attempted shaming that she\\u2019s in there naked. It\\u2019s totally beautiful to watch her, but then there\\u2019s this man and this other woman who have their clothes. They look so weird, they can barely move because their clothes are dragging them down, especially in contrast to the woman who\\u2019s naked. Some of the other women come in and start doing the dance in the water and they\\u2019re naked. But then you see some sort of official come in and say, \\u201cYou have to wear clothes now.\\u201d So they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, we have to put our clothes on.\\u201d They do put their clothes on. The person who says, \\u201cyou have to put your clothes on\\u201d is the husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing things. He says it because he says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t dance with that man naked,\\u201d because now in the show, they\\u2019re supposed to dance together. The husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing the show is feeling jealousy or protectiveness and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t dance with him without your clothes on. You all put your clothes on.\\u201d So there\\u2019s this dynamic of men coming in and directing the woman and their dancing, nakedness, wildness and freeness.\"],[\"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I\\u2019m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She\\u2019s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She\\u2019s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I\\u2019m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we\\u2019re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it\\u2019s men. We\\u2019re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila\\u2019s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We\\u2019re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it\\u2019s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I\\u2019m watching and I see Aila\\u2019s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it\\u2019s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I\\u2019m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it\\u2019s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it\\u2019s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It\\u2019s not quite a break wall because it doesn\\u2019t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I\\u2019m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He\\u2019s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They\\u2019re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It\\u2019s okay that they\\u2019re playing. I don\\u2019t have any concerns about who they\\u2019re playing with. I think that because I\\u2019m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They\\u2019re definitely working something out. I\\u2019m not concerned about that part at all. I\\u2019m just concerned that both children don\\u2019t drown. I\\u2019m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They\\u2019re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they\\u2019re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They\\u2019re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they\\u2019re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I\\u2019m watching this happen and by this time I\\u2019ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I\\u2019m concerned and don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. She says, \\u201cThe train was raided by these police officers.\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get to it. We weren\\u2019t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.\\u201d I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She\\u2019s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she\\u2019s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it\\u2019s the thing that she\\u2019s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a guy I know. In the dream, we\\u2019re together, maybe we\\u2019re dating. I have this feeling I\\u2019m trying to prove myself to him and that feels really gross. We\\u2019re together and he\\u2019s wanting to go from one island to the next. So we\\u2019re on the Big Island and trying to get to Maui. At least that\\u2019s the impression I have. But the setting doesn\\u2019t look like the islands I know. We are driving in a car and there's a baby in a car seat - I think it\\u2019s mine and his, but I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m trying to tell him how in the past, I had island hopped. I would take my car and drive it down this really long stretch of road and catch enough air to hop the channel - a very wide expanse of ocean between the islands. Somehow I\\u2019m trying to convince him I can do this. He\\u2019s very harsh. I\\u2019m trying to live up to expectations. It\\u2019s very strange because that is definitely not how I roll in real life. I\\u2019m driving the car to the place where I know we can catch enough air to ocean hop. We get to the end of the road - to this spot where I know I\\u2019ve done it before. There\\u2019s a huge wall rising up out of the ocean. It\\u2019s painted in colors of blue to look like the ocean. There\\u2019s actually ocean that comes over the top of it - water has been pumped over the top to make waterfalls. I\\u2019m shocked because it was definitely not there before. The times I had tried it, the road went off the edge of a cliff so you could catch some air. Now the road goes down and hits a shore. There's no way to catch enough air to get off of that and over this huge wall that\\u2019s now in front of us. I can feel that he is questioning me and what I\\u2019m telling him. He\\u2019s suspicious. I take the car and I get down to the bottom and see this is not happening. So I turn the car around. We head off to the right to an old dive bar. I say, \\u201cMaybe there\\u2019s somebody over there who can help us who\\u2019s done it before.\\u201d So we park and we go in. It\\u2019s totally dimly lit and smoky. The food is greasy and gross. We sit there and the woman who comes up to take our order reminds me of a friend of mine. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yea, I\\u2019ve figured out how to get over that wall. It takes certain skills and some special tools.\\u201d She\\u2019s also mad about something. She\\u2019s got revenge on the brain. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you how.\\u201d There are other people in this dive bar/diner breakfast place. They all look seedy and suspicious - rough around the edges. As this woman is talking to us, she\\u2019s super bitter and resentful. I can't tell if it\\u2019s because of where she works or the people she works with or what, but she\\u2019s definitely holding a grudge. She has her apron on and she\\u2019s holding her little notepad in her hand. We are trying to order some food and the baby is with us and sitting in its car seat - so strange because I can\\u2019t tell if this baby is mine or ours or what, but we\\u2019re taking care of it. She offers to go with us to get the car over the wall so we can go from one island to the next. It\\u2019s really important for us to go to Maui because I get the sense that it is a place where we will be free. So, she offers to go with us. Her and the ugy I\\u2019m with start hatching a plan and it\\u2019s kind of violent. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019ve gotta blow up this part of the wall.\\u201d So one of us has to swim under the waterfall part and plant these little grenades down low in the sand. I\\u2019m down iwth all of this, but another part of me is like, \\u201cthis is fucking insane. All of it is insane. What is going on?\\u201d We all get into the car. At this point other people have joined in on the plan. They are her people. So she is following us with these other people in a car, or maybe we\\u2019re following them. We\\u2019re heading back to that part where the road stops down near the ocean, but you can see the wall. She gets in the water with a knife and what I assume are grenades or something. A bunch of other guys she's with - her crew - get in the water. I see the guy I\\u2019m with get in the water. I\\u2019ve got the kid in the car. Then I\\u2019m also going in the water. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s watching the kid at this point. We all swim out to this wall. You can tell this wall was built by humans and it\\u2019s a tactic to keep us fenced or hedged in. Now all of us are totally intent on blowing up this wall. There\\u2019s still an edge of violence, anger and rage coming off the guy I was with. But now you can tell it\\u2019s a suicide mission for the woman and she\\u2019s giving up her life for this. Her crew - all the dudes she\\u2019s with - same. This has turned into some sort of \\u201cfor the greater good\\u201d cause. I\\u2019m treading water and don\\u2019t know how this is going to work. At this point I\\u2019m mostly watching because I don\\u2019t have an active role in bringing this down. I\\u2019m not quite sure what my partner is either, but he\\u2019s got an important part to play. All I can see is that the woman has died under the water. Before she dives under she says, \\u201cI hope this serves,\\u201d or something like that. I watch her dive under the water and she puts the grenades down at the bottom. The wall explodes and she explodes - actually, she disintegrates in front of me. Somehow I\\u2019m fine even though I\\u2019m in the water - I\\u2019ve backed up enough that this isn\\u2019t going to affect me. I watch a portion of the wall come down. Then me and the guy I\\u2019m with swim back to the car and we back way up the road in the car. He\\u2019s still like, \\u201cthis better work\\u201d and he\\u2019s going to blame it on me if it doesn\\u2019t. At this point, \\u201cI\\u2019m like, dude, you guys did all that crap. If it doesn\\u2019t work then I don\\u2019t know what to tell you.\\u201d But the urge to be free is really strong for both of us, so we\\u2019re both willing to try anyway, even though he seems completely ready to scapegoat me for whatever doesn\\u2019t happen. I\\u2019m a little pissed off about all that. So we back the car up all the way up and get as much speed as possible and somehow manage to launch over the broken part of the wall and make it to Maui. At this point, the dream completely shifts. Now I\\u2019m on the top of a hill. There\\u2019s a sports store where I\\u2019m working. Down below is another type of store - it looks like a UPS shipping center warehouse or something like that. To the left of that is a gym. I think I\\u2019m working in the sports warehouse store. I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie, but in some of the pictures, I\\u2019m naked from the waist down and in some of the pictures I\\u2019m completely naked and in some of the pictures I have all my clothes on. I have no idea what I\\u2019m doing or what that\\u2019s for, but apparently I\\u2019m trying to get a good selfie to post on instagram. As I\\u2019m going back to work after this, I run into a friend - I think it\\u2019s an old classmate. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know you worked here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019ve worked here for a while. It\\u2019s a cool place to work.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cDid you know that our friend Levi works down at the shipping center?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I didn\\u2019t know he was down there. Sweet. One more person for me to sleep with!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, Kahenu works at this store with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I forgot that Kahenu was here. Awesome. One more person to sleep with!\\u201d This guy is pointing out to me all these people I know and I could sleep with. I\\u2019m totally stoked about it. Somehow, Jennifer Lopez shows up. She\\u2019s a fitness instructor for all the female employees. I\\u2019m watching her doing a workout and they\\u2019re all doing it with her. They\\u2019re all badass, totally kicking ass, covered in sweat from head to toe. They do have all their clothes on, but it\\u2019s bootie shorts and sports bras. For part of this workout, J Lo is in roller skates and some of it is coordinated because some of it is part of a music video. I watch them all working out, dripping sweat. Then she gets her roller skates and starts skating down the hill because this sports warehouse is at the top of the hill. All of these women, at least 25 if not more, are following her down the hill as part of this music video. I\\u2019m observing all of this and not making contact with all the people. I see Levi coming in and out of the building, but I don\\u2019t actually talk to him. I see Kahenu and start walking behind him. He turns around me and sees me and his eyes glaze over then get wide and he actually sees me, then he gets suspicious looking again. He turns around and keeps walking. I\\u2019m behind him and like, \\u201cHey you know me! Don\\u2019t pretend you don't know me.\\u201d Then the scene shifts one more time. I\\u2019m in a home, but now I\\u2019m in the observer role. I\\u2019m watching this woman who is pregnant with her third kid interact with the husband. The husband could give two fucking shit about her or the kids. She is trying so hard to engage him. She is being a super good mom. Her two little boys are probably 4 and 6 or maybe 5 and 3. They\\u2019re a little bit of a handful. She\\u2019s maybe 8 or 9 months pregnant and definitely putting on a persona of the cheerful, happy, bubbly wife. She\\u2019s also really, really short, maybe 4\\u20198 or 9 - not that much taller than her kiddos. Her husband is going off to work and she\\u2019s saying, \\u201cHey, have a nice day, honey!\\u201d His face is glued to his phone. I can tell that he\\u2019s on the phone texting a mistress or scrolling through pictures of other women. I have judgment around it. I\\u2019m also watching her trying to keep him engaged, and he\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYup, yup, going to work, bye, see you later.\\u201d I see him leaving and her trying to engage her two sons in play and learning like a home or unschooling situation.\"],[\"The felt sense of this dream is sticking with me - a panic from the coronavirus. I\\u2019m in my home, but it doesn\\u2019t look like the one I grew up in. It\\u2019s warm out, like Spring. The ocean is around in the background - I can hear it. My parents are there along with a dad and two sons who I grew up with. This dad was my dad\\u2019s business partner when my dad opened a restaurant. He was a chef and a referee for soccer. I\\u2019ve organized a talk because they\\u2019re trying to take away our rights. It\\u2019s a big community. What\\u2019s most striking is this place we\\u2019re having the talk is this open lawn - a communal area with grass, trees and shrubs - pink camellia blossoms - and white picket fences everywhere and white folding chairs where we are all sitting. I can feel how everyone needs to sit down and listen to this. I have an agenda and really wanting people to listen to this talk that\\u2019s happening, which I feel like I was a part of putting it together. My mom and dad are there and I have this feeling that I have the talk for them to listen to because I want them to grasp a point. I\\u2019m upset about something. The talk starts. Coronavirus is happening in the dream. We\\u2019re afraid we\\u2019re all going to be sick, but we\\u2019re wearing our masks, but sitting way too close to each other. People are complaining about not having their freedoms and liberties. The talk is going according to an agenda and people are wanting to say, \\u201cenough with this social distancing, isolating and taking away our rights.\\u201d But then Bob and his two sons come along with a bunch of other men and boys. They\\u2019ve all had the coronavirus and their mothers and wives have died. They\\u2019re up in front of us and trying to tell us what it\\u2019s like to have this and how devastating it is. Bob is saying that even though he and Sarah were divorced, Sarah came back from a trip to the UK with her partner and didn\\u2019t know she was sick. She was cleaning silverware at her job at the hotel before she came down with it and she and her partner died. Of course everyone who was at the bank where he had been and using the silverware got sick and some died and some didn\\u2019t. Both the boys got sick. They look pretty pale and wan. I hear one say it was the first thing he ever had to recover from. He\\u2019s not looking like his full healthy self, neither is the other son, and neither is Bob. They give their talk to all these people. There are a bunch of mothers in the crowd - moms with their babies and young children. My brothers show up at one point. They\\u2019re sitting next to me. I have my kids with me. There is so much community in this dream - people I know - and it\\u2019s shocking to hear Bob and his sons talk about it and see their sorrow at their loss. The dream goes from this outdoor area to a home. Part of the reason I was calling the meeting is I was protesting that my home was being taken away. Now my ex- father-in-law is in the dream and he\\u2019s trying to kick me and the kids out of the house. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have anywhere to go and the coronavirus is out there.\\u201d Then Bob and his sons who\\u2019ve all had it (we\\u2019re not sure if they\\u2019re contagious or not) need a place to stay. My parents offer them our place to stay. My brothers and I are trying to set up a place for them in the attic. The confusing part is all of the different people that come in - sometimes it\\u2019s my parents, sometimes my siblings, sometimes my ex, sometimes my kids, sometimes my friends including one of my friend\\u2019s from high school, Nani who I haven\\u2019t spoken to since we were Juniors - she\\u2019s one of the friends sitting near me. All of these people I know are coming and going, and sometimes I\\u2019m talking to my dad and sometimes I\\u2019m talking to my ex-father-in-law. Emotions are swirling a lot and I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m mad at everyone or happy to see them or scared for them. I know the feeling of upset I have for Bob and his two boys is big. I\\u2019m so worried about their experience and I know the fear is real. But I can\\u2019t tell how I feel about all the other people that keep showing up. They keep coming and going and playing these roles. The last part I remember is being in this attic of a home and listening to Bob and his sons talking about what it\\u2019s like to have the virus. I\\u2019m making a place for them to sleep - laying out bedrolls and sleeping bags. But I\\u2019m aware that I\\u2019m not wearing a mask and should probably be wearing a mask. The whole time I should have been wearing a mask especially when we had gathered for the community meeting. I\\u2019m very concerned about it. Bob speaks eloquently about what it\\u2019s like to lose your loved one because you didn\\u2019t believe that the coronavirus was real. That\\u2019s what I woke up with.\"],[\"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He\\u2019s very protective. I\\u2019m lying down on my back. I can\\u2019t tell where I am. There\\u2019s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I\\u2019m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I\\u2019m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I\\u2019m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it\\u2019s the time of coronavirus, people can\\u2019t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They\\u2019re gathered around me and I\\u2019m definitely still vulnerable because I\\u2019m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I\\u2019m telling them: \\u201cMy playlists are for pole classes. It\\u2019s not your normal CrossFit playlist.\\u201d They don\\u2019t care. They\\u2019re adamant that they get a workout. So, it\\u2019s either the man I\\u2019m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It\\u2019s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren\\u2019t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, \\u201cOkay, the winners get some of these ferrets.\\u201d During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s my kids or somebody else\\u2019s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I\\u2019m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they\\u2019re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn\\u2019t going to be what they thought. I\\u2019m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There\\u2019s this process I\\u2019m going through where I\\u2019m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they\\u2019re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can\\u2019t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they\\u2019re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I\\u2019m in the observer role. There\\u2019s a man and his son - I don\\u2019t know who they are. He\\u2019s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he\\u2019s very attentive. They\\u2019re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I\\u2019m not very neutral. I\\u2019m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it\\u2019s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he\\u2019s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, \\u201cWe need to take your son.\\u201d The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I\\u2019m fucking pissed. There\\u2019s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it\\u2019s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he\\u2019s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they\\u2019re basically not listening - they\\u2019re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man\\u2019s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that\\u2019s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with some friends - one or two are high school friends, but some are co-workers. I\\u2019m at a grocery store and we\\u2019re stocking shelves and cleaning up. We\\u2019re in the breakroom, too. We have to clean up the store to prepare it for the next day. There\\u2019s an interesting split between how much the men and women are cleaning up. The work is getting done, but the small details keep getting missed by the men and the women clean up after them. The dream shifts a little bit out of the grocery store to another room, maybe a home because there\\u2019s a home office and what looks like a home entertainment room. I\\u2019m watching a man who is a BDSM trainer and you can book sessions with him. There\\u2019s also a gorgeous super curvy black woman and it\\u2019s her birthday. Her husband has booked a session with this pornstar BDSM trainer. His name is King Noire. She\\u2019s so freaking excited and it\\u2019s so cute to see her exclaim, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m going to get hit with a paddle!\\u201d She\\u2019s really excited that this is her birthday gift and her husband is excited for her, too. Now we\\u2019re in what looks like an underground garage. She\\u2019s in some short shorts with a skirt over top and a regular top on. She\\u2019s walking down a ramp. There are other people getting ready for the scene. She\\u2019s so excited. She drops her purse and when she goes to pick up her skirt, it rides up. She\\u2019s wearing shorts, so you can\\u2019t see anything, but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my!\\u201d Her husband is standing behind her. You can tell she is nervous and excited at the same time, but doesn\\u2019t know which way to go with it. So she heads down the ramp and disappears into the darkness of this underground garage. I think this is perfect and she\\u2019s getting what she needs. I\\u2019m observing that part. Then I become part of the dream. Now it\\u2019s me and it\\u2019s my birthday. The whole tone of the dream changes. I\\u2019m with the person - but they\\u2019re not actually King, the BDSM expert. I can\\u2019t tell the person\\u2019s face, but they\\u2019re a tall, muscular and strong male. There are other men around. Whoever I am with, he and I are flirting and he\\u2019s telling me he\\u2019s going to treat me good on my birthday. We\\u2019re in the entertainment center part of the house. There\\u2019s a huge movie projector and a movie playing and there are some really comfy big seats. He\\u2019s sitting in one of them and I\\u2019m sitting on his lap. Now the dream starts to feel weird because I\\u2019m watching these other men in this room with women - they\\u2019re chasing the women. It reminds me of scenes where you see a satyr chasing nymphs. But there\\u2019s an edge of danger that it may not be consensual. I see someone in front of me cracking a whip. I turn to the person whose lap I\\u2019m sitting on and ask, \\u201cDid you bring one of those for my birthday?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh yeah, don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay!\\u201d He\\u2019s tending me to give me what I want and he has his own desires but is holding them in check - I can feel it. There\\u2019s another scene where things start to shift. Now instead of being in this entertainment movie room, all of a sudden we\\u2019re in a different room. I feel like a sacrificial offering. Now King is there in the room. He\\u2019s sitting in front of a computer at a desk and I can\\u2019t tell if he\\u2019s editing film. I can see out a bunch of windows to skyscrapers - a city. I come up to him, put my arms around him and tell him, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m going to be okay.\\u201d He clenches his jaw and starts to pretend to headbutt people three times. He\\u2019s really tense and he\\u2019s gripping the computer mouse. His whole body is really tense. I ask, \\u201cAre you worried about me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, and I know you\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d I say again, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time for me to head down to this underground parking lot. King is walking me down the ramp. I go from light into the dark. He has to stop at a certain point, and now it\\u2019s just me going forward from this point on. Now the dream gets a little funny. It\\u2019s still me. There\\u2019s a group of men - all white men and their faces are covered and they\\u2019re wearing all black. They kind of look like the Ku Klux Klan, but they have black instead of white. There is leather and chains and spikes and a lot of weapons - knives, rope and chains. This is the part where I pop out. Now I\\u2019m watching myself. They\\u2019ve formed a semicircle and I\\u2019m walking down into the middle. They grab this material with straps and loops for their hands. They come around me in a circle and take this material. They open it up - it was folded like an accordian. When they open it up, it circles around me. I am enclosed in this darkness - this black fabric material that looks like a set of bat wings, but their hands are through the loops and they are closing it. That\\u2019s the last bit of the dream I see - myself being enclosed in this thing. I can feel King or my Lover behind me is tense and not okay with it. But this is something I\\u2019m supposed to be doing - being a sacrifice. There will be pain, but it is consensual. But there is an edge of darkness as it is not a consensus between two people, but there are larger forces at play. King keeps acting like it\\u2019s out of his control.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know from waking life, but in the dream I recognize them as co-workers. We\\u2019re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they\\u2019re working. I work there, too, but I\\u2019m there on my day off. We\\u2019re talking. I\\u2019m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I\\u2019m barefoot and I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There\\u2019s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don\\u2019t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I\\u2019m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There\\u2019s some other way that I\\u2019m helping these co-workers. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an energetic helping or if I\\u2019m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They\\u2019re both younger women. I\\u2019m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn\\u2019t super clear. I just know I\\u2019m in the store with them and we\\u2019re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I\\u2019m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I\\u2019ve been hanging out with say, \\u201cOh, we have something for you.\\u201d All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we\\u2019re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There\\u2019s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don\\u2019t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, \\u201cWe have these shoes for you.\\u201d These boots are pretty incredible. They\\u2019re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I \\u2018m looking at these boots, the heel doesn\\u2019t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It\\u2019s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I\\u2019m so, so tall. I love them and they\\u2019re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I\\u2019m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re that tall in those shoes. That\\u2019s how tall you are. That\\u2019s who you are.\\u201d But I\\u2019m surprised. I didn\\u2019t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I\\u2019ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There\\u2019s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It\\u2019s an interesting mix because we\\u2019re in quarantine and we can\\u2019t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I\\u2019m thinking that for someone who\\u2019s never driven a huge tour bus before, he\\u2019s doing a pretty good job. I don\\u2019t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I\\u2019m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it\\u2019s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I\\u2019m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I\\u2019m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it\\u2019s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren\\u2019t going to tip him. I say, \\u201cYou have to tip him. That\\u2019s how this works.\\u201d I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it\\u2019s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I\\u2019m not stoked to be there. I\\u2019m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there\\u2019s stuff everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I\\u2019m somewhere I don\\u2019t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There\\u2019s definitely friction here. I\\u2019m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.\"],[\"I am in a large warehouse with racks and racks and racks of clothing, kind of like a Goodwill, but just clothing. I think some of the clothing is slightly used, some might be new. I\\u2019m with a couple other people - I\\u2019m not sure who they are, but there\\u2019s a friendship vibe. They\\u2019re searching for clothes to wear. One of them is a woman. She finds a green dress with multiple layers to it - a sheath dress part, then a lace overlay. The lace is really frilly with lots of ruffles and volume and not tailored - it\\u2019s more of an A-line. She puts it on. It looks fine on her. It looks alright. But I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, you always wear that kind of stuff. It\\u2019s not particularly form fitting. I don\\u2019t think it shows off your beauty fully. I don\\u2019t think it actually expresses who you are.\\u201d But she likes it, so she\\u2019s wearing it. Then there\\u2019s this group of other people. We\\u2019re standing at a rack where we\\u2019ve pulled the dress from and they\\u2019re watching us. It\\u2019s like the most purposefully diverse group of people - someone in a wheelchair, all ethnicities, skin colors, gender identifications and sexual orientations. I don\\u2019t know how I know this. I just know this. So it\\u2019s my turn and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll try this dress on.\\u201d The group is like, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t. That\\u2019s an ugly dress. It\\u2019s kind of like the same shit you always wear or think you want to wear. Don\\u2019t try it on.\\u201d But I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, I want to try it on!\\u201d I\\u2019m wearing a pair of jeans. I put the sheath part over my jeans. Already I think this doesn\\u2019t look good - Why would you wear a sexy form fitting sheath dress over jeans? But I\\u2019m just trying this on. The crowd is shaking their heads no at me. But I\\u2019m going to do this. They\\u2019re pretty adamant, like \\u201cCould you just listen to us already? We already know. Just don\\u2019t do it.\\u201d So then I pull on the second part of the dress. Of course it looks terrible. It\\u2019s a little bit frumpy with the ruffles and lace and sheer mesh. It doesn\\u2019t look good on me, it\\u2019s definitely not my style. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOkay, so that looks bad.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, okay, but I had to try it on.\\u201d So I take it off and I put my regular clothes back on. Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, there's a gigantic warehouse with racks and racks and racks of clothing I\\u2019m sure I can find something I like.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, please. I\\u2019m glad you tried stuff on, but now go explore more.\\u201d That part of the dream ends. Then I transition. Now I\\u2019m both the person in the dream and I\\u2019m also observing. I\\u2019m a younger woman who doesn\\u2019t really look like me, even the body shape is slightly different. I\\u2019m out in the desert - it reminds me of the Arabian Nights and a scene from the Disney Movie, Aladdin, because there\\u2019s a castle that looks like the Aladdin Castle with the big round spires, and then there\\u2019s desert everywhere. I\\u2019m with a young man. He has a turban on his head and a loincloth. I think he\\u2019s a young man, but he\\u2019s actually kind of ageless. He\\u2019s very clearly a medicine man. He knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s working magic. I\\u2019m with him. We\\u2019re on a quest to find liquid that comes out of this one tree when it\\u2019s blooming at a very specific time. It blooms for a couple of hours and the liquid is produced then and that\\u2019s the only time we can get it. I\\u2019m going with him. I\\u2019m not entirely sure why. I think there\\u2019s a beloved connection between the two of us and also I\\u2019m learning from him and also I\\u2019m his apprentice and helper. So there are multiple layers to this relationship. We head out into the sand - the desert. I know I\\u2019m working on something. I have my own little concoction that I\\u2019m making. We come to an oasis where there is this tree/bush. It looks like a tree, but like grape hyacinths - that purple flower that comes up in the spring and looks like grapes stacked on top of each other. The petals or grape looking things are pink. We\\u2019re at this oasis. The man is doing something at the edge of the water. I\\u2019m a little bit further back. I\\u2019m sitting in the reeds. I look over at this tree and I see it bloom. The liquid comes out and it looks like dewdrops on every single one of these grape-looking petals. There are no leaves, just this trunk and this conical shape. Then all of a sudden there is dew on every single petal. I know this is the substance we need for the elixir - the nectar. There it is! I call out to the medicine man: \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing it! Look! There\\u2019s the bloom. It\\u2019s happened.\\u201d He hears me and goes to gather a bunch of the nectar. I gather some of it, too. It is some of the sweetest stuff. I know I\\u2019m using it for my own potion and he\\u2019s using it for his, but I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m making. I just know it\\u2019s really important for me to make this and it\\u2019s important for him to make his concoction and it\\u2019s important for me to learn and watch the way he gathers and creates his concoction and for me to do my own. This is the part where the dream shifts a little bit. I become the observer. We leave the oasis and head into a jungle. He has a task for me/her. I\\u2019m watching outside of my body and notice I don\\u2019t look like myself - a younger woman with a different body type. She is muscular and thin, which is how I look, but slightly different. I see him tell her she has to climb a couple of trees to gather more ingredients. For whatever reason she\\u2019s doing it totally naked. I see her climb the tree and then she clutches her left or right butt cheek. I can tell she\\u2019s in pain, there\\u2019s a muscle spasm in that glute. It\\u2019s like foreshadowing or foreboding. She clutches it, then pats it and is like okay I\\u2019m okay, then continues on. All the tasks are very physical. One is climbing this tree. I think it\\u2019s a coconut tree. She comes down and then has to climb this other thing. She\\u2019s already checked in with herself - she had that twinge in the glute but she\\u2019s okay. But then I see her climb this one tree and she drops from a height into an athletic stance - like you would if you were an athletic person and practiced at this stuff. But as soon as she drops, I know, \\u201cOh no, that thing that was bothering her is going to flare up.\\u201d Sure enough she lands and I see her wince in pain. I can almost see the pain shoot up her back from that glute that was bothering her. There\\u2019s a younger boy around at this point. When she dropped from the tree, she dropped onto a wooden platform. This younger boy was working the platform. He\\u2019s pulling ropes that are part of a pulley system that is part of this platform she drops on. He watches her land. He is observing all this pain shooting up her back. She is crumpling to the ground with it and I know something went wrong. You can see that this young boy is realizing that he has to go find the master - the medicine man - to come help. I can see that he is thinking that he needs to help her. As the observer, I get the sense that there was a foreshadowing and now here we are at the major cruxe of things. Of course that\\u2019s where the dream ends.\"],[\"There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I\\u2019m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I\\u2019m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It\\u2019s showing up in flashes. There\\u2019s one part where I\\u2019m in an airport. I\\u2019m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It\\u2019s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don\\u2019t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It\\u2019s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I\\u2019m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There\\u2019s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I\\u2019m sorting of chatting with. I\\u2019m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I\\u2019m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that\\u2019s happened. I can\\u2019t find my sweater. We\\u2019ve landed and it\\u2019s time to disembark but I can\\u2019t find my sweater. I\\u2019ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we\\u2019ve landed and I\\u2019m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can\\u2019t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn\\u2019t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn\\u2019t look quite human. So, there\\u2019s this sense that I\\u2019m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don\\u2019t want to be because I don\\u2019t know where I am. I get on a tram. It\\u2019s more like a train that will take us to our destination. I feel out of place. I don\\u2019t know where I am - this place is new, this tram is new, I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going. Even though I\\u2019m part of this group, I don\\u2019t know all the people around me, It\\u2019s just a little uncomfortable and I feel disoriented. Then I come out of that part of the dream into another part where my ex\\u2019s presence is around. He\\u2019s not in the dream with me, but he\\u2019s been around. We\\u2019ve definitely been divorced. I\\u2019m agitated because he\\u2019s pulled more super controlling shit. I\\u2019m just wanting so badly to get away from this person, to get out from under his thumb, to not have to interact with him in any way. In the dream he does have the kids. It\\u2019s just me in the dream, but there\\u2019s a sense of him being around with the kids. I feel like I\\u2019m under surveillance as if he has cameras on me. I don\\u2019t even know where I am. I think it\\u2019s a house, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave the house and go out into town. There\\u2019s a building that is a retail shop. Things are sold out of it, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure what. I need to go there because there\\u2019s a desk that I\\u2019m trying to fix. What\\u2019s interesting is my dad shows up. The front of the retail shop is all these floor to ceiling windows. A lot of them have been broken - someone was throwing bottles or rocks. There\\u2019s glass everywhere in the entry area. I need to go in. I know this shop is owned by my ex and his father. There\\u2019s something about a desk that I need to get or repair. Or I need to get something from that shop. My dad is there and trying to sweep up all the broken glass. My dad is actually part owner of the shop, or maybe he owns the land that the shop is on. I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s super ineffective with his broom, so I just grab a broom and start sweeping. Between the two of us we get the glass picked up. The glass is in tiny, tiny pieces - not quite sand, but pebble size. It didn't break in big chunks - it broke like safety glass into little round pieces without sharp edges. The entryway is paved in cobblestone, so the glass is getting stuck in the grooves. We sweep up all the glass and I don\\u2019t know what we do with it. I go inside the retail shop and walk in through one of the broken windows rather than the door. There\\u2019s the desk that I need. I go to pick it up and move it and it just falls apart. I look underneath and the structure of it is crumbling. It\\u2019s like that really thin pressed board that cheap furniture is made out of and if it gets wet, it swells and disintegrates. It\\u2019s made of that stuff. I\\u2019m underneath the desk and trying to fix it. I ask my dad for help. He hands me a roll of duct tape. I try to duct tape it back together. I\\u2019m working on it and wondering why I\\u2019m trying to fix this desk. It\\u2019s my ex\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t want it, why am I fixing his shit? This desk is not going to provide what I need and is not the thing that I actually need. I come up from under the desk and there are other sturdy pieces of furniture made of real wood. I can see them and I\\u2019m comparing them to this desk. I have this sense of, \\u201cOh god, please make sure that my ex or his dad do not show up at this shop while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I have their permission, but don\\u2019t want to interact with them and their super controlling, contemptuous attitudes of disgust. I know I don\\u2019t want to be there when they arrive, so I\\u2019m trying to hurry.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s very cluttered. One of my brothers is with me. All of a sudden there\\u2019s a bunch of tiny little black bugs swarming. They all hatched at once and they\\u2019re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We\\u2019re both like, eww get them off. I\\u2019m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There\\u2019s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It\\u2019s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It\\u2019s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, \\u201cNo, no. Give me that rat. That\\u2019s our friend. That\\u2019s who\\u2019s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There\\u2019s more space between the rat and the cast. While I\\u2019m looking at this rat, part of me is like, \\u201ceww, it\\u2019s a rat,\\u201d and another part of me is like, \\u201cwell, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.\\u201d It\\u2019s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it\\u2019s a rat and it\\u2019s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I\\u2019m in a home. The part of the home I\\u2019m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It\\u2019s a square room with a round table in the center. It\\u2019s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he\\u2019s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he\\u2019s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frustrating, and I\\u2019m not entirely sure what we\\u2019re talking about. Then my ex shows up, or at least his voice does - I don\\u2019t actually see him. He tells me that he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with the kids. In the conversation with my ex father in law it was apparent that I was going to need to stay in the house that I\\u2019m in and I can\\u2019t move anywhere because it\\u2019s my only place of residence. So when my ex tells me he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with my kids, I\\u2019m pissed because I can\\u2019t get out of this house that I\\u2019m in. I\\u2019m super mad that they\\u2019re all in Hawaii. They\\u2019re not even from there. They\\u2019re just these white people who will just buy land and move there and my kids are going to be there without me to show them what Hawaii really is. I\\u2019m just mad that I\\u2019m stuck in this house. Somehow whatever agreement I\\u2019ve made with my ex father in law is keeping me stuck. Then I\\u2019m pissed at my ex because he just makes decisions about the kids without asking and just does whatever he wants.\"],[\"This dream has a deeper part where I know I was deeper in the dream realms or sleep. There\\u2019s a castle - this huge black maybe glass castle perched on the edge of a shoreline. It\\u2019s super dramatic with tall cliffs and ocean waves hitting the edge of the cliffs. Everything is dark - the ocean and the sky. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s dark because it\\u2019s stormy and cloudy or because it\\u2019s night time. The inhabitants of the castle, myself included, are all pegasuses - horses with wings. They kind of remind me of the cartoon from my childhood, \\u201cMy Little Pony,\\u2019 but it\\u2019s not light and joyful like that cartoon. It\\u2019s definitely darker, not sinister, just dark. There\\u2019s a couple of us flying pegasus horses. We are friends and we all have our own magical powers. We have things to do and are coming and going. It\\u2019s clear that I have a journey to take. I need to go somewhere and fly through the sky. The first part of this journey is me looking for another pegasus sister. She has gone down into the ocean to find something. I realize I need to do the same thing. There\\u2019s a greenish blue orb of light that is way, way deep below the waves and that\\u2019s where I need to go. I\\u2019m flying over the ocean waves looking for this sister and for my way in. Finally I dive into the water. It\\u2019s not cold and I can breathe under the water. It seems pretty normal. I\\u2019m swimming/flying through the water going really deep to find this blueish green light. I do eventually get to it. It takes a long, long time. I know there is something waiting for me and I don\\u2019t remember what it is when I wake up. Whatever the information is, I receive it and I come back up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m not supposed to go back to the castle. I know I am to continue this journey. So now I\\u2019m flying over the ocean. The dark has gone. It\\u2019s like when a storm starts to clear and patches of light come through. I\\u2019m heading to blue sky, sunshine and bright daylight. Clouds are breaking up. I\\u2019m flying out of the darkness and towards the sunny, lighter part. The water beneath me is changing from black, dark, inky and choppy waves and storm tossed waters to deep-dark blue of a darker ocean to greenish blueish turquoise and I think the water is getting shallower. Then I get to a point where there is more land. I\\u2019ve left the land with that castle, which was all dark and craggy with cliffs. The land back there was like black lava rock. As I approach this land and the water gets shallower, I can see shoals and places with coral reef that I can see, then little atolls - places with a little bit of land above the water. Then there is even more land above the water with palm trees. It\\u2019s more substantial and I can see that off in the distance there are homes - a neighborhood, actually. What strikes me is as I\\u2019m flying over this place, I see a wooden bridge. I land on the bridge and as soon as I land, I turn from pegasus to human. Then I notice the water around me is light green and really shallow. You can see algae growing on rocks and the water is really warm. It\\u2019s the brackish water of a hot spring. I can tell because of the smell that the water is from a hot spring coming up into the ocean. So there is a completely different kind of plant and animal life happening here. I get in the water. All of it is so heartbreakingly beautiful - the colors, the shape of the land and reef underneath, the rocks in the water that I\\u2019m walking in, the color of the water, the color of the plants, the flowers, the birds. There are hummingbirds flying in and out, getting the nectar from the flowers. There is so much life. Part of me is still that pegasus, but part of me is human now, because I turn into human as I walk over this bridge. There is a car parked on this wooden bridge. My first thought is, \\u201cHow did that car even get on there? The bridge does not seem wide enough for a car, only a human. And how is this wooden bridge holding up a car?\\u201d Then I see a woman sitting in the car. She\\u2019s taking in the view the way I am. I can tell she has parked her car there because it is healing for her to be in this gorgeous brackish hot spring ocean verdant full of life area. There\\u2019s just enough room for me to walk past the backend of her car and finish crossing this bridge. Her car is in the middle of the bridge. As I walk past the car and onto this second section of the bridge that takes me to land where these houses and this neighborhood are, I feel a shift happen. I leave that very mystical and magical place I had been in with the castle and the journey over the ocean and being a flying horse, and now I\\u2019m in human world. But I\\u2019m very aware that I\\u2019m actually a pegasus. It reminds me of the movie, \\u201cThe Last Unicorn,\\u201d where they turn the unicorn into a human girl and she has to wander the forest until she finds the rest of her unicorn sisters who were turned into white water ocean foam. I feel that way. I\\u2019m not human but I\\u2019m in human land. There\\u2019s another bridge. The bridges change. The first one was a wooden platform bridge and this next bridge is a swinging wooden bridge that dips down and swings when you walk on it. The reason for these bridges is that they are going over the water. There are little islands of land and I haven\\u2019t made it to solid land yet. Even then, there are ravines through the solid land. The land is not yet solid or flat. I can see past that it is flat at a certain point. I have to go over these bridges to get to that solid point. The problem is I come to a third bridge and I can see at the other end a sign that says No Trespassing. It\\u2019s not facing me - it\\u2019s facing the other way. My side of the bridge is open and in fact, everything has been open. But as I get to the end of the other bridge, it\\u2019s sort of like a dead end. There\\u2019s a house. Interestingly enough, there is a bridge parallel to this one that has chains on it that go across. The chains are very clearly there to keep people from crossing or passing. There are signs on that bridge saying you\\u2019re trespassing if you're on here. The bridge I\\u2019m on only has the trespassing sign at the end of it. I go to cross it and it stops at this house. Their backyard is really low, below me. Their house is up a bit on a hill. I can see into their garage area. There are people - two women and a couple of children - and they see me coming. They\\u2019re not poor, but it\\u2019s like the simple houses in Hawaii. They look at me like I\\u2019m not supposed to be there. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI know, but I\\u2019ve come from the other direction. There were no signs where I came from indicating that I couldn\\u2019t come this way.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome down off that bridge and come into our yard.\\u201d Somehow I figure out how to come off the bridge. The thing is I need to continue on because I know there is a house I need to get to that is much further down this path. At the end of this bridge is a road I was supposed to walk on and follow down. This road is on a place called Puako on the Big Island. This neighborhood looks exactly like Puako. In waking life, I lived there for a year with an ex-boyfriend and it was a beautiful place to live. There are palm trees, kiawe trees and sand. The ocean is to my left and land is to my right. I\\u2019m trying to get on this road and my ex-boyfriend is down at the end of the road at a house. There\\u2019s a house with a lot of people and a party going on. I\\u2019m trying to get there, but a part of me doesn\\u2019t actually want to go there. I\\u2019m wondering: \\u201cWhy do you want to go there? There\\u2019s nothing in that for you.\\u201d Because there is this stopping point - this gate - for me at the end of this bridge, I can\\u2019t go any further. The women in this house want me to get off the bridge and come down and be with them. I do. Everything changes in that moment to very mundane world. They tell me there\\u2019s a concert happening. I\\u2019m curious about the concert. It\\u2019s a typical party with smoking and drinking, like the college kind of party. But it\\u2019s the neighborhood with all ages. Somebody is going to come play music. There are three younger men who come near me. They try to engage with me and talk with me. I notice at this point that it\\u2019s cold. I have knit handwarmers and a knit hat on. The pair of handwarmers is a pair I actually own - they\\u2019re elastic and grey and I knit them for myself. There\\u2019s another pair of handwarmers in my pocket that I have as extra in case anyone needs. One of these young men is talking with me about how he\\u2019s cold. I say, \\u201cWell, why don\\u2019t you just put on a pair of handwarmers? I have an extra pair.\\u201d I look down and see that he has a knit pair on, too. In my mind, I think, \\u201cOh, he has a pair of handwarmers that I\\u2019ve wanted to knit. I just haven\\u2019t gotten to it yet.\\u201d He takes one off. So now he\\u2019s wearing one and he has another in his hand and he says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve lost one.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s in your hand!\\u201d This whole time he and his other hand are giving me this weird vibe. I really don\\u2019t want to be around them and I don\\u2019t want to be at this party. I\\u2019m looking for a wide open space where I can transform back into the pegasus and fly away. So I find this place in the yard, but it\\u2019s covered in lentils. It\\u2019s a mountain of lentils. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I can\\u2019t transform in this. I can\\u2019t even walk in this. It\\u2019s just a mess.\\u201d The ground is not solid. I can\\u2019t anchor in so I can transform. In the meantime, these three younger men have followed me. I\\u2019m trying so hard to get away from them. I don\\u2019t want anything to do with them, the party, the vibe of the neighborhood. I\\u2019ve gone too far into this reality. I can tell. I want back into the other one. Even if I could just get back across the bridge, back into that incredibly beautiful land and the bridge that was beautiful in its own way and there weren\\u2019t all these humans yet and it wasn\\u2019t packed in. I just want to get back there or fly back all the way back to the castle. But I can\\u2019t. I am so stuck and I cannot transform. I start to feel panic and anxiety because if that is my grounded space, I don\\u2019t want to be grounded there. I want the other more beautiful space. I wake up with panic, anxiety and grief because I can\\u2019t get back to that beautiful place and I can\\u2019t transform back into my pegasus self and I feel so stuck.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We\\u2019re outside and there\\u2019s a picnic table. I think there\\u2019s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We\\u2019re a part of that. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She\\u2019s hosting. I\\u2019m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They\\u2019re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it\\u2019s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There\\u2019s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I\\u2019m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I\\u2019m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they\\u2019re saying and learn from them. I think I\\u2019m really not welcome here. I don\\u2019t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I\\u2019m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It\\u2019s getting heated. They\\u2019re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I\\u2019m feeling all of these emotions. I\\u2019m pissed that that\\u2019s their reality and mine. I\\u2019m pissed that I feel like there\\u2019s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it\\u2019s more equal and fair for everyone. I\\u2019m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I\\u2019m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They\\u2019re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they\\u2019re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, \\u201cHey, I want you two to know that I\\u2019ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you\\u2019re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don\\u2019t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I\\u2019m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn\\u2019t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can\\u2019t tell if they appreciate what I\\u2019m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I\\u2019m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There\\u2019s a wooded forest behind me. There\\u2019s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I\\u2019m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they\\u2019re young. I\\u2019m a young adult in this place, or I\\u2019m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They\\u2019re playing and they\\u2019re hungry. They want something to eat. There\\u2019s a guy and in my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201coh my god, pedophile.\\u201d I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they\\u2019re playing. The kids say they\\u2019re really hungry and the guy is like, \\u201cWell, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019re all hungry. There\\u2019s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don\\u2019t even know where it\\u2019s plugged into. It\\u2019s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don\\u2019t want to take the meat from this guy because I don\\u2019t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He\\u2019s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he\\u2019s watching them play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t even watch them play.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it\\u2019s safer. I don\\u2019t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I\\u2019m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that\\u2019s right after me. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re talking about. We are in a different place. They\\u2019re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they\\u2019re in is devoid of trees. It\\u2019s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn\\u2019t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I\\u2019m talking to them and I\\u2019m checking in with them. But part of me doesn\\u2019t want to be talking about this with them because they\\u2019re not listening to me. They\\u2019re not hearing me. I\\u2019m not getting a say. I\\u2019m not getting to use my voice about this. They\\u2019re just telling me how things are. I\\u2019m annoyed because that\\u2019s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They\\u2019re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they\\u2019re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, \\u201cDo you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?\\u201d But they\\u2019re not listening and not open to it. I\\u2019m not saying anything. I\\u2019m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.\"],[\"Holy shit, this dream. And dreams within dreams. The deepest dream starts with me and all six of my high school classmates - two or three women and two or three men. They\\u2019re putting on a hula show for an audience. I don\\u2019t know who is in the audience. I haven\\u2019t learned it yet. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? How don\\u2019t I know this? Why didn\\u2019t you teach me? Out of all of us, I\\u2019m the actual hula dancer.\\u201d They are like, \\u201cWell, because you dance hula, you\\u2019ll be able to pick it up. But we\\u2019re going on stage now.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, right.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have the costume. Can you at least dance it for me at least once?\\u201d They find lei for me and costume for me. Interestingly enough, the costume is a bleached white pareo on the bottom. I don\\u2019t know what we have on top - I think nothing, just lei and lei on our head and kupe\\u2019e on our wrist and feet. I keep saying, \\u201cCan you show me the dance? Where in the lineup do I need to be for all of this?\\u201d We\\u2019re heading out onto the stage. The stage has maybe two inches of water on it and water all around it. The audience is on the other side of the water. We\\u2019re going to be dancing in the water. But I still don\\u2019t know the dance all the way, and none of my classmates are forthcoming. I get the sense that they\\u2019re bummed that I showed up and they were going to do the dance without me. They didn\\u2019t want me there. The reason they didn\\u2019t teach it to me is that they didn\\u2019t want me there upstaging them. This is such a strange thing in my mind. I don\\u2019t understand in my mind why as a class we\\u2019re presenting this hula to everyone and they\\u2019re trying to keep me out of it. Then the dream shifts to me being an observer. There is a dream oracle - he's like Edward - and a husband and wife. The wife looks like Julia Roberts. The man looks like a very stereotypical college professor type white man with the sweater and the khakis and loafers and glasses. This couple has come to see this dream oracle. They\\u2019re in a library - the dream oracle\\u2019s personal library with floor to ceiling books and lots of gold. It\\u2019s really ornate with all kinds of filigree style decorations of wall sconces and velvet chairs. It\\u2019s very opulent. The dream oracle is going to help them work through their dreams. The dream oracle explains to them how dreams work. You can see the man is very, very skeptical. But the wife is like, \\u201cOf course, it totally makes sense that dreams work this way - that they are hidden messages with multiple layers and that they come from other realms.\\u201d The husband is like, \\u201cWhatever, this is a bunch of bullshit.\\u201d This is where there is a dream within a dream. I watch them go into a dreamstate. In the dreamstate, the husband and wife are very lovely dovey. They\\u2019re in an open field with clouds. The husband just goes psycho. There\\u2019s another man there. I\\u2019m not sure who or what he is. The husband turns into a psycho as his wife watches. His true nature comes out in this dreamstate. He\\u2019s not just an animal, he\\u2019s cruel. This other man that shows up in the dream, he cuts his head off. The blood sprays all over the wife. The wife starts to freak out. This is where they\\u2019re in the dream together. So even though she\\u2019s freaking out, I can hear her say, \\u201cThis is just a dream, it\\u2019s not real.\\u201d The husband is trying to kiss her, but he\\u2019s very violent about it. He\\u2019s grabbed her hair. He\\u2019s covered in blood and he has a knife in his hand from when he cut the head off the other person in this dream. They come out of the dream together. They\\u2019re back in the dream oracle\\u2019s study. She\\u2019s horrified. I'm horrified. I\\u2019m looking at the husband and can tell that the dream completely revealed who he actually was. Maybe it was just a dream, but maybe it was the realest thing because now they can see who the husband is. He\\u2019s this violent guy, not the stereotypical well-spoken professor that he showed up as. Then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m no longer an observer. I\\u2019m back in my body. There\\u2019s a woman. She\\u2019s older than me. In this part of the dream, I\\u2019m younger, maybe 12 or 13 at least. She has a ton of books. She\\u2019s selling books. I\\u2019m outside with her. The books are on this round wooden table with a single leg in the middle. She goes door to door selling books and she\\u2019s showing me how to sell books to make money. She has dark hair that touches her shoulders. Her face is friendly. I get the sense she is not of this world. I\\u2019m trying to take in everything she says about selling the books, but I have this weird sense that things are not as they seem. I have my bicycle and there\\u2019s a little basket on the front. It doesn\\u2019t have any gears - it\\u2019s an old-fashioned bike with a banana seat. I\\u2019m putting some of the books in the front so we can go door to door and sell these books. I don\\u2019t know exactly what\\u2019s in them. She\\u2019s trying to tell me what\\u2019s in them, but I\\u2019m not remembering. So I\\u2019m younger in this part of the dream, but then the dream goes forward and now I\\u2019m probably 18-12. I\\u2019m college-aged. Now I\\u2019m with Josh, current lover in waking life, and his girlfriend. We\\u2019re all going to college together. He\\u2019s registering for courses. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m here because I\\u2019ve already been to college and don\\u2019t like college. I already have two degrees and don\\u2019t want to be here. What\\u2019s heartbreaking for me is that he\\u2019s with his girlfriend and they\\u2019re registering for classes together and I hear him say, \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s so many people here to meet and sleep with!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, I\\u2019m going to register for all my classes.\\u201d The thought crosses my mind, \\u201cWhy are you even here with him registering for classes? You\\u2019ve already got your degrees? And why are you registering for all of these undergrad courses. If you\\u2019re going to go back to school, get your PhD.\\u201d My response to that is like, I don\\u2019t want to do that. I don\\u2019t need a PhD. I don\\u2019t need to go to classes to get a PhD. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m here. I\\u2019m only here because I followed this guy here. And now he\\u2019s off and encouraging me to go meet a bunch of people. But I\\u2019m like, I don\\u2019t need you to tell me that. I don\\u2019t need your permission. I\\u2019m questioning why we\\u2019re even here together. I decide to write the whole thing off and try to make it my own. The dream shifts one more time. College is still part of it. Now my mom is here. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey honey, I got you some shoes. They were giving shoes away to low income people.\\u201d I guess I qualify as a low income person. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know if I need any shoes.\\u201d But I look. They\\u2019re these oxfords with the heel and front toe a dark maroon and the rest of the shoe is light pink. The colors go well together and the shoes are cute for low income. But I\\u2019m not expecting any shoes. I don\\u2019t need any shoes. I don\\u2019t feel like a low income person and don\\u2019t know why I need these shoes. They\\u2019re cute but I don\\u2019t actually want them. I wake up thinking that I don\\u2019t want any of this. I feel like I\\u2019m not following my path. I recall how the woman selling the books was telling me I need to do my own thing. I had this sense of frustration and my jaw was tight and tired as if I was grinding my teeth in the dream because I was playing catch up or doing something I didn\\u2019t want to do or I\\u2019m doing something that is not at my level. I get the sense that I\\u2019ve learned all this stuff and am repeating all of these patterns, but it\\u2019s time to move on and stop taking what\\u2019s offered to me as if there aren\\u2019t other things being offered to me or other things I could be taken advantage of. The feeling of being irritated stays with me.\"],[\"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people, but don\\u2019t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We\\u2019re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re heading, except that we\\u2019re trying to get out of where we are. It\\u2019s dark. If there is any lightning, it\\u2019s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we\\u2019re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don\\u2019t even know what they all do. We\\u2019re on the move. We\\u2019re all kind of dirty and grungy. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There\\u2019s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I\\u2019ve been practicing pole moves that she\\u2019s given me at home, but something happens and I\\u2019m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I\\u2019m watching. She\\u2019s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can\\u2019t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you\\u2019re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I\\u2019m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They\\u2019re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven\\u2019t touched a pole in weeks and don\\u2019t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it\\u2019s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It\\u2019s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I\\u2019m holding onto the handle to push out. I\\u2019m super disappointed because it\\u2019s so hard for me to do these moves because I\\u2019ve taken so much time off. I don\\u2019t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven\\u2019t been able to do what I\\u2019d like to do. I keep thinking I\\u2019m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I\\u2019ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back. That always bugs me.\"],[\"The dream starts with me in a car driving through rolling hills with big houses in the distance. It reminds me of a gated community. There\\u2019s lots of land. The parcels are huge and the houses are huge and there\\u2019s a lot of space between all of them. The hills are green and rolling. There\\u2019s a community center that we\\u2019re heading to. I get to this community center and home owners are coming and going. There are tables and chairs in one area and tv\\u2019s on the wall. Another area is like a nurse\\u2019s office. People are having their temperatures taken and getting shots. I think maybe they\\u2019re quarantining for coronavirus or giving vaccines. I\\u2019m not sure, but something like that is happening. I\\u2019m here. I get dropped off in this community center or clubhouse that the HOA owns. I\\u2019m watching people come and go - mostly white men. My ex father in law and ex show up. We have some interactions. I think I owe him some money and he wants the money from me. I don\\u2019t think I have everything I owe him, but I give him some. I\\u2019m reminding him we\\u2019re on a payment schedule and he\\u2019ll just have to wait for the rest. This part of the dream feels uncomfortable. I\\u2019m really not excited to see him or my ex. I don\\u2019t know what my ex wants. He\\u2019s just kind of there lurking. I\\u2019m really wanting to get away from both of them. They leave with some sort of promise from me that I\\u2019ll continue making my payments. I\\u2019m going from table to table in the clubhouse. I\\u2019m bored. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m waiting or why I\\u2019m still there. For some reason I have to stay because I\\u2019m in quarantine of some sorts. There\\u2019s a nurse that comes in and gets me. I go into her office. I\\u2019m sitting on one of those benches with the paper on it. She\\u2019s taking my temperature and drawing my blood. She\\u2019s very friendly and I actually feel comfortable with her. While I\\u2019m in there, some of the wives of the owners of these houses come in and they\\u2019re all very chatty Kathy\\u2019s and dripping in jewelry and expensive stuff. I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m wearing shorts and a tank top and slippers. Either the nurse or someone else who runs the clubhouse sees that I don\\u2019t look like the rest of them. She finds these strands, maybe 20 or 30 glass beads of all different colors. It\\u2019s a gorgeous necklace. She puts in on me and says, \\u201cNormally you\\u2019d have to pay for this, but I'm giving this to you. Don\\u2019t tell anybody I did.\\u201d It\\u2019s something she got from the gift shop part of the clubhouse. It\\u2019s this gorgeous necklace. She wraps it around twice and it looks beautiful on me. As soon as she does that, I'm suddenly no longer this misfit in the clubhouse, I\\u2019m queen. The energy changes. The other housewives, instead of just tolerating my presence, actually really begin to leave me alone in recognition of how much power I have. I get up and leave the nurse\\u2019s office and the clubhouse. I think I don\\u2019t need to be here. I go outside and there\\u2019s these huge trees - they look like oaks. There\\u2019s a storm, maybe a hurricane coming. Some of the husbands are trying to fortify the trees by raking the ground and moving the roots - trying to spread them wider so the trees will make it through this high wind. I\\u2019m watching them do this. Every time they try to move a limb or root to put it in the ground, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the trees. You can\\u2019t change how they\\u2019re going to plant themselves or be.\\u201d I keep watching this one husband raking the ground. I see him take a fallen branch and try to plant it in the ground. It\\u2019s got all this green moss over the top of it. I see him plant it then turn around and move away. I watch as the tree just picks it up and moves it to where it wants it to be. These trees keep doing that. They keep moving their limbs to where they want them to be. I keep shaking my head at these men who think they\\u2019re going to be able to direct where the trees grow.\"],[\"I am in a house. I don\\u2019t recognize the house. My mother is there. She\\u2019s kind, which is strange because she\\u2019s not usually. We are washing dishes together at the sink. The sink has a bunch of windows that we\\u2019re looking out of and there are a bunch of indoor plants hanging. The plants are beautiful. One of them is totally cool and looks like green pearls that hang down. There are other leafy ones. That setting is quite beautiful. The energy and vibration coming from the plants is amazing and healing. But I don\\u2019t feel very comfortable talking to my mom - I feel like she wants something from me and I\\u2019m not wanting to give it to her. She wants kindness from me, I think. I do not want to give her any compassion and kindness. I\\u2019m faking it though and going through the motions. There\\u2019s another piece of the dream where I am holding my son as a toddler, he\\u2019s maybe 2 or 3. I\\u2019m just loving on him and he seems pretty content. I put him down to play. We\\u2019re hanging out next to each other and both of us are doing the parallel play that toddlers do. Then all of a sudden, in my mind, I go, \\u201cOh my god, I\\u2019m an adult and yes, he\\u2019s content and happy where he is right there, but actually we need human connection.\\u201d I pick him up and his demeanor changes from very content and quiet toddler play to this absolute snuggly. His little body clings to me and he\\u2019s so much happier when I pick him up, love on him and include him instead of putting him down so he does his thing and I do my thing. It just dawns on me that I need to be holding him and carrying him. The connection between the two of us enlivens and blossoms and blooms. It\\u2019s so much better and deeper the second I pick him up and look at him in his face and eyes and he looks back at me. We\\u2019re connected and touching and present, really present with each other.\"],[\"I am with my lover - it\\u2019s not anyone I recognize from real life. He has tan skin and these piercing blue eyes. He\\u2019s not 100% white, he\\u2019s definitely a person of color. I\\u2019m in his bedroom. I\\u2019m naked. He\\u2019s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I\\u2019m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s mine, but I\\u2019m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It\\u2019s weird and doesn\\u2019t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It\\u2019s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It\\u2019s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I\\u2019m on my back. I can see my lover and he\\u2019s over me. He has a fork. He\\u2019s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?\\u201d This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s what I want, let\\u2019s go for that.\\u201d Then I do this weird thing while I\\u2019m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they\\u2019re scratching my skin with the fork. It\\u2019s like some very strange BDSM play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, this is what I want. Go for it. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But the lucid part of me is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?\\u201d I\\u2019m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I\\u2019m not enjoying at all. I\\u2019m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, \\u201cHere let me show you how to use your power now.\\u201d It\\u2019s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn\\u2019t. They say, \\u201cYeah okay, show us how.\\u201d They are truly wanting to learn. Somehow I have this queen-like presence, even though part of me sees this is not it. Then they are paid and they leave. Other people are showing up at the house, like we\\u2019re having a party. There are younger women - girls, maybe early 20s - who have shown up. I\\u2019m out on the back deck adjacent to the bedroom I was just in. The bedroom was huge with white gauzy curtains and the fancy netting over the bed. All the sheets and linens and carpet were white - everything was white in this room. I go out to the deck and some of these girls from the party show up. I\\u2019m switching out the rugs that were on the deck and right at the door to wipe your feet on. I\\u2019m showing these women how to pick the correct one that goes with the decor for this party.\"],[\"A lot of different parts to this dream. I\\u2019m with a friend, Vanessa, she was another white girl who would hang out with my hula halau. She wouldn't actually dance, but she lived across the street from my kumu\\u2019s house and she would watch the kids. She was a super humble woman and also a lesbian. She\\u2019s making dinner for us - she was very much a caretaker. She\\u2019s making a meal. I\\u2019m excited for it. But I taste it and it doesn\\u2019t taste good - something feels a little bit off about it. Somehow my friends from where I live now, Austin and Aila - they own a cattle ranch - are in the dream, too. There is food that Austin is contributing because they raise cattle for eating. There\\u2019s a table where Vanessa is making the food and white walls everywhere else. When Aila and Austin show up, we are in her house, which is gorgeous. It\\u2019s a two-story house with windows that go from the floor to the second story on one side. Her kitchen is big and beautiful. She\\u2019s upset about something. She leaves. Austin starts to tell us that she\\u2019s trying to kill herself - she\\u2019s been eating poison. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on. Why is she doing that? I keep asking him if I can go see her or find her. He says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t even find her.\\u201d He also says, \\u201cNo, leave her be. She wants to be alone.\\u201d I\\u2019m really worried about this. He says, \\u201cCome with me.\\u201d I go with him. Now there are other people around and I\\u2019m not quite sure who they are - it might be my siblings or other people we both know. He says, \\u201cWe have a job to do, so let\\u2019s give Aila her space. Let\\u2019s go do our job.\\u201d We go to a Home Depot or Lowe\\u2019s type of place with hardware and all the stuff you\\u2019d find at those kinds of places, as well as their garden center. He says, \\u201cEverybody grab a plant.\\u201d We all have to bring a plant with us. I have a plant in my hand and am feeling good about having this plant - a green lush hanging plant. Whoever else I\\u2019m with is young because it feels like Austin is directing us all. He\\u2019s in charge of directing us and giving us a task. So now all of us have plants. We\\u2019re filing through the checkout line with our plants. Then, Austin and the others start to recede. Even the hardware store starts to recede. What comes forward is what seems to be Lahaina in Maui. But it does not actually look like Lahaina, at least not the Lahaina I remember. I\\u2019m there and I\\u2019m on the street. My plant is gone now. I think I\\u2019m with one of my brothers. We are walking through the streets. I have this feeling of homesickness and longing. Even though the streets don\\u2019t look like Lahaina, the palm trees are there, the tall papaya trees the banyan, and the monkeypod trees are there. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood and walking down these streets with houses on them. At one point, there\\u2019s a really big hill that I need to walk up. Through all of this, my brother is with me. Then he disappears. I\\u2019m now wandering through a part of Lahaina that feels barren or industrial - it doesn\\u2019t feel beautiful like Hawaii is. My mom and dad show up and say, \\u201cHere, come with us. We\\u2019re going this direction.\\u201d They\\u2019re young - they don\\u2019t look like who I grew up with, but like who they looked like before kids. So I follow them to the end of the road. They get in this line. There\\u2019s a crowd of people and a house. The house is freaking beautiful. Suddenly, the Ko\\u2019olaus are there. At the end of this road, we\\u2019ve passed through this weird area that doesn\\u2019t look like Hawaii and now we\\u2019re at this house that does look like Hawaii. There\\u2019s an avocado tree growing in the yard. The backdrop is all these green luscious Ko\\u2019olau mountains. There\\u2019s a crowd of people all there to see the wizard that lives at this house at the end of the road where everything is lush and green. He has some answers for everybody. My parents say, \\u201cYou have to be very respectful. You may not be invited in. He may not talk with you.\\u201d Then I see the wizard come out of his house. He wanders up the side of his lawn. There is a thick grey wall between the neighborhoods and the magical place of green and avocado trees and lusciousness. I\\u2019m on the side of the wall that is the neighborhood side. The wizard invites two people in at a time to talk with him. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to go into my house this time. You can ask me questions out here in my yard.\\u201d His yard is the base of the Ko\\u2019olaus so it goes up really steeply. I\\u2019m watching from the side of the wall as all these people go and ask their questions of him. My parents turn. I have an old point and shoot camera, and this other woman grabs the camera out of my hand. I\\u2019m trying to take pictures of the green mountains - not of the wizard and my parents. The beauty is so breathtaking that I want to take a picture of it. But this woman comes up. She is a tourist with an accent, not from the US. She grabs my little grey camera and she goes to advance the film - the way you do by pulling back on the lever. But instead of doing that, she starts winding the film up, the way you do when you finish a roll. I can hear her breaking the camera as she does that. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not how you do it. You\\u2019re not actually being helpful.\\u201d But she thinks she\\u2019s being so helpful. I\\u2019m looking at the camera and thinking if I try to advance it just once it will be okay. I try and it doesn\\u2019t work. I can see where it is and open it up, but I know if I do, I will ruin the film. I do open it up and see that sure enough the film on the inside is broken. So there\\u2019s no camera, no pictures. This woman was in line behind my parents who had been talking with the wizard this whole time. I go around the wall and sneak up and sit down to hear what he has to say. There is a sense that he will teach me and share with me what he knows. My parents didn\\u2019t think it was time for me to learn from him because I\\u2019m a kid to them, but I know I\\u2019m me and I can definitely learn all the things that need to be learned about magic from a wizard. He agrees to start teaching me. I sit down with him in his yard at the base of these mountains. There\\u2019s one other piece of the dream where I\\u2019m the observer. It\\u2019s a young couple - teenage kids. They\\u2019ve run off together. They\\u2019ve run away from their families so they can be together even if it\\u2019s just at the beach, which is where I\\u2019m seeing them. She\\u2019s definitely the one who is more riled up and instigating and pushing it. He has fear of his parents and retaliation, but he really loves her and wants to be with her. So the two of them are just hanging out for now. I see him sitting at a dock and she says, \\u201cHey, we\\u2019ve gotta go do these things. We have to get away from our family, society and culture that say we can't be together.\\u201d The boy is a Latino boy. The girl is white. At one point she drops herself into the ocean off the edge of this dock. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh gross, the water is not clean. There is too much pollution. This sandy beach you were sitting on is covered in micro-litter. It\\u2019s just not clean.\\u201d The boy is saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not clean. Don\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we only live once. We have to do these things. Come into the water. Play with me.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my son and we are going to an event - it\\u2019s a game you play and you can win money if you get the answers right, kind of like Jeopardy or something. We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it. My son is about 10 or 11 in the dream. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go do this! It will be fun.\\u201d He\\u2019s kind of dubious. I\\u2019m also a little dubious. I\\u2019m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we\\u2019re going to do this trivia type thing and it\\u2019s all shit I don\\u2019t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We\\u2019ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I\\u2019ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven\\u2019t answered them at all because I didn\\u2019t know the answer. I\\u2019m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can\\u2019t believe I don\\u2019t know the answers to any of these things. I\\u2019m going like, \\u201cWell, this is shit I don\\u2019t care about, so of course I don\\u2019t know the answers.\\u201d All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I\\u2019m completely clueless. Their judgement and my judgement are super real. My son is looking at me like, \\u201cMom, this is not fun.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, this is not fun at all.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting to leave because I honestly don\\u2019t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.\"],[\"I was with my dad in a restaurant. The restaurant is gloomy looking. There are plush booth-like seats. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m just in that space with him. Then he gets up and leaves. I have his briefcase. I don\\u2019t want to be here. I carry his briefcase and go outside. It is bright daylight. It reminds me of being in a casino where they keep the lights dark so you don\\u2019t know what time it is, so the contrast is weird when I walk outside. I walk down this dirt road. There are fields on either side and barbed wire fences. I think I\\u2019m barefoot and I still have his briefcase. I keep walking. I am going past these houses and notice that some of them are old and falling apart - they are the original houses of the neighborhood. And then there are some new gigantic behemoth houses. The new houses are just huge - all I can see is rooftop after rooftop and I can\\u2019t even see the backend of these houses. Then I get past these houses and there are two separate little farms. The houses are older. It\\u2019s clearly a one-person show. Fruits and vegetables are planted and there are flowers. There\\u2019s also hay for mulching. I\\u2019m walking down the lane, then actually walk through the garden because it\\u2019s so inviting. Then I cross over this boundary - a space of land in between these two farms or houses with gardens - to go to the other little farm. Then I realize the ground underneath me is all hot coals, but my feet are not burning. I\\u2019m wanting to cross and get around, but suddenly I\\u2019m in a labyrinth and I can\\u2019t get out of it. The two owners of the house come out - two older white women. They are trying to help me get out of this little inbetween land that is basically all hot coals. It\\u2019s burning their feet, but not mine. They say, \\u201cWell, you can go that way, but you\\u2019re going to burn yourself.\\u201d But I\\u2019m not getting burned. I don\\u2019t go the way I think I\\u2019m going to go because they say I\\u2019m going to burn myself, but it\\u2019s not hot. At one point I do get out and wave goodbye to these women. As I\\u2019m walking down the lane, these dark hedges appear on either side, maybe to my shoulder height. I still have my dad\\u2019s black briefcase in my hand. Now I think I\\u2019m lost. So I pull an old-fashioned walkie-talkie out of the briefcase and press the button and am like, \\u201cHey dad, can you come pick me up?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cHow are you even contacting me?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI have your briefcase and it has this little walkie-talkie in it. Do you remember? It\\u2019s one of the original cell phones we used to have.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI thought I got rid of that a long time ago. How do you have it? How does it even work?\\u201d I keep saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, but can you come get me?\\u201d He\\u2019s fixating on this thing. He doesn\\u2019t ever come get me. I end up in this house with a friend of mine. I don\\u2019t know her in real life. In the dream, she\\u2019s a kind, effervescent, bubbly, very innocent woman with dark hair. She\\u2019s very round with pale skin. Round cheeks, ample breasts, round butt. She and I are walking together. We\\u2019ve walked across a yard into a house. The guy who is there asks, \\u201cCan I help you?\\u201d because we just show up. She starts to make herself super comfy - gets water and starts to cook. The mother and father who own this house show up and they\\u2019re watching her move around. We\\u2019re all having small talk. It\\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that this woman is the perfect partner for the man in this house - the son of the couple that\\u2019s there. Everything she does, you see his eyes getting bigger and bigger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, she does it like how I do it!\\u201d and \\u201cOh my gosh, I never could figure out how to make bread rise and now she can make the bread rise!\\u201d She\\u2019s not showing off, and she\\u2019s very silly about it. He\\u2019s just suddenly smitten. The parents have this grin on their faces and are laughing and like, \\u201cOh yes! Our son\\u2019s finally going to be married off!\\u201d They come together and you can see this is a little match made in heaven. We go back outside. Then the dream skips a bit and I don\\u2019t have the briefcase or walkie-talkie anymore. We are walking down a lane, but now all the houses are on my left, whereas before they were all on my right. There\\u2019s a big rolling hill - like the hills in Hawaii, covered in green grass. I can see up a ways that there is an outdoor patio with an outdoor fire pit like you\\u2019d see at a ski lodge. It\\u2019s the wedding because a bunch of people have gathered. I don\\u2019t recognize anyone except this couple who used to be my old neighbors in the condo I live in now, Rebecca and Oliver. Rebecca was pregnant while they lived here and now she\\u2019s pregnant again. I see them walking up the hill, but they have 7 or maybe 8 children. She\\u2019s carrying an infant and she\\u2019s very far along with another one. Maybe 9 kids all together. I\\u2019m gobsmacked because that\\u2019s so many kids and they\\u2019re all young - all under 5. Part of me doesn\\u2019t know how that\\u2019s possible. I just look at them and are like, \\u201cAre you guys done having kids?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cNo, we love children.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, if you\\u2019ve got the resources!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at Rebecca and she looks a little haggard, but Oliver is right there with her helping with all the young kids. The dream ends with me wondering why they have so many kids.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I\\u2019m in the back - the receiving room. There\\u2019s tons of product to put out, but it\\u2019s time to close and go home. So we\\u2019re all working as quick as we can. My coworkers along with the manager I usually close with at night are there. My manager is saying, \\u201cOkay, finish this cart, but leave the rest. It\\u2019s time to get out. We need to be done.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what she says, so I gather up my stuff and go out. But then she's like, \\u201cOh no, we\\u2019re not leaving out. We have to put all this away.\\u201d There are a bunch of brand new carts out in this open space in the store. They have orange handles and our carts have green handles, so I\\u2019m looking at these orange handles and one of my other coworkers who is also a manager says, \\u201cHey, can you clean that one cart right there?\\u201d It has all this sticky stuff on it - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s honey or maple syrup or what. I\\u2019m looking at it and am like, \\u201cOh my god, this is going to take forever to clean. I just want to go home.\\u201d But they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t go home until this stuff is put away or cleaned up.\\u201d So, I\\u2019m scrubbing this and I\\u2019m pretty cranky about it. I get it clean. Then I realize later that if I had just stuck the cart in the freezer, that stuff would have frozen and I could have just flaked it off. But I get it cleaned and I roll it to the back. Now everybody is ready to go, but they\\u2019re waiting on me because it took me forever to clean that cart. I sit down because I need to change my shoes and take off my apron. They\\u2019re all in the room where we clock out. I\\u2019m still in the break room, trying to hurry. Suddenly, this pole appears in the receiving room in the back. The coworker who told me to clean all the sticky stuff off the cart is like, \\u201cOh, can you show me some pole stuff? I want to see what it looks like.\\u201d So, I get on there and I do some moves. I\\u2019m totally impressed with myself because I didn\\u2019t know I could do all these moves and they look good. She\\u2019s totally impressed. But I still have this in the back of my mind that I need to hurry up and get my stuff and go. But she\\u2019s like, \\u201cShow me another one.\\u201d So I go to do the same moves but on the other side - my drunk side. I\\u2019m not as good on the drunk side. I don\\u2019t hang onto the pole and I\\u2019m falling off. I feel rushed anyway. So I mess it up. I don't fall off the pole, but I get off real quick. She leaves. I go to gather my stuff again because I still don\\u2019t have everything because I was on the pole. I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes. I get my shoes on. In my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you putting these heels on? You\\u2019re going to have to get in the car and drive. It\\u2019s hard to drive in heels. You should just leave your flats on.\\u201d I get my bag. It\\u2019s one of those sports bags that have shoes and my lunch and my earrings - I haven\\u2019t put my earrings back on. I go to leave and I\\u2019m rushed because everybody is waiting on me. We walk out the back door. I\\u2019m no longer in town. As soon as I go out the back door, I\\u2019m somewhere else. I\\u2019m not entirely sure where I am. There\\u2019s a train like the sugarcane train that\\u2019s in Maui that is open on all sides. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I gotta catch this train.\\u201d I get on the train. I am still messing with my shoes and I don\\u2019t get off at my stop. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, well it\\u2019s okay, I\\u2019ll keep riding the train.\\u201d I think maybe I\\u2019ll walk home. I don\\u2019t know why I decide to stay on the train instead of getting off at my stop. Now the train goes and it\\u2019s long past any of my stops. We\\u2019re passing a ton of ocean - there\\u2019s this large expanse of ocean on my right side. The train is on land still, but all of this ocean passes and suddenly I\\u2019m in Lahaina, on Maui. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m really screwed now. There\\u2019s no way for me to get home.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left my phone at work - at the grocery store. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well maybe i can just get off at this stop and I\\u2019ll walk home.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019m going to walk home. It\\u2019s so far for me to get home. So I go to get off the train at this one stop as I hear the conductor say, \\u201cAnybody for this street?\\u201d The street names are all in Hawaiian. It looks like we\\u2019re on Front Street in Lahaina, at least parts of it look like what I remember Front STreet looking like. So I go to get off and then I realize, \\u201cNope, I can\\u2019t.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left that sports travel duffel bag on the train, too. So, the train goes into town and then it starts to reverse a little bit and backs up for a couple of stops. I get off at the stop closest to home, except it\\u2019s still miles and miles away. I get off and then I realize I can\\u2019t get off and this is silly of me. There\\u2019s no way I can get anywhere and I left my bag on the train. So I get back on and go to get my bag. But now I don\\u2019t know what to do because the train is going to go forward again. I\\u2019m just going to be further away from home than I want to be. But if I get off here, there\\u2019s no one for me to call to get me home and I don\\u2019t have my phone with me. I think, \\u201cWell, my dad lives in Lahaina.\\u201d But even then, I can\\u2019t call him and I don\\u2019t want to be with or near him anyway.\"],[\"This dream starts with Dana and I. We\\u2019re together and learning about anti-racism. We\\u2019re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We\\u2019re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He\\u2019s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we\\u2019re all watching. I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I\\u2019m feeling unsure and I don't know what we\\u2019re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don\\u2019t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I\\u2019m white. So I\\u2019m nervous. We\\u2019re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, \\u201cWhat do I do with Majesty?! I\\u2019m not nursing and I can\\u2019t feed him!\\u201d I have this feeling that I can\\u2019t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I\\u2019m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We\\u2019re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, you just dropped the baby!\\u201d I go to pick up the baby and Majesty\\u2019s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no!\\u201d I\\u2019m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?\\u201d Then I realize Majesty\\u2019s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he\\u2019s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he\\u2019s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphitheatre. I\\u2019m going to watch a performance. Everybody in the crowd is dressed to the nines like they\\u2019re going to see an opera. In the front row I see Nani, Janet and Shawna who are my three friends from high school that I used to hang out with. I see them and am pretending not to see them because I don't want to talk to them. But they see me and I see them track me. I walk past them and sit. I watch the performance (I don\\u2019t remember what it was). The performance ends and I walk out of the theatre. I\\u2019m in the lobby now and the lobby looks an awful lot like the lobby of the theatre at the high school I went to. It was called Gates Theatre because that was the last name of the people who donated enough money to build it. The three of them call my name and are like, \\u201cRose! Hi! We see you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEh, hi!\\u201d But I don\\u2019t want to talk. In Junior year of high school, Nani and Janet dropped me from the friend group and Shawna went with another friend group so I was left with no friends in my junior year. In my senior year, Nani moved away, but she sent me a letter apologizing for ostracizing me and leaving me out. I realize this is my hesitation. They always show up in my dreams and I'm like, Eh. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou know what, I\\u2019m great, I\\u2019m fine.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do small talk. But Nani wants a hug, so I guess I\\u2019ll hug her. Then I get away as quickly as I can. I go sit on a barstool at a tall table. My classmate Ikaika who I've known since second grade cruises by. He does this double take because I don\\u2019t look how I used to look and it\\u2019s not just age - I\\u2019ve had a nose job since my brother broke my nose and I just look different than I did in high school. He\\u2019s trying to figure out who it is. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey Ikaika, it\\u2019s Rose.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d He\\u2019s doing the double take thing and side eye thing that men do when they see an attractive woman. He's like, \\u201cYou are so beautiful. You are gorgeous.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup!\\u201d I hug him hello and we do some small talk and then he goes on his way. Then the dream comes back around to King Noire and anti-racism and sex work. Now I\\u2019m in a car with King. It\\u2019s a Cadillac and the top is down. We\\u2019re driving through a city and through some shady neighborhoods. I\\u2019m taking everything in. My jaw is dropped. He\\u2019s talking to me about sex, anti-racism and social justice. I can\\u2019t recall his exact words. He\\u2019s teaching and I\\u2019m listening. We end up near a river. There\\u2019s a shell floaty - like Aphrodite. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, now here\\u2019s the part of your education aroudn sex.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d Oh, I\\u2019ve been eating blueberries and they\\u2019re so sweet - they\\u2019re the most magical delicious blueberries that have ever existed. I climb on the shell and I have the blueberries. I\\u2019m wearing a skirt. King offers me the rest of the blueberries: \\u201cTake as many as you want because these are the last of them. So I put the blueberries in my lap right over my pussy. I\\u2019m eating them and am reclined back in this shell that is now floating down the river. King is like, \\u201cNow it\\u2019s time for your sex education.\\u201d There are so many feelings and thoughts and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what to do!\\u201d He leans over me and starts to eat the blueberries out of my lap where I have them nestled in my skirt. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh hell yes!\\u201d When I look up, I realize he\\u2019s completely naked and he\\u2019s leaning over me from the top. So it\\u2019s like yes, his penis is right in my face. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! I know what to do with this!\\u201d From that point forward, all of my \\u201coh my god I don't know what\\u2019s happening\\u201d thoughts change to \\u201coh I don\\u2019t need to be an expert, I know what to do with what's in front of me.\\u201d There\\u2019s this beautiful dick hanging in front of my mouth and I am definitely going to suck on that. It\\u2019s a knowing. This part ends with us 69\\u2019ing in a shell floating down a river in a city by some shady neighborhoods. It\\u2019s not a problem! I realize I was just getting in my own way of things I was trying to learn. The whole time King was being very stern and very king-like. There\\u2019s a recognition of King and his wife - they are so centered, they know who they are, they know what they\\u2019re doing here, they know their worth, they don't fucking question it, they just are king and queen. The whole time I didn\\u2019t know if I was worthy. But by the end of the dream, I knew what to do and realized this is very human. What else would you do if I had a lapful of blueberries?!\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to see my lover. He\\u2019s working out in the forest. There\\u2019s a complex of a bunch of buildings where he\\u2019s working with a bunch of his buddies. One building is a dorm. There\\u2019s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I\\u2019m out there and thinking I\\u2019ll do this work with him. He\\u2019s really not happy to see me. He\\u2019s really pissed off that I\\u2019m in his space. I\\u2019m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there\\u2019s a whole sheet of them, so there\\u2019s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I\\u2019ve collected it and I\\u2019m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There\\u2019s a presence of my son, but he\\u2019s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don\\u2019t come out here.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019m actually here to do work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t lie to me. I know you\\u2019re here to see me.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling hurt and confused. I\\u2019m not really sure why I\\u2019m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he\\u2019s not happy about it. I\\u2019m not happy about it now either, because he\\u2019s being a bit of a dick. He\\u2019s asking me all kinds of questions like, \\u201cWhat are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?\\u201d He\\u2019s asking all these questions that I don\\u2019t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn\\u2019t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can\\u2019t remember. In the last scene, I\\u2019m with a client of mine who is getting married. It\\u2019s the day of the wedding and I\\u2019m there as an officiant. I\\u2019m also there to set up the wedding. It\\u2019s the second time she\\u2019s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting read are not there. I\\u2019m trying to make these burlap pumpkins as part of the decor. I\\u2019m just making do with what I\\u2019ve got because I can\\u2019t find some of the supplies I used last time when I was getting everything ready for the wedding, but it didn\\u2019t happen. This time I\\u2019m trying to do my best with what I\\u2019ve got. My client is really excited. She\\u2019s trying on her wedding dress. She\\u2019s showing it to me. We\\u2019re in this room that\\u2019s part of a bigger hall where she\\u2019s getting married. Her bridesmaids are there and there are other people. It\\u2019s going to work even though it got canceled once and we don\\u2019t have all the supplies we had last night. We\\u2019re still making the wedding work and she still looks beautiful. There\\u2019s joy in this part of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with this older man in his 50s or so - he\\u2019s white with blonde curly hair like a surfer dude. His body is in shape, but since he\\u2019s 50 everything is not as firm. He has a wife, but we\\u2019re hanging out together. I don\\u2019t know what exactly we\\u2019re doing. We\\u2019re exploring some kind of weird relationship. The scene stays in mind of us in bed together. I\\u2019ve thrown the covers back to get out of bed and I\\u2019ve started my period. There\\u2019s a little bit of blood on the sheets. I\\u2019m wearing underwear, which is crazy because I don\\u2019t. There\\u2019s blood on the inside of the underwear and it has seeped through. I take the underwear off and go to take a shower. I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and am rinsing the underwear in cold water. I see the words \\u201cBlockbuster\\u201d stamped on the inside of the underwear. I\\u2019m watching the blood disappear. I get up and come back to the bedroom and the man\\u2019s wife is there. We\\u2019ve both known he\\u2019s married and she\\u2019s fine with me being around. She\\u2019s older - their age is matched. I come back and she\\u2019s there. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re caretaking me in a way. It feels strange. In another scene, my daughter is a toddler, 2 or 3 years old. She\\u2019s how she was as a baby - on me all the time. I feel like one part of me knows I need to let her be on me for attachment and all that, but another part of me is like, \\u201coh my gosh child, get off, I need to breathe.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much more to this dream, but it\\u2019s gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my brother, sister and son whois 4 or 5 in this dream. We\\u2019re on a rooftop of a building. The building is a college. I have my son in multiple pairs of pants. He\\u2019s old enough to get dressed himself and he comes out wearing this. Even though he seems to be younger, he\\u2019s also 9 - his age is ambiguous. My brother is young and looks as though he did in high school. My sister also looks younger, like how she did in high school. There\\u2019s a break in college and we\\u2019ve all met up between classes and have gone out onto this rooftop. You can see this black wall of clouds off in the distance. They are turning greenish and as I\\u2019m watching, they form a funnel and there\\u2019s a tornado heading our direction. I\\u2019m yelling at my son to go in the door we came out of onto this rooftop. There\\u2019s also a set of fire escape stairs. My brother is over there. My brother and sister were excited about the parties they were going to go to. They are totally doing the college thing. But I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019m too old for this shit and I don\\u2019t drink - it\\u2019s not my thing - plus I have this little one to take care of. So I see this funnel and am yelling at my brother and sister to look and be careful. I\\u2019m also yelling at my son to run back in the door inside where he\\u2019ll be safe. My son goes inside and is panicked. My brother and sister do not believe me and just stay out there. I watch through this thick glass window. As the storm tornado goes by, this woman appears and she\\u2019s sitting in a chair. The chair is small and wooden with two slots across the back. It\\u2019s like she was the tornado or was in the tornado. She\\u2019s telling my siblings what to do. So instead of the tornado sucking them up and carrying them off, she\\u2019s telling them to go jump off the edge of the roof. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to die either way, but I\\u2019m telling you that instead of sucking you up, you\\u2019re just going to jump off.\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified. I want my siblings! But I also want to protect my son. I know at any point, if she turns around and sees us or especially sees my son, she\\u2019ll kill us, too. So I\\u2019m not being gentle with my son at all. I\\u2019m being really rough and have grabbed him by his shirt. I\\u2019m shoving him down because there\\u2019s a dresser between us and the window. The woman is on the other side. All I can see is the back of her and she\\u2019s sitting in the chair. Her hair is dark and is up in a bun. I can\\u2019t see much else. So I\\u2019m shoving my son down so she can\\u2019t see him. The dresser is between them. He keeps trying to pop up to see her, and I very roughly shove his body back down. I\\u2019m yelling at him to stay down so she can\\u2019t see him. I see my brother and sister disappear. She disappears and the funnel dissipates even though the clouds dissipate. I tell my son to stay and I go out the door to look. Of course there is no sign of my brother and sister anywhere. My son is distraught. He\\u2019s screaming and crying and so mad at me for being rough at him and so upset about his aunt and uncle leaving. He regresses into a younger child, from 9 to 3. I feel horrible because I was so physically rough with him and verbally unkind in trying to keep him hidden. I think I just traumatized him in so many ways.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been in school learning. I just have a vague impression of being in school. Right now I\\u2019m out. I\\u2019m either looking for food and have bought food from what used to be a McDonald\\u2019s, but things still look weird post-quarantine and there\\u2019s only limited availability. The golden arches sign is no longer available to be used. I\\u2019ve bought boxed cereal and some other items, but they\\u2019re stale. I\\u2019m going back to return them. I\\u2019ve gone inside the building. I have these two big grocery bags with the cereal and other stuff. I go back to the counter and tell the woman who\\u2019s working behind the counter in her viser and McDonald\\u2019s uniform that I\\u2019m returning these. The whole time I\\u2019m thinking that you can\\u2019t return cereal to McDonald\\u2019s, they don\\u2019t do returns. But she takes the cereal and whatever else I have in the bag. I\\u2019m really relieved. It was a big pain in the ass and burden to have all this cereal and other stuff that was stale and I couldn\\u2019t eat and spent money. I was relieved to get my money back, but also surprised. The scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a gigantic empty warehouse. A wedding or birthday is happening - something is being celebrated. But again, things are kind of strange because the crowd is sparse. There is a pastor or somebody doing the marrying or celebrating...or maybe someone has graduated? My friend from high school, Teresa, is there. She\\u2019s all by herself. I see her but she doesn\\u2019t see me yet. It\\u2019s been years and years since we\\u2019ve seen each other and I\\u2019m really excited. But for the moment our focus is on what\\u2019s happening in this party thing. The ceremony concludes and there\\u2019s a handful of other people - some men - one of which I think is her husband and the husband\\u2019s side of the family. I\\u2019m watching because it seems odd that she\\u2019s not hanging out with or sitting next to him. She\\u2019s off by herself. So I go to talk to her and say hello because I haven\\u2019t seen her in forever. She\\u2019s happy to see me and I'm happy to see her. We talk a little about the ceremony that just happened. There\\u2019s some sort of triage that has to happen. Someone is sick or ill and needs some help. I watch her as she helps this person. We\\u2019re still catching up. Then she finishes what she's doing and I ask her: \\u201cSo how is your husband? How is your married life?\\u201d She gives me this look. I look at her fingers to see if she has a wedding ring on. She has multiple rings on. I think one of them is a wedding ring. But she gives me this look and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been the most painful thing I\\u2019ve ever experienced.\\u201d I'm not sure if she\\u2019s still married or not. She says, \\u201cHe cheated on me.\\u201d I can see on her face that she still has pain around being cheated on. I still cannot tell if they\\u2019re still together or not by the way she\\u2019s talking. She is relaying to me the absolute pain she has experienced in finding out her husband cheated on her. I\\u2019m looking at her and am like, \\u201cWell, my husband didn\\u2019t cheat on me, but I\\u2019m no longer married and I\\u2019m in a situation where things are kind of hairy and frustrating and it doesn\\u2019t feel good.\\u201d We talk about that a little bit. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been so long and we have so much to catch up on.\\u201d As she\\u2019s telling me this, she\\u2019s talking really quickly because she has to catch a plane and leave now that the ceremony is over. Again, I\\u2019ve been looking at her fingers for a wedding ring and I\\u2019m also looking to see if she\\u2019s pregnant. I keep thinking she is pregnant, but I can\\u2019t quite tell. She tells me a little bit of her story. I realize that whatever plane she was supposed to catch, she\\u2019s probably missed it or we\\u2019re bending time because it\\u2019s taking awhile for her to tell this story. There is a sense of urgency that she has to go, though. I am feeling that I really want to hear her and witness for her. It seems important to do that. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a grocery store and it\\u2019s very dark out. It\\u2019s not night, but there are dark clouds. Everything is dark out and even the grocery store is dark and dreary even though there are fluorescent lights. It\\u2019s pretty packed with people. I have a cart and I\\u2019m shopping for the kids. I\\u2019m doing the week\\u2019s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I\\u2019m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me. I\\u2019m walking through the aisles and my kids and are talking about what they want for dinner. Then my ex shows up and he says, \\u201cWell you can\\u2019t actually have the kids. You\\u2019re not going to get to spend a lot of time with them. You\\u2019re just shopping, then I\\u2019m going to take all of this and leave with the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m fucking pissed that he\\u2019s treating me like that and talking me like that and manipulating the kids in front of me. I can see that they\\u2019re torn because they were just having a great time with me, but when he showed up, their allegiance went straight to him. He\\u2019s saying he\\u2019s just going to take the groceries and all this because he\\u2019s paying for them. I\\u2019m so done with him and seeing the kids frustrated that I say, \\u201cNo, you do it. I\\u2019m out of here. I\\u2019m not going to participate in this.\\u201d The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very \\u201cfuck you\\u2019ish\\u201d way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It\\u2019s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I\\u2019m so mad, but I\\u2019m very clear that I\\u2019m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I\\u2019m not playing his game. I\\u2019m not doing it his way.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark again - that\\u2019s been the persistent theme with all these dreams lately - it\\u2019s either twilight, or nighttime, or just dark. This time I\\u2019m in a flat that I rent with a bunch of other people. We\\u2019re in school again. My high school classmate Connie is one of my roommates in this apartment that I\\u2019m in. There are four other roommates and they\\u2019re all men and they\\u2019re really rowdy. It\\u2019s nighttime and also bedtime, so I\\u2019m trying to sleep. All of the beds are in the living room; it\\u2019s not like we have separate bedrooms to go to. The dudes are all wired, they\\u2019re totally super high energy. But I\\u2019m super tired and wanting to go to sleep. Connie is wanting to go to sleep. She\\u2019s kind of fussing over me, trying to make sure I\\u2019m okay. The guys are bouncing around the living room, fighting and wrestling with each other and getting kind of nasty and obnoxious and drinking. I\\u2019m trying to fall asleep on my bed. Even though it\\u2019s my apartment and my place of rest, I feel like a guest, especially with the way Connie is fussing over me and making sure I have all the things I need. She\\u2019s going out of her way to explain the other roommates\\u2019 behavior. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, Rose, we see you, we see you\\u2019re sleeping, but we can\\u2019t help ourselves, so you\\u2019re just going to have to deal with it.\\u201d There\\u2019s an air of \\u201ctough shit.\\u201d I\\u2019m lying down and next to my bed is a screen that separates my bed from all the other beds. It\\u2019s a light colored pine wooden screen with slats. I get a phone call from James, one of my roommates from this dream. In real life James is a friend of a friend who I just went camping with. I like him a lot - he\\u2019s a very soft spoken person and in his day job he works with conflict resolution and has the biggest heart and is so kind. In the dream, he\\u2019s calling me to check up on me and make sure I\\u2019m okay with all the noise and violence. There\\u2019s an undercurrent of violence and threat of sexual harassment. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNot really. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable or safe to sleep, that\\u2019s for sure.\\u201d The dream shifts out of this flat and goes outside. It\\u2019s still dark outside - this eerie green darkness that comes before a thunderstorm or tornado. I can see James in the distance and he\\u2019s with other people. It\\u2019s his wedding - he\\u2019s engaged in real life and they were supposed to be married this year, but they\\u2019re pushing the wedding off to next year because of coronavirus. It\\u2019s not a bright sunny wedding. I can't hear what\\u2019s going on. I can just see James and the people moving in the distance. I\\u2019m watching and I have this feeling of melancholy and curiosity.\"],[\"It\\u2019s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I\\u2019m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It\\u2019s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it\\u2019s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I\\u2019m going in and out of groups and shops. I\\u2019m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it\\u2019s a shop or someone\\u2019s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave and walk out. I\\u2019m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I\\u2019m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I\\u2019m hovering - I\\u2019m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don\\u2019t see me. They\\u2019re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m standing there, but I\\u2019m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they\\u2019re not seeing me. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a lake or the ocean. There\\u2019s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It\\u2019s all outdoors. As I\\u2019m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I\\u2019m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I\\u2019m telling them, \\u201cYes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great\\u201d because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I\\u2019m not going to get any of them because I\\u2019m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They\\u2019ve gotten their cheese and now they\\u2019re at the wine bar ordering wine. I\\u2019m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, \\u201cWe actually have work to do.\\u201d There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There\\u2019s a hose right there. She says, \\u201cI have all these things I have to clean.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I\\u2019ll help you clean these things.\\u201d So we\\u2019re scrubbing containers and tubs. I\\u2019m doing all the scrubbing and she\\u2019s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She\\u2019s really sad. I\\u2019m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn\\u2019t doing a whole lot. She\\u2019s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I\\u2019m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I\\u2019m just doing the motions. There\\u2019s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a shower stall with Ana. I can\\u2019t remember if our clothes are on or off. We\\u2019re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I\\u2019m looking at her like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re just kind of winging it.\\u201d I wish I could remember more, but there\\u2019s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with my siblings. We\\u2019re all in a big house together and it\\u2019s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We\\u2019re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it\\u2019s just covered in blueberries. We\\u2019re munching on them. We\\u2019re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he\\u2019s not a very smooth driver. So I\\u2019m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he\\u2019s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it\\u2019s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We\\u2019re in a house of some sort but I don\\u2019t recognize it and I don\\u2019t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we\\u2019re all gathered for a wedding. I\\u2019m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he\\u2019s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there\\u2019s no bowl and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cHey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.\\u201d The popcorn starts popping and it\\u2019s endless. I\\u2019m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it\\u2019s going everywhere. It wouldn\\u2019t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I\\u2019m looking down and thinking you can\\u2019t even save this. He\\u2019s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, \\u201cnice way to go, dad,\\u201d and I think my dad is standing there like, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s not a good way to pop popcorn.\\u201d As he\\u2019s sweeping up the popcorn, there\\u2019s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There\\u2019s tons of it and it\\u2019s all over the floor. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what you\\u2019re going to do with all of this. You\\u2019re going to have to throw it away.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make more.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.\\u201d It feels like a waste. There was more to this dream, but I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and my siblings are there as well as my mom and dad. My youngest brother is the one I\\u2019m interacting with. They\\u2019re young, it\\u2019s when they were babies. My ex is there, he\\u2019s somewhere in the mix. My current lover is with me, as well. We\\u2019re trying to clean the bedroom and get my younger brothers ready for school. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I\\u2019m getting frustrated trying to get them ready. My lover and I want to take a shower. We walk into the bathroom and the entire bathroom is covered in shit and grey water and toilet paper. It\\u2019s like a toilet backed up all the way to the ceiling. There are white tiles on the shower wall and the whole bathroom is white, but it\\u2019s covered in this grey old toilet paper and poop. We\\u2019re both standing there barefoot, having walked in and are like, \\u201coh my god, this is so gross,\\u201d but not having another option. We just had to clean it. We\\u2019re both naked and trying to clean it. It\\u2019s just so gross. At one point we fill the whole bathroom with water to wash it all away. Neither of us are happy about it. I have some feelings of embarrassment and I can tell my lover is annoyed, but it\\u2019s just something we have to do. So we clean it. Then we get my little brother off to a race - it\\u2019s like a go-cart race. We get him to the race in time after cleaning the disgusting bathroom. So gross.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on the campus of the school I went to for middle school, which was an old inn that was converted into a school. The buildings are all layered shingles and it was really a beautiful campus. I have in the back of my head a nagging, \\u201cHey, you have a car that you have to pick up. You have an appointment with your car.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t put it in my phone calendar for whatever reason. I\\u2019m there on the campus and taking classes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine, I\\u2019ll just remember or I\\u2019ll just know when it\\u2019s time to go.\\u201d So I\\u2019m in classes and car alarms are going off and they\\u2019re kind of irritating. One of my friends from high school is there. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cGod, can you hear those car alarms? They\\u2019re so annoying.\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering if one of the car alarms is my car that I need to go take in and I just haven\\u2019t. Then, she says, \\u201cI also need to go. Can you drive me?\\u201d I grab my keys. The campus has completely shifted. Now everything is concrete - the walls, the stairs, the floor, everything. We\\u2019re walking out of the classroom and down some stairs and into the parking lot. I can\\u2019t find my car anywhere. So we just get into a car. I think someone else is driving and they start driving us around. This part is blurry; all I can remember is the impression of being driven around in a car. At one point I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI need to get out because I need to get my car.\\u201d I leave my friend and whoever is driving us. My hands are full of things. One of the things I have is a parachute-type thing and it\\u2019s small enough to fit in my hand. It\\u2019s really, really windy out. I\\u2019m still on this mission to go find my car. Now I\\u2019m walking down the side of the road - it\\u2019s the piece of the road that was right before the turn to my neighborhood when I was growing up. So this is all happening in Hawaii. I\\u2019m talking to my dad. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s on the phone or in person. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey dad, I\\u2019m trying to find the car. It needs to be fixed. But watch this. I\\u2019m going to be able to get to it real quick.\\u201d I start running in the direction of the wind and the wind grabs that parachute thing in my hand and I start flying. I am flying down the road with it and he\\u2019s totally impressed that I\\u2019m doing it. The cars that are driving by me are impressed and they\\u2019re totally honking. I\\u2019m flying down the road. I fly way further than I could have walked. I get halfway down the road that takes us from our house down to the beaches. There\\u2019s a pullout on one side of the road. On the other side of the road is a pullout but also a cave. So I cross the road and go into this cave because I\\u2019m thinking my car will be there. There\\u2019s all this half-done prep for a meal and it\\u2019s been left. So I go into this cave and see all these countertops with everything you would need in a kitchen - utensils, a stove, a vitamix, a mixer, all kinds of kitchen tools I don\\u2019t even recognize, a sink full of dishes. It looks like it has been left for weeks and weeks and weeks. No one has cleaned it. They were in the middle of a meal when they left, so there are things rotting and it\\u2019s gross. This whole time I have this feeling that I\\u2019ve gotta find the car and I need to get it fixed. But then when I walk into this kitchen, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh shit, I gotta clean all this up, too. I gotta take all this stuff out to the compost.\\u201d I have this nagging feeling the whole time. Somebody joins me, a younger man. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, I gotta work on all this, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, do you want to help me clean this up?\\u201d He starts cleaning up. Then my dad shows up at this cave. He says, \\u201cWell, if you want to get in my car, I\\u2019ll help you find your car.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, what about cleaning up this cave?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, you can do that later or whatever.\\u201d The dream ends here and I don\\u2019t know if I get in my dad\\u2019s car or what.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger\\u2019s seat. We\\u2019re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I\\u2019m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex\\u2019s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It\\u2019s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she\\u2019s there, but I\\u2019m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There\\u2019s only one white man in the entire house. It\\u2019s so interesting. I\\u2019m noticing all of this. They\\u2019re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There\\u2019s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the \\u201cI feel\\u201d and \\u201cI experience\\u201d and \\u201cWhen this happened, it made me feel like this\\u201d language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It\\u2019s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, \\u201cOh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.\\u201d I start to get this nagging feeling that it\\u2019s time for us to continue on our road trip. I\\u2019ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it\\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. I\\u2019m cleaning up my space. It\\u2019s like an Airbnb, so I\\u2019m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she\\u2019s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I\\u2019m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I\\u2019m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I\\u2019m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it\\u2019s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don\\u2019t, and I change my clothes. I\\u2019m kind of damp. I don\\u2019t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren\\u2019t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.\"],[\"There are a bunch of kids that I\\u2019m in charge of somehow. I\\u2019m a caretaker, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure how - I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m their mother or not. I\\u2019m needing to get them to a safer place. I have a little bit of help. There are hallways where I\\u2019m trying to gather them up from and get them on a bus so they can be in a safer spot. I\\u2019m really clear that I don\\u2019t want that responsibility. I\\u2019m going to make sure they get where they need to go, but after that the choices I make are going to have a lot less to do with being their caretaker 24/7. These are not my kids. These are just random children. I can't tell if it\\u2019s a school or daycare or something. It\\u2019s everybody\\u2019s children, but they are not of my body. So, there are other people around who are also caretaking them and trying to get them to wherever they need to go. There\\u2019s just this feeling of needing to get them to a safe place. We get them somewhere, but I drift out of the scene somehow. I end up trying to find a home for myself. My beloved is with me now. We\\u2019re looking at houses - they are the same houses we were looking for for the kids. We were looking at a dormitory or something for them to live in. i\\u2019m looking for a house for myself. I\\u2019m clear that I only want enough house for me and one other person to come stay with me whenever they want. They find a cute house. I can only see the inside of it. It\\u2019s in a neighborhood kind of like the one I grew up in, but I can't really see the outside of it. There are cute cupboards. There isn\\u2019t a lot of space because it\\u2019s just me. There is a lot of wood paneling on the inside. I\\u2019m trying to decide if I\\u2019m going to be there. Then we go out of the house and all of a sudden there\\u2019s water everywhere - ocean. I\\u2019m collecting shells and I can see down to the bottom of the ocean. It\\u2019s really clear. I\\u2019m trying to collect the shells and I drop one and watch it sink down to the bottom. I\\u2019m trying to gauge the depth of the water based on how small the item looks, but water magnifies it so i can\\u2019t tell the true depth of the water. So I\\u2019m looking at this one shell that I dropped which then turns into a shoe. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not my shoe. I don\\u2019t want the shoe, I want my shell. The shells are prettier.\\u201d My beloved is there and he\\u2019s helping me collect these shells and I have a few. Then the scene morphs. That one shoe takes me to another scene. I\\u2019m carrying bags of trash. It\\u2019s actually not trash - it\\u2019s stuff I\\u2019m getting rid of, all these clothes and things I used to have or need but now I don\\u2019t. It includes pairs of shoes. The trash bags go in the trashcan and the pairs of shoes go on top of the trashcan. I\\u2019m back in a neighborhood again and I\\u2019m taking the trash over to my neighbor\\u2019s house so she can look at it. I take out one bag of trash and only one shoe, one of my snow boots. I go get another bag of stuff and the other boot goes on top of the can. Then I get a third bag and there\\u2019s one more shoe - I don\\u2019t remember what kind of shoe. I see these three shoes and then all of a sudden I\\u2019m done with this and want to dance. I want to dance like the way break dancers dance with all body weight and where you go upside down a lot. But I\\u2019m not very good at it. This area where I was taking the trash bags to changes into an amphitheatre with no walls. There are lights being projected. I\\u2019m moving my body and it\\u2019s really awkward in the beginning. My body hurts, I don\\u2019t have the strength for some of the moves, I can\\u2019t think of some of the moves I want to do, I don\\u2019t have much flow and my body is really jerky. At some point I see myself in a mirror - these mirrors have shown up as part of the walls even though it\\u2019s a completely outdoor space. I have short deep auburn red hair. At one point, scratches appear on my back. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no no, we\\u2019re not going that direction!\\u201d I somehow wipe the scratches off my back as an observer, then I go back into my body and try to dance. I think there\\u2019s part of me that is still in the observer role because I\\u2019m watching myself dance in the mirror. Suddenly the mirrors turn a brilliant turquoise blue. They become the background. There\\u2019s also granite rock mountains in the back. I feel something click in my body and brain and I let go. I\\u2019m suddenly dancing fluidly and my body becomes a lot more muscular. I suddenly have the musculature to be upside down and doing handstands with splits and backflips and a lot of break dance moves where you spin on your shoulders and flip in the air. My legs are really strong. Everything is really really strong. This background of turquoise teal blue is bright like an electric vibrant brightness and the granite rock is reflected in the mirror somehow with me also reflected in the mirror doing dances to some music I can hear.\"],[\"An Asian woman who is shorter than me and is beautiful with long hair down to her waist and a beautiful body and face doesn\\u2019t believe she is beautiful. She keeps saying she\\u2019s not beautiful. I\\u2019m watching her take off her clothes and look at herself in the mirror. As she looks at herself, her legs and hips start to get really big and swollen with fluids like elephantiasis. It\\u2019s just from the waist down. She\\u2019s just telling herself that she looks ugly. There\\u2019s a man in the room with her who keeps telling her, \\u201cNo, no, you look beautiful.\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t believe him. She can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and she can\\u2019t understand him. I\\u2019m watching this interaction and thinking in my head, \\u201cYes, he\\u2019s right. Listen to him!\\u201d But she can\\u2019t hear it.\"],[\"Wild dreams! I\\u2019m hanging with my brother, the one born right after me. We go into a bar because he wants a drink, but I\\u2019m not drinking. We walk into this bar and it\\u2019s a two-story high bar and I can see a balcony where I can see the second story. It\\u2019s wood paneling, so the bar is dark and very masculine. There are deer heads on the wall and the tables are round and wooden. It kind of reminds me of a saloon, like a cliche Western. We walk up to the corner of the bar so my brother can order his drink. I turn around and see three guys who I haven't seen in a long time. One of the guys is a classmate of mine and also grew up on the same street as me. I haven\\u2019t seen him since we graduated. I'm like, \\u201cOh my god! Hi! How are you?!\\u201d He\\u2019s really tall, taller than me and I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d so he\\u2019s 6\\u20194\\u201d or 6\\u20195\\u201d so I\\u2019m definitely looking up at him. There\\u2019s also my friend Johnny who I grew up with in the same neighborhood, though we didn\\u2019t go to school together. I knew him the whole time growing up. There\\u2019s one other person, maybe Ikaika, another classmate who I\\u2019ve known since second grade. They come and stand behind me. They\\u2019re ordering drinks over my shoulder to the bartender. Initially I'm like, \\u201cOh my gosh, hi, it\\u2019s so good to see you all!\\u201d Then they\\u2019re like, \\u201cHey!\\u201d My former high school classmate starts asking me these condescending questions like: \\u201cHow are you and what are you doing in your life? What have you accomplished?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, Whoa! This took a turn that I wasn\\u2019t expecting. They\\u2019re standing over me so I\\u2019m definitely feeling attacked and defensive. I don\\u2019t know if I get up on a chair or suddenly have super powers, so I can hover above them. But I get above them, the bartender and my brother and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAnd what are you all doing with your life? Are you guys looking at your misogynistic beliefs and your sexist behaviors? What are you doing to undo the patriarchy and fight for social justice? How are you looking at your biases and your beliefs?\\u201d I\\u2019m asking specifically about their racial and gender biases and beliefs. I\\u2019m hovering over them as I say that. Then I just leave the bar because I\\u2019m disgusted with how they initially talked to me. I just didn\\u2019t want anything to do with them afterwards. As I was talking to them I could see they didn\\u2019t understand what I was talking about at all. They did not get the concept of biases or patriarchy or any of that. Complete scene change. Now I\\u2019m observing. There are a bunch of people who have been in a white van that you always see in the news. It\\u2019s like these forces are coming after the people in the van. The only three people I know for sure are the driver, Donny who does my taxes, Johnny with his wife Amanda who I've known since second grade and their kids. I\\u2019m also in the van, participating and observing. I have a sense of other people in the van. We\\u2019re trying to get somewhere and Donny is driving super crazy over snow, through woods, across rivers. There\\u2019s very little road driving happening in this first part. We are totally besieged. There are people or things not of this world that are coming after us and trying to kill us, literally trying to wipe us out. So we get to Johnny\\u2019s mansion. We are beat up. Some of us are dead. Not everyone in the van made it. The creatures that were going after us are still going after us. They gave us just long enough of a break to go inside the house and regroup to make a plan. We make our plan. I hear myself saying: \\u201cYou have to keep the windows rolled up. You cannot stop for anything. You have to drive fast until we get to where we\\u2019re going.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know where our destination is. I don\\u2019t know why we\\u2019re running from these things, some of which do look human. I don\\u2019t know what our goal is. As we\\u2019re in the mansion, those creatures start to come in. I keep seeing black tar being spit out of their mouths and if the tar touches us, we die. So, we all run out of the house. We have a new white van because the old one got really beat up and just didn\\u2019t work anymore. So we all pile into this white van. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, everyone roll up the windows. Donny, go as fast as you can. Don\\u2019t stop for anyone or anything. Just keep going.\\u201d This is the part where we drive through multiple scenes or landscapes. At first we\\u2019re driving through a town. When we drive through town, there\\u2019s an Asian man who\\u2019s sitting next to me in the van and he cracks his window a little bit. I start yelling at him because I can see on the right side of the car a pair of twin women with dark hair, but their bodies don\\u2019t move like humans. You can tell they\\u2019re something else. One of them spits on the windshield. Donny wipes the spit off with the windshield wiper fluid. The spit is an orange color. I\\u2019m expecting it to melt through the window at any moment, but it doesn\\u2019t. When Donny uses the windshield wiper fluid and because the guys\\u2019 window is down, some of the fluid comes in through the window and hits his eyes. His eyes start to burn. I look at him and his eyes are the goldish yellow color of the spit. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI told you to keep the window closed. Here\\u2019s another casualty that could have been avoided.\\u201d Donny slows down. These twin women start telling us, \\u201cOkay, if you\\u2019re going to survive this, you have to go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I know!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to tell Donny to go. Now it\\u2019s raining and the pavement is wet. We see the road in front of us is blocked by some of these things or people that are trying to get us. Donny swerves off and he goes over a railroad track. I don\\u2019t know how the van makes it over the railroad track. He swerves around this big piece of metal in our path. Then he swerves around other people and other cars. We\\u2019re going through forests. We seem to be under attack this whole time. There are a couple children in the van with us. We\\u2019re really trying to keep those children safe. This is part of the whole mission, though I have no idea what the point of this mission is. It\\u2019s really wild and there\\u2019s a lot of pressure.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outside in a city which has a mix of futuristic tall buildings and older style brick ones. I\\u2019m walking down a street. To my right is a bridge going over water and also a boardwalk. I don\\u2019t know if the water is lake or ocean, but I just know there\\u2019s water off to my right. There are these big crowds of people because there\\u2019s a marathon or a parade happening. I\\u2019m walking through it one direction. Then I get to a point and have to turn around. Now the water is on my left and I start running like I\\u2019m in the parade or marathon. I think veterans are running and people on the sidelines are cheering them on. I\\u2019m running to this shop in one of the older buildings. The shop is run by my friend. She\\u2019s doing a clearance or inventory reduction sale. I\\u2019m helping her carry racks of clothes out the backdoor of the shop and down two sets of stairs to what would be the basement but it\\u2019s outside. So I go out the backdoor of the shop and these steps are outside. I walk down one flight, hit a landing, walk down a second flight and hit another landing. This second landing is below ground but it\\u2019s open, and there\\u2019s a door that goes into her basement. My head is at street level now, so when I look up I can see everybody\\u2019s feet. There are a bunch of younger women who are dancers, singers and artists. The shop owner is like, \\u201cYeah, come get some of this inventory.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s charging them less or giving them away for free. I\\u2019m just carrying this rack of clothes down and putting it down, and I see all these young women and they\\u2019re all adorable and gorgeous. One of them is Maria. She\\u2019s wearing all black and she has this black hat on sideways. These young women are singing while they\\u2019re going through the clothes. I\\u2019m surprised to see Maria and surprised to hear the singing. I kind of wnat to join in but I don\\u2019t know the words. The scene changes with them all rummaging through and Maria leaving - she saw me and was like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m out.\\u201d So then the scene changes to another outdoor area - a food truck area. I see a bunch of friends from high school around an outdoor table. The table is round. My friend Janet is there - she\\u2019s half Japanese and half German. There are also some younger men who I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m observing that the women are doing that thing they do to get attention from the men and the men are loud and boisterous. Everyone is younger than me. Janet goes up to order food. It\\u2019s a Latino food truck with all these sauces and a version of falafel which I understand is not Mexican food or anything. She\\u2019s grabbing her meal and Maria shows up again. It\\u2019s interesting, when Maria shows up, everyone gets quiet. She starts talking and giving directions and instructions and they listen to her. There\\u2019s also a leader of this group somewhere who\\u2019s teaching or telling everyone what to do. All of a sudden I get a feeling that things are getting covert because whatever this leader is saying is on the downlow, so everyone is hush hush, but there are action steps everyone will take to try and correct some sort of wrong that is happening. I\\u2019m not clear on what it is. I just get a sense that some of this stuff is hush hush and the boisterous boys are part of the act. So my friend Janet goes to get her meal and sits down with some other women. Maria starts yelling at her. This whole time I was trying to engage Maria in conversation or engage the other people in conversation and I\\u2019m not getting a lot of back and forth. So I notice that Maria starts yelling at Janet and she\\u2019s sharp. She feels pretty sinister at this point and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow, I don\\u2019t know who that is actually.\\u201d I leave that table and go to a hallway that\\u2019s like a hallway to some bathrooms. I\\u2019m in the hallway and talking with one of the guys. At some point I see Maria again. She either follows me in or I come out of this hallway and she\\u2019s there. She just keeps trying to avoid me, which is funny because at this point I\\u2019m not seeking her out; I\\u2019m just minding my own business because she\\u2019s made it really clear that she doesn\\u2019t want to talk to me and I\\u2019ve seen that she\\u2019s not the person I thought. That black hat she was wearing earlier, she\\u2019s still wearing but it\\u2019s tilted so that you can only see part of her face - classic villain-esse style. I leave this food truck area because I\\u2019m hungry and I can\\u2019t eat what\\u2019s at the food truck. I go down the street a little bit and there\\u2019s a restaurant with Viking food - that\\u2019s how it\\u2019s advertised. So I go inside and read the menu. They have paleo donuts and I\\u2019m sold. I\\u2019m flipping through the rest of the menu and it\\u2019s Chinese and Thai food and all this international cuisine that is definitely not Viking food. My friend Janet shows up at the restaurant and says, \\u201cOh, I will eat here with you.\\u201d She ends up not being able to eat her meal at the food truck because Maria ate part of it and then threw the rest of it in her face. She sees the paleo donuts and is like, \\u201cYep, I\\u2019m down.\\u201d We go to sit down and order more food. I\\u2019m flipping through the menu and seeing Asian food and stuff. I look up and the inside of the restaurant has really tall ceilings and really tall windows that look out towards the street where there are passersby. There\\u2019s a counter in the back, but it\\u2019s open so you can see the cooks working in the kitchen. I can see two chefs standing at the front counter. There\\u2019s a glass case and I don\\u2019t know if there\\u2019s food or what in it. They\\u2019re standing waiting for our order. I know I ordered the little paleo donut thing. I think Janet tries to order something, but Maria shows up again and drags her out of the restaurant.\"],[\"I walk into a room, like an acupuncturist's treatment room. I can see rice screens in the background. I\\u2019m there to see a healer. It looks like a cross between a Master Healer and an ex buddhis monk who I learned meditation from - he left the monastery because he preferred joy. I\\u2019m on the treatment table and facing him. He\\u2019s wearing a light blue robe or shirt. He starts to move his hands like an air bender. I start to fall asleep like the REM healing sleep and there are images coming to mind. I tell myself to remember these images so i can remember them later. Then I go into the deep healing sleep. He\\u2019s still doing the airbender motion in front of my body. I\\u2019m lying on my right side the whole time, almost in the fetal position. He\\u2019s working at chest level - heart and solar plexus energy centers. I have a sense that I\\u2019m asleep for a while. As I come out, my brain kicks in again and tells me to remember the healing images. As I wake up, the healer says: \\u201cTend to your masculine energy child. Look up Libra moon. That\\u2019s what you need for healing.\\u201d I did a deep healing breath as he finished his hand motions - in both my sleep in my dream and my sleep in real life. I woke up in that position - lying on my right side. I had a sense he was removing an energetic entanglement.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with two guys, one of them is Josh. We\\u2019re at a zoo. We\\u2019re looking at the displays and I\\u2019m sad about animals being in the zoo. But, I don't actually see any animals. The displays are all empty. I walk into one of them and am trying to show Josh and the other guy, maybe he\\u2019s my brother, that your eyesight is limited from the point of view of the animal. I\\u2019ve walked into the display area and am looking out to where the crowds would be standing. I say, \\u201cSee you can only see so much if you\\u2019re in here.\\u201d I try to show them this. Then I turn around and it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s an inside part of these displays that opens up into a huge cylinder shaped room that opens up to the sky. Inside are more cages and laboratories and places for the animals. I want to explore this. The other two come in with me. We\\u2019re curious. We don't know exactly what is happening in this area of the zoo. I still can\\u2019t see any animals. Except, as I get closer, I\\u2019m looking at a lot of metal and cages and fluorescent lights. As I\\u2019m looking, these tiny, maybe three inches tall, koala bears show up. They\\u2019re climbing this little bird stand with the wide dish at the bottom for bird seed. There isn't a cage around it, though. The tiny koalas are hyper and all over the place. This scientist zoologist comes out with a black house cat (his familiar?) and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! I want to hold this tiny koala!\\u201d The scientist says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the tiny koala. They\\u2019re on something. I don\\u2019t know what they might do to you. They might bite you. They might scratch you. So just leave them alone.\\u201d So I just look at them. At first there was one, then there were two, then there were like fifty of them swarming this little stand. They are moving kind of crazily. I back up a little bit. We\\u2019re just poking around this inside place and looking for other animals. I get a sense that there are other things we could be doing than this. The scene changes. I don't know what happens to the other two. I\\u2019m in this outdoor area that reminds me of a college campus. There\\u2019s a football team going by. It\\u2019s Fall, leaves are falling, there are leaves on the ground and it\\u2019s kind of chilly. I\\u2019m wearing shorts and a shirt. A lot of the football players are classmates from school, but there are also a bunch of them that I don\\u2019t recognize. As the football team files past me some of them who are my old classmates say hi. They\\u2019re really excited to see me. I realize this is because I\\u2019m wearing velvet bootie shorts and a tiny little crop top. So, they seem like they\\u2019re happy to see me but I think it\\u2019s just because of what I\\u2019m wearing. Somehow I\\u2019m wearing this because it\\u2019s one of those fall days where it\\u2019s still pretty warm in the middle of the day. Apparently the temperature isn\\u2019t bothering me. I turn around and go to this larger grassy area where there are a bunch of people gathered. They\\u2019re all on their own blankets. I go to the spot with a bunch of friends. I don't recognize all the people on the blanket but I get the sense that I know them because they say, \\u201cHey Rose!\\u201d and I sit down and we\\u2019re talking. At one point, Ana shows up with her son. They are so brown - their skin is so dark and they\\u2019re totally naked! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThose two have been out in the sun all summer! I\\u2019m jealous!\\u201d They\\u2019re the only two who are naked. The rest of us have some kind of clothing on. But the thing that stands out is how tan the two of them are. Then, I leave the blanket and go into a house or something. I\\u2019m heading towards the inside and set up a lawn chair for myself. Then someone wants to talk to me and I get distracted and go elsewhere. I do the interaction but don\\u2019t remember what it is. I think it\\u2019s a football player who was one of my old classmates and wants to talk. He tries to convince me to come watch the game or go to some sort of after party. I finish that interaction and go back to sit in my chair, but someone is in my chair. This happens like three times where I go talk to someone and go back to my chair, but the chair I\\u2019ve set up for myself, someone else is in it. The first two times I get a new chair. The third time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYo, that\\u2019s my chair! Get out. I set that up for me.\\u201d The person who is in it this last time is a cranky older gentleman. He maybe needs the chair more than I do. I\\u2019m pissed off about losing my chair yet again, but thinking maybe he actually needs it. Then again, one more football player comes over and wants to talk to me. It\\u2019s like they all want to spend time with me and go on a date. They want me to come to their football games and just be around them. There\\u2019s a funny earnestness and innocence in the way they\\u2019re showing up to try and get my attention. It\\u2019s not creepy at all. They\\u2019re not trying to be players or extra smooth. They just really want me around. They want my energy around. It\\u2019s funny.\"],[\"I am outside. I keep going into a building but I\\u2019m not supposed to be inside because it\\u2019s reserved for other people. A convention or something is happening. I see my hula halau there - my kumu hula and all my hula sisters. They\\u2019re going to do a show. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome dance with us.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and am like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember any of the dances.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don\\u2019t remember the dances. They also don\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s like we haven\\u2019t practiced in a long time and we haven\\u2019t gotten together in a long time. But we\\u2019re all getting together for this. I feel so awkward. It\\u2019s really just affording me a reason for me to be in this building that I need or just want to be in. I\\u2019m not sure why. The halau is getting ready. I think I\\u2019m still in costume. I hide from them. I climb up a balcony or something. I\\u2019m not even taking stairs. I\\u2019m climbing things and definitely trespassing. I get to a classroom and it\\u2019s a kindergarten classroom. All the kindergarten decor is in there. I\\u2019m hiding in there. I think the teacher is trying to get the classroom ready because there aren\\u2019t a lot of kids. But there are some kids, so I think maybe it\\u2019s a school. I need to use the bathroom and it\\u2019s a little kid\\u2019s bathroom so the toilet is just two feet off the ground. I come out and have these feelings that I shouldn\\u2019t be here but don\\u2019t know why I need to be there. I head out of the classroom and climb back down and head back to the hula sisters. We do perform but I don\\u2019t know if I actually perform with them or watch. I wake up with this sense of not knowing what\\u2019s going on, I shouldn\\u2019t be here, I don\\u2019t have the skills, I don\\u2019t remember the dances, and none of this is my scene.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Josh, my beloved. We\\u2019re going to a Dane Cook show - the compedian (I haven\\u2019t listened to his shit in at least ten years). We\\u2019re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It\\u2019s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They\\u2019re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It\\u2019s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he\\u2019s done. I\\u2019m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it\\u2019s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term \\u201csausage fest\\u201d is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I\\u2019m a little confused as to why I\\u2019m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he\\u2019s finished with the set. He\\u2019s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, \\u201cWell, because you\\u2019re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, whatever!\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don\\u2019t know if Josh is still with me. I\\u2019m watching a soccer game. It\\u2019s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They\\u2019re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I\\u2019m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I\\u2019m not playing, I\\u2019m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I\\u2019m not sure who the team is that we\\u2019re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I\\u2019m wanting to play so bad. We\\u2019re outdoors at a soccer field and I\\u2019m actually sitting under a tree, it\\u2019s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I\\u2019m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I\\u2019m not playing and I\\u2019m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I\\u2019m not invited to play and it\\u2019s been a really long time since I\\u2019ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there\\u2019s busy work that has to happen. I\\u2019m watching the field morph. I can\\u2019t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I\\u2019m not part of it and I\\u2019m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don\\u2019t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. There\\u2019s my other friend Nani who I\\u2019ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m busy and I\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d She does sit with me for a little bit. While we\\u2019re sitting there, another girl comes up - I\\u2019m saying \\u201cgirl\\u201d because everyone is a teenager - and she\\u2019s got a project she\\u2019s working on. I ask her to show me. There\\u2019s wire wrapped around a needle and she\\u2019s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: \\u201cI can show you but I\\u2019m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.\\u201d It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s almost off work with the job she\\u2019s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she\\u2019s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, \\u201cOkay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you\\u2019re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.\\u201d She\\u2019s a local girl, so I can feel this air of \\u201cIck, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?\\u201d That\\u2019s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a neighborhood. It\\u2019s very Norman Rockwell style with white picket fences. Everyone has their house decorated for fall with pumpkins on porches and chrysanthemums, but it\\u2019s still warm out. It hasn\\u2019t turned cold yet. The leaves haven\\u2019t changed yet. It\\u2019s late September, maybe. I\\u2019m going through the neighborhood trying to find a pumpkin. I\\u2019m chasing it - it\\u2019s really big. It is bouncing around like a beachball. There are cars that I\\u2019m passing as I run down the roads chasing this pumpkin. It\\u2019s all residential and I\\u2019m chasing it through the neighborhood. I get this sense that someone else is helping me find or get the pumpkin. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m going to do with it once I get it or why I\\u2019m chasing it in the first place. Somewhere in the background I can feel my beloved\\u2019s presence. I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s helping me or what.\"],[\"I am with my ex and his dad and some other family members, maybe some are my family members. I have to go do something but I\\u2019ve forgotten all my stuff. I turn to my ex and ask him to go get the things that I\\u2019m missing. The whole time I\\u2019m asking him, part of me is like, \\u201cWhy are you asking him for things? He can\\u2019t give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to give you things. He doesn\\u2019t want to do anything for you. Don\\u2019t ask him. Just do the things. If you do, you\\u2019ll owe him and that will make things worse.\\u201d I keep seeing this backpack full of things. He either has it or I have it, I\\u2019m not entirely sure. He does bring it to me. But the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, don\\u2019t accept this from him because then you will owe and you\\u2019ll never be free of him.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re younger, maybe early twenties. We\\u2019re gathered from all parts of the globe. It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There\\u2019s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cFor all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I signed up to be a bad guy.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We\\u2019re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She\\u2019s down below me and there\\u2019s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I\\u2019m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I\\u2019m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from \\u201cLilo and Stitch.\\u201d She\\u2019s talking to it and petting it while she\\u2019s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn\\u2019t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn\\u2019t have one, but I said, \\u201cThanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.\\u201d He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly understand that this meeting was about who was going to end up with one of those animals, like what she has. She moves on. I stand up and follow her into the kitchen. She\\u2019s moving as if she\\u2019s very busy and has to move onto the next task. The kitchen is also an office and there\\u2019s a huge fish tank. She is already giving instructions to someone else. I come up to her and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one of those things that you guys can create for me.\\u201d She stops talking and has a grin on her face and is like, \\u201cWell actually, you my dear, have enough power for three of these.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little taken aback and surprised. This woman has dark hair and reminds me a little bit of Helen but she\\u2019s not. They correlate to emotional superpowers, one is my ability to laugh and smile - at some point this thing smiled at me with all its sharp pointy teeth. She says, \\u201cYes, and you have two others.\\u201d There's something about shadow and something about fighting, warrior spirit. We all pile into cars and drive somewhere. I\\u2019m with my friend from the grocery store. We drive to a large gathering for all of us.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outdoors somewhere and there are a bunch of homeless people. I think it might be a homeless camp. I think there\\u2019s a river nearby. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m there because initially I was supposed to go and help move them from where they were. But when I get there, I realize they just need a home and supplies and they just need to be taken care of. I give them whatever supplies I have in my car and end up leaving the car there (I think it\\u2019s the Chevy Volt that I have). I also have my kids with me, I think. We head towards a big farmhouse down the dirt road. There are fields of grass and fences along the side. We get to the house. It belongs to somebody I know, maybe my parents. Now I have my kids and my daughter\\u2019s friend. Josh is there, too. I\\u2019m getting something ready for all of us and I keep remembering one more thing, then one more thing, then one more thing. Eventually Josh is like, \\u201cWe gotta go.\\u2019 He takes the kids and puts them all in the car then drives off. I have this funny little Chevy Volt, a tiny tiny car, and it\\u2019s left for me to drive. It actually looks more like a Flinstone\\u2019s car. I keep gathering stuff up and as I\\u2019m heading out the door I see all these northern flicker feathers (they are orange on one side and black on the other) and some black and white feathers that look like striped zebras. They\\u2019re so many of them as I\\u2019m trying to get in the car. I keep hearing the ancestors saying, \\u201cPick them up. Those offerings are for you. Pick them up.\\u201d There are maybe twelve feathers and they\\u2019re actually longer than flicker feathers because they\\u2019re the length of my forearm. I keep picking them up and picking them up, and wondering what does all this mean and why are there so many feathers. In the meantime, I\\u2019m thinking in the background that I have to go and I have to catch up with Josh and the kids. I\\u2019ve gotta get going, but I\\u2019m picking up these feathers and it\\u2019s so important that I have them and I keep them with me in this Flinstone\\u2019s car that I\\u2019m driving. The dream ends with me gathering up the last of them and trying to get in the car.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to this party or dance. I distinctly remember feeling like I did in high school when I was getting ready for high school dances - the anticipation and excitement. This dance is a larger party. I know I\\u2019m going to see my friend Janet from high school. I\\u2019m really excited about it. I walk into the house where it\\u2019s at and she\\u2019s right in the foyer. We\\u2019re both so happy to see each other. We throw our hands up in the air and hug each other hello. It\\u2019s so good to see her. Janet is shorter than me. I haven\\u2019t seen her in at least ten years. She\\u2019s happy to see me. I\\u2019m happy to see her. I\\u2019m a little bit surprised that she\\u2019s happy to see me, but it\\u2019s fun to be reunited. Then I go into the rest of the party. It\\u2019s interesting because I don\\u2019t really know the rest of the people there. I\\u2019m mingling and having a good time. Then my beloved Josh is there. I don\\u2019t know if I came with him or not. But he\\u2019s there and hitting on chicks, getting to know people as he does. I see him take one off to go fuck or do whatever they do. I say something to him like, \\u201cHey, take the condom.\\u201d I watch them go off. Then I turn around and look for anyone I\\u2019d like to fuck. I think not really. Some of them are old high school classmates, but others I don\\u2019t know. Interesting thing is, this house is owned by my friend\\u2019s ex. He owns the house and he\\u2019s the host. He has all this money and the house is really big with tall windows. The living room is really open and the windows slide open like patio doors, but they\\u2019re taller than patio doors. You can see that his yard is gorgeous and two houses down is an empty lot. New houses are being built there. There\\u2019s water off the backside of this house - it\\u2019s a canal of some sort. The party is still happening and I go out the front doors to the garden. The garden looks a lot like my old garden in Corvallis where I had turned over the soil and made the garden a small section of the front yard, so I could still have a path. I go over to the soil. There\\u2019s a bunch of little kids and it\\u2019s like a Waldorf school is having an outdoor class and they\\u2019re learning about gardening. But this area where the garden is has big holes like a dog had been digging. It\\u2019s dug down to where there\\u2019s black plastic that has been put down to create a barrier between where there was grass and all the new rich nutrients that had been put on top. There\\u2019s nothing growing in the garden right now; it\\u2019s just the black dirt and mulch and all these holes. I look into all the holes and all of them have something slightly different in them. One hole has pens, one hole has an old dog leash and collar, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think we want those in there if we\\u2019re going to be growing stuff.\\u201d I reach down to grab these things out. The kids are very intently looking to see what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m just removing the trash from this garden area that hasn\\u2019t been used. It needs clean up, that\\u2019s for sure, and nothing is growing in it. I have a recollection of the owner of the lot saying, \\u201cOh yeah, I think I should just buy this other lot two houses down, then I can have an even bigger house.\\u201d The way he says it, he\\u2019s being a pompous ass. I don\\u2019t get it. I don\\u2019t know who he\\u2019s showing off for and I don\\u2019t know why he needs another house two houses down.\"],[\"I am hosting a party. I\\u2019m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There\\u2019s a fireplace. There\\u2019s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I\\u2019m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We\\u2019re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they\\u2019re here at the party for a reason, but there\\u2019s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don\\u2019t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what\\u2019s up. They\\u2019ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There\\u2019s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what\\u2019s being discussed, but it seems like there\\u2019s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don\\u2019t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what\\u2019s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we\\u2019ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. Let\\u2019s do that. We\\u2019ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.\\u201d It must be cold outside because there\\u2019s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What\\u2019s funny is they didn\\u2019t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it\\u2019s freezing. So there\\u2019s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don\\u2019t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they\\u2019ll put them near the fire. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I\\u2019ll just go put them in the fire.\\u201d But the shoes don\\u2019t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they\\u2019re wearing are mismatched. There\\u2019s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There\\u2019s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I\\u2019m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It\\u2019s like somehow we\\u2019ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it\\u2019s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they\\u2019re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it\\u2019s just me in the end. I\\u2019m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can\\u2019t remember what the changes are now. I\\u2019m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I\\u2019m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not a good idea. You\\u2019re a woman, this isn\\u2019t a good idea for you.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they\\u2019re leaving telling him: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She\\u2019s going to do what she\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn\\u2019t have to say and stop trying to control her. I\\u2019m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn\\u2019t being heard by my dad. I couldn\\u2019t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I\\u2019m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I\\u2019m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss\\u2019 artwork but the customer\\u2019s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I\\u2019m printing it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t your artwork.\\u201d She comes and looks at it and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely not.\\u201d There are huge instructions in the order and I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cNo. We don\\u2019t print other people\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m not going to do this.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d We look over and there are packages with more of this customer\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.\\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I\\u2019m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they\\u2019re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, \\u201cOh, who is that?!\\u201d My friend is there, too, and I think she\\u2019s in the room with somebody, but she\\u2019s not because she\\u2019s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn\\u2019t her. We\\u2019re all like, \\u201cWho was that?!\\u201d We walk down the hall and it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don\\u2019t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey can I get one of those? I want a turn!\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he\\u2019s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I look at him like, \\u201cCan I get a turn?\\u201d and he blushes and is like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the living room of my childhood home. There are a ton of people coming and going; some of them are my siblings, some are my siblings\\u2019 classmates, and I think some are my classmates, too. They\\u2019re all on a mission of some sort. I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing, but they\\u2019re coming home from some event they were at or some project they were doing. There are a lot of people, at least twenty, in the living room and more people outside. At one point I see a huge outrigger canoe being rolled through the yard and into the living room, which magically expands to fit it. I\\u2019m lying on a couch and pretty tired. I\\u2019m exhausted and just watching them come and go. People are stopping to talk with me but I\\u2019m not really involved in whatever is happening or whatever mission they seem to be on. At one point I sit up and look out to the driveway and the hedge that separates our house from the neighbor house. Behind the hedge is a gigantic tree with a treehouse in it. It looks like an oak tree in the way the trunk and branches are growing but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an oak because this is Hawaii. I\\u2019m watching people climb up and down the tree - it\\u2019s a treehouse but also an obstacle course with places where you can work out. It\\u2019s all somehow in this tree. I\\u2019m watching other people working out. Then I see a real tiger, orange and black, climb the tree and do the workout. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhoa, I didn\\u2019t know tigers could move like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m watching the tiger the whole time because I\\u2019m fascinated by what it\\u2019s doing and how it can do it, and also that it seems to be listening to the people. It\\u2019s as if it\\u2019s taking instructions from the humans - maybe not verbally, but from watching and then doing what they\\u2019re doing. Then the tiger climbs out of the tree and I think it\\u2019s going into the house through the backdoor. It\\u2019s at the backdoor and doing pullups on this pullup bar in the door. I see my brother (the one with the sustained traumatic brain injury in real life, but in the dream he\\u2019s normal and doesn\\u2019t have it). He is trying to pick up the tiger and use the tiger as a weight. The tiger is getting pissed off about this and doesn\\u2019t like it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMaybe you should put the tiger down.\\u201d He figures it out on his own. This whole time, the tiger is the most fascinating thing even though there are other people around. The tiger is acting like a tiger but also like a human. At some point it does come up to me and I just look at it and it looks at me, but I don\\u2019t hear anything and it doesn\\u2019t give me any verbal messages. I just know we have a moment of looking at each other. This part of the dream dissolves. Now I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood. I\\u2019m young, maybe five or six. There are two houses. I go into one house and there are a bunch of younger kids and two dads. I\\u2019m now my current age. The moms are not there and the dads don\\u2019t know how to feed the kids. They\\u2019re both watching tv, but then they see me and are like, \\u201cOh good! A woman to take care of things.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? No.\\u201d I walk out of the house. Then I walk down the street in this neighborhood -I\\u2019m definitely in the suburbs. I walk into the second house. This house is dark and dingy. There\\u2019s at least one man in here and maybe some kids. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw, danger.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to be in there. I can tell it\\u2019s not the place for me. There\\u2019s nothing here for me. This whole time I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood, I\\u2019m looking for something but I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m looking for. I do know that this house is not it. I leave that house and go back to the other house. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well I guess I will help you guys out because you\\u2019re better than the other house.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat, we need a pie made.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOkay, well show me all the stuff.\\u201d As soon as I say yes to making the pie, the dads pulls out this box of frozen foods they weren\\u2019t feeding the kids until they had permission from me. It\\u2019s a box of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fish sticks and frozen pizzas - basically junk food. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cGreat now we can eat all this stuff and feed the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAh god, this is a terrible idea. Where is the stuff to make the pie. I\\u2019ll make the pie and at least that will be good.\\u201d They show me this piece of cardboard with perforated cutouts of leaves and vines. I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with it but I start pushing those through because I think I\\u2019ll maybe use them for the pie. Then the dads want to start talking business and how they\\u2019re going to pay me for this work. They hand me a leather jump rope with wooden handles. It\\u2019s folded four times. I have it in my hands and they\\u2019re talking about payment. As I\\u2019m listening I think they\\u2019ve got it all wrong. They don\\u2019t know how much labor is worth or how the pay schedule works. I\\u2019m talking about financial investments and using the jump rope to help explain. I\\u2019m untying the rope to show them how payment works. This is the most bizarre part of the dream because I don\\u2019t remember what I was saying or how a jump rope relates to finance, but somehow it did.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Aila and dropping her kids off at her house. I have my kids with me, too. We come up to the front drive. I head inside with both of them to say goodbye. She\\u2019s mother henning me and fussing with me and wanting to give me all kinds of things and make sure I have enough food adn things to take home with me. I say goodbye to her two kids who are now lying on the couch. I see how she welcomes them home and they\\u2019re so happy to see her. She has things to hand them and things for them to do to keep them occupied and things for them to do together as a family. I\\u2019m following her around her house and it doesn\\u2019t look like her actual home in this realm, but it is her home. I follow her into the kitchen and she gives me food and tea and makes sure I\\u2019m warm. Then I go to leave and am saying my goodbyes. I walk out the back door and start going down this road, but I realize I left my car in her front yard parked next to her car. I\\u2019m heading down this road and it\\u2019s really comfortable and gorgeous - it\\u2019s where I\\u2019d rather be. Halfway down the road I realize I need to turn around and go get my car. So, I turn around and head back to her house. I\\u2019m coming up to the house from the back. It\\u2019s got a lot of outbuildings and this is the side of the house that isn\\u2019t used for very much. Austin is there, too - her partner, a big tall cowboy. He says hi to me and we spend a little time together. As I come back up to the house I see that she\\u2019s with our other friend Beth. They\\u2019re looking for articles of clothing for a photoshoot. Beth has all these cute pieces, but they look like they\\u2019re from a thrift shop - like big floral skirts made out of sheets. I am admiring and remarking on how those two can make anything fashionable, including old sheets, for photoshoots and whatnot. I can also tell I\\u2019m in the way, so I\\u2019m trying to go through the house and out the front door to my car. Aila is still super hospitable and saying hello. She has other things set up for the kids; I think they\\u2019re watching a show or something. The show is a documentary on anti-racism work or something like that. She\\u2019s so welcoming, even though I\\u2019m back at her house after having gone the wrong way and taking my leave. I feel super awkward and I can tell her that her and Beth have some business to do, and I\\u2019m the way of that, too. I\\u2019m trying to go out the front door so I can get to my car. I stop and say goodbye to Austin. I\\u2019m on the porch and saying goodbye again and really wanting to take my leave so I can get out of her hair. But she\\u2019s still so welcoming. I do hop in my car and leave and drive off on this other road that is parallel to the one in the back. I don\\u2019t like this front road as much. It\\u2019s a busy street and I just don\\u2019t feel as comfortable out on this road.\"],[\"I am in a parking lot. I think it's where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I\\u2019ve driven there for something, I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m reversed into a parking stall and I\\u2019m not sure what kind of car mine is. There\\u2019s another call a few stalls down, I think it\\u2019s a black Honda Civic. Then a few parking stalls down are a bunch of construction workers working on something. There are cut pieces of wood and sawdust everywhere. I\\u2019m not sure what they\\u2019re working on but they\\u2019re in my psychic space, making noise and part of the dream, but I\\u2019m not too focused on them, except trying to make sure I stay out of their way. I\\u2019m going through stuff in the trunk of my car. I\\u2019m rummaging through it and trying to reorganize everything. I have bags with clothes and shoes and all kinds of things in the car. So I\\u2019m trying to find something but also trying to reorganize everything. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding stuff and I realize it\\u2019s because I\\u2019m looking in the other car, my boss\\u2019 car, the black Honda Civic. I\\u2019m in the trunk of that one. There\\u2019s a pair of black high heels with bows on the front - they\\u2019re not mine, they\\u2019re hers. I\\u2019m moving them around and hen I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWait a second, no wonder I can\\u2019t find anything, I\\u2019m in the wrong car.\\u201d So I go back to my car and I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes or something. My car is broken down. I finish rummaging in the back then go up to this kiosk in the parking lot. It\\u2019s a place where you can write a claim so you can get your car fixed. There are a bunch of other people around - a family with some kids and an older lady with white hair. They\\u2019ve all already written claims and are waiting for the next step or they\\u2019re waiting in line to write their claims. It\\u2019s kind of crowded. There\\u2019s a younger woman behind the desk at the kiosk. She\\u2019s telling everybody what to do, where to go, and what to fill out. She gives me this ticket and I go to fill it out but the ticket is printed wrong. The places where you put your name and address are tilted on the ticket and not in a straight line. And the background of the ticket, instead of being blank has a watermark that is repeated along the whole ticket, so it\\u2019s hard to write anything down. I\\u2019m looking at the ticket and looking at her and am like, \\u201cIs this the thing I need to get my car fixed? Will this help?\\u201d This parking for this gigantic building, almost a skyscraper. To the left of the kiosk is this skyscraper and to my right is a hedge. It\\u2019s like this is a parking lot where you can park then go walk downtown. I\\u2019m noticing the trees. The trees are red, so it\\u2019s fall. It\\u2019s a somewhat disjointed dream because it\\u2019s an urban landscape and I don\\u2019t really know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m trying to get accomplished. I think I'm trying to get my car fixed. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m with Josh and two other people, I\\u2019m not sure who they are. We\\u2019re in this futuristic seeming town or city. The colors are white and blue, all different shades of lighter blue. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. Josh just decides he\\u2019s totally horny and grabs me by the hips and bends me over so he can fuck me from behind. But we\\u2019re on the street and on a set of stairs going up to a building. The buildings are low, not skyscrapers. There are no plants anywhere, but if there are, they are shades of white and blue. There\\u2019s just this entrance to a building where we stop at. I think that maybe we\\u2019re traveling with this other couple but I\\u2019m not sure where and I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re doing.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching my daughter from the edges of an ice rink. She\\u2019s ice skating and doing a show. I think we were there for practice but it ends up being a show. She\\u2019s in costume. There are a bunch of other ice skaters who are her teammates. They\\u2019re on the ice in the background. Then there\\u2019s one male ice skater. The others are all lined up and my daughter is in front of them. The one male ice skater comes around and as part of the show pulls her jacket off down around her arms and her body is that of a full grown woman. It\\u2019s a very sexual sensual move and I\\u2019m pissed off because she\\u2019s still a thirteen year old and she\\u2019s being super hyper sexualized in this show. I\\u2019m so mad. Her coaches are there critiquing because it is a rehearsal for the show. My daughter skates forward to do her move and something happens that I don\\u2019t quite see and she falls to the ice. Something happens to one of her legs. I\\u2019m so mad and I go grab her to make sure she\\u2019s okay. But this is not an appropriate show for a young girl to be doing. Then everybody goes home. I have her and her brother, too. Their dad is there, too. He\\u2019s been watching. I\\u2019m trying to spend time with the two kids because I haven\\u2019t seen them in a long time. I gather them both up in my arms and hold onto them and snuggle them. Their dad leaves and gives me some time with me. I try to connect. It\\u2019s a little awkward but there is some connection. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to go,\\u201d and he takes the kids with him. I\\u2019m following them out. We head out of the building where the ice skating rink is. Now I\\u2019m in this marina, so there are boats and everyone has a dock for their boats. The boats are coming back and forth, but people are also swimming in the water. There are set times when there are no boats and people can swim. Then there is time for the boats when you can\\u2019t swim because you\\u2019d get run over. I\\u2019m showing some of the kids in our group how to swim. I\\u2019m not sure who all is with us. A few people in their boats start to go boating when it\\u2019s still swimming time. People are yelling at the swimmers to get out of the water so they don\\u2019t get run over. I see this boat coming right up the lane and I flatten myself as much as I can on the floor of the marina - I think it\\u2019s a lake floor - so I don\\u2019t get chopped up by their propellers. I get up and people start dragging me out of the water once the boat passes over. I\\u2019m horrified that no one is being careful and that we\\u2019re in the water while boating is happening. We get out of the water. Somebody\\u2019s wedding is being prepped and they\\u2019ve asked me as a friend to come and help with it. Each of their friends are taking turns helping with the wedding. I think each of us has a day that we\\u2019re helping to prep. I get my day and I have a list. I don\\u2019t know who these friends are and I don\\u2019t even know who the friends of the friends are. It's a very strange situation because I don't know who I was just partying with at the marina and I don\\u2019t know whose wedding this is. I get a list of all the things that have been assigned to me to prep for this wedding. I walk through this door that will be the aisle we walk down, but the timing is bad because when we walk through it sets off an alarm that downs a bunch of trees right over the entrance and blocks it. It\\u2019s like when a castle is under siege and you\\u2019re pulling oil over people\\u2019s heads. The building or place has a protection mechanism; it reminds me of Hogwarts in the last movie. So all these trees come down right in front of me. The couple who is getting married is like, \\u201cThere goes my aisle to walk down.\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll clean up the trees and the other people can do the other stuff on the list.\\u201d I go to do that, but I think I get interrupted. Someone stops me to help them with something, but I go, \\u201cYeah, but I really have to move these trees.\\u201d The trees were dead to begin with and they weren\\u2019t actually trees, they were really big logs that have come across this doorway. The doorway is little; it\\u2019s like a one person doorway that you would go in and out of, say through your bedroom or something. But there is a red carpet that leads out from it, but now it\\u2019s covered in logs. These logs are white, either birch or aspen that have been cut and fallen. This dream ends with me being pulled away from this job to assist the bride. I\\u2019m sitting in a circle on a bench and there\\u2019s a woman with a white dress on. Her train is huge and beautiful. Her dress is very beautiful and sparkly, probably with sequins.\"],[\"I\\u2019m looking at my phone and I\\u2019m with Josh and getting texts from Hank. Hank and Wendy used to co-own the CrossFit gym I used to go to. Hank is texting me about meeting up with him. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with him and think it\\u2019s weird that he\\u2019s even texting me. I say yes even though I don\\u2019t know what he wants. The scene shifts from me looking at my phone to being at a coffee shop. I\\u2019m with Josh and we\\u2019re hanging out. I have this feeling that Hank is going to meet up with me here and Wend6 is going to be there, too. I don\\u2019t want to meet up with them and don\\u2019t know why I agreed to meet with them. But I very distinctly remember seeing the text message where I said, \\u201cOkay great,\\u201d to Hank\\u2019s request to meet me somewhere. They both show up. I see Wendy first. She doesn\\u2019t seem like herself. She\\u2019s actually really happy and her hair is dyed blond. She has a smile on her face. She says hi to me. I\\u2019m wary like who is this and why is she saying hi. But she says hi then goes on with her business. She has her kids and she\\u2019s meeting a friend. Hank shows up and goes to give me a creepy hug like he used to give me. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh don\\u2019t, Josh is right there and he\\u2019s not going to like that. I don\\u2019t even know why I\\u2019m meeting with you and why I said yes. Don\\u2019t hug me in that creepy way.\\u201d The hug is like the lingering kind with lingering hands. Hank is also really happy to see me. I\\u2019m hesitant and I can see that Josh is wondering what\\u2019s going on here. Josh is looking less and less like himself as the dream progresses. He\\u2019s sitting at a table sitting out towards the coffee shop on a bench. There\\u2019s a chair on the other side of the table facing him and the chair is where I was going to sit, but that\\u2019s where Hank wants to sit and talk. I have all this hesitation about meeting up with them. Then the scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a Jeep. I'm driving around. It\\u2019s either Wendy\\u2019s or somebody\\u2019s. Josh is in the passenger seat and he\\u2019s upset and is like, \\u201cWhy did you meet with them?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember the gist of the conversation, just the feeling that he wasn\\u2019t happy with me and I was confused that I would agree to meet with them and confused by their super friendly reaction to me when I don\\u2019t think they would be friendly in real life.\"],[\"There are three or four black women, I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re actresses. They\\u2019re going on stage. One is stunningly beautiful and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who needs to be on stage.\\u201d I keep wanting to build her up and make sure she knows how beautiful she is. For some reason she\\u2019s not seeing how beautiful she is. I\\u2019m trying to convince her through showing her.Then I have berries which look like blueberries. I\\u2019ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don\\u2019t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I\\u2019m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don\\u2019t know who. I\\u2019m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I\\u2019m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it\\u2019s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard. I can see this cartoonish looking town through the branches and it\\u2019s dark and there are lights on. The roads are very hilly and windy.\"],[\"I am talking to a detective who I\\u2019m hiring to go watch my ex-father-in-law and my dad who are supposed to be taking turns watching my son who is an infant. They\\u2019re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don\\u2019t work. The reason I\\u2019m hiring this detective is because I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re watching my son very well and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s entirely safe. They\\u2019re watching him for me because I\\u2019m working and I don\\u2019t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They\\u2019re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It\\u2019s odd that they\\u2019re together because they don\\u2019t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they\\u2019re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who\\u2019s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they\\u2019re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I\\u2019m observing this whole thing. I\\u2019m on the pool deck somewhere but they don\\u2019t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They\\u2019re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you\\u2019re both talking shit about me and the fact that I\\u2019m not around to watch my son and it\\u2019s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I\\u2019m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can\\u2019t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law\\u2019s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn\\u2019t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.\\u201d My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There\\u2019s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I\\u2019m having them watch my son in the first place. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson\\u2019s mom to him. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I\\u2019m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, \\u201cPick a spot.\\u201d All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that\\u2019s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don\\u2019t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it\\u2019s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they\\u2019re taking the exam. I don\\u2019t have my books. In fact I didn\\u2019t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I\\u2019m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don\\u2019t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I\\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don\\u2019t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn\\u2019t miss too much and I could just get someone else\\u2019s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.\"],[\"I was at a beach with a couple of friends and the only one I recognize is my friend, who is a lifestyle dom and I\\u2019ve really had a good time observing her and working with her and getting to know about being a dom from her. In the dream we are at the ocean. We\\u2019re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it\\u2019s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I\\u2019m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She\\u2019s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We\\u2019re on a culdesac. It\\u2019s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I\\u2019m not sure whose. I\\u2019m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it\\u2019s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I\\u2019m not sure. There are adults and kids. I\\u2019m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I\\u2019m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I\\u2019m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cCould you hurry up? You\\u2019re taking a long time and why do you need that?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBecause I like it.\\u201d Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn\\u2019t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don\\u2019t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there\\u2019s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn\\u2019t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, \\u201cWhy am I taking off this thing that I like?\\u201d I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn\\u2019t like it and was all judgmental about it. The dream ends there with that going through my head.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a friend from the pole studio and we\\u2019re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it\\u2019s not even a possibility for me. We\\u2019re both running around looking for a pole to buy that\\u2019s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It\\u2019s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there\\u2019s no place to workout. We\\u2019re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it\\u2019s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can\\u2019t find what we\\u2019re looking for. I dream some more but don\\u2019t remember what it was. Suddenly I\\u2019m with a Native American man. He\\u2019s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I\\u2019m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don\\u2019t recognize anybody I\\u2019m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they\\u2019ve bonded somehow. I\\u2019m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We\\u2019re in the forest somewhere. He\\u2019s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, \\u201cYou have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why that\\u2019s important but that\\u2019s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I\\u2019m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we\\u2019re protesting capitalism, basically. We\\u2019re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We\\u2019re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that\\u2019s happening with these young kids and how they\\u2019re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh are we going to go in and stop them?\\u201d but the man is like, \\u201cNope, we\\u2019re just going to listen and we\\u2019re going to make food.\\u201d We\\u2019re making food to bring. There\\u2019s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it\\u2019s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I\\u2019m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We\\u2019re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that\\u2019s different from what\\u2019s being taught and told about at this parade. We\\u2019re doing a silent protest. I\\u2019m freaking out because it\\u2019s children that they\\u2019re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can\\u2019t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It\\u2019s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that\\u2019s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we\\u2019re seeing or if we\\u2019re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there\\u2019s this younger dad who\\u2019s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that\\u2019s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, \\u201cYou have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn\\u2019t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, \\u201cOh, I have magic powers? I\\u2019m going to show you my magic powers.\\u201d All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don\\u2019t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it\\u2019s hurting my people and other people. He\\u2019s just so enraged, he\\u2019s lost it. He doesn\\u2019t care who he hurts. I\\u2019m horrified because I\\u2019m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can\\u2019t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won\\u2019t stop. I finally go, \\u201cOkay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What\\u2019s really going on?\\u201d He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won\\u2019t talk to him and he hasn\\u2019t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she\\u2019s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it\\u2019s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, \\u201cAre you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?\\u201d He\\u2019s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they\\u2019re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he\\u2019s so hurt and wounded. We\\u2019re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we\\u2019re conversing we\\u2019re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He\\u2019s an older man, he\\u2019s bald and he\\u2019s wearing all black. He says to me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.\\u201d For whatever reason I see him and am like, \\u201cOh my god, oh no.\\u201d I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I\\u2019m in a towel, I don\\u2019t have my clothes on and don\\u2019t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I\\u2019m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It\\u2019s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn\\u2019t warn them and don\\u2019t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I\\u2019m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don\\u2019t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn\\u2019t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that\\u2019s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren\\u2019t even ground up. I\\u2019m eating in a safe place where this man can\\u2019t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.\\u201d I need to get clothes but I\\u2019m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don\\u2019t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m pretty incoherent. I haven\\u2019t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they\\u2019re part of the oppressor group.\"],[\"I am with one high school classmate, Janet, and some others - somebody\\u2019s parents and some other friends. We\\u2019re going to a park where we can camp and there\\u2019s also a house and cabins you can rent. We\\u2019re celebrating something. It\\u2019s very chill. There\\u2019s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there\\u2019s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you\\u2019d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you\\u2019d dive right onto the slide. It\\u2019s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it\\u2019s like a forest. There\\u2019s also an open area. We\\u2019re there celebrating and I\\u2019m actually starting to get concerned because I\\u2019m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it\\u2019s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, \\u201cUh, coronavirus is up and we\\u2019re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.\\u201d When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I\\u2019m wading into the water. I\\u2019m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it\\u2019s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it\\u2019s a shiny burnt orange color. I don\\u2019t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I\\u2019m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I\\u2019m getting uncomfortable because I\\u2019m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there\\u2019s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It\\u2019s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it\\u2019s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out. The water is pretty warm but when I come out, it\\u2019s cold, like about to start snowing cold. I bundle myself up and head back to the house that we rented. Now there are way more people in it. I\\u2019m crawling into a bed because I\\u2019m freezing. I\\u2019m first there by myself, but then all these other people show up and they crawl into the bed with me. The other people are older, like aunties and uncles and even grandmas. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope.\\u201d The sun has gone down. I change clothes so I\\u2019m warm and I go out of the house. There\\u2019s this guy, I don\\u2019t know him, maybe in his thirties with short dark hair. I noticed him by the pond earlier because he was there doing some work and he had this bronze statue of himself that was animated. He had made a copy of himself that was helping him with a project down there. When I come out of the house, he\\u2019s by the house with his bronze copy of himself. But the copy is misbehaving, it won\\u2019t do what he tells it to do. He\\u2019s trying to kill it and chop off its head in pieces. I\\u2019m a little freaked out by the whole thing because I get this eerie feeling that if he doesn\\u2019t do something about that copy of himself it\\u2019s going to wreak havoc on everybody and just start killing everyone. At some point, he manages to get control of it and chops it into pieces and puts it on a tarp and wraps the tarp up. I\\u2019m kind of grossed out by the whole thing. I don\\u2019t know what he does with the tarp. He\\u2019s definitely a musician because i see him go from there to setting up a ritual space. He brings all the elements in. He has rings on his fingers. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing and what he\\u2019s setting up. The dream shifts. I end up traveling somewhere else. I\\u2019m traveling with Josh. he\\u2019s feeling super beat down and his self esteem is in the toilet. He\\u2019s picking at acne on his body so badly that it\\u2019s leaving holes in his skin. He\\u2019s super fucking depressed. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re traveling to or from. I don\\u2019t even know what kind of vehicle we\\u2019re in but there are seats. I\\u2019m in a seat and he\\u2019s in a seat next to me. There\\u2019s seaglass, round and smooth, and some are pretty big like the size of the palm of my hand. They\\u2019re all different colors, red and purple and greens and blues. There are smaller pieces, too. It\\u2019s gorgeous and it\\u2019s his personal collection. I\\u2019m trying to hang onto this glass while we\\u2019re in this vehicle. At some point we\\u2019re flying because I look out the window and see clouds below us, but we\\u2019re also driving. I put the glass down and all of a sudden the vehicle accelerates and the glass falls off the shelf I put it on and shatters into so many tiny pieces on the metal of the floor of this vehicle. Josh is ambivalent about it and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, all of your glass!\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified because I put it there and it broke, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really care.\\u201d I\\u2019m super upset about it breaking and I feel bad. I\\u2019m also upset that he doesn\\u2019t care. I sweep up all the little shards and we put them in the trash. There are a few tiny pieces left and I gather those up and hang onto them. We get to where we\\u2019re going and we get out of this vehicle. We end up at a weird saloon bar place. It\\u2019s dark. We meet these two women who I think were our travel companions at one point. I don\\u2019t know who they are but they\\u2019re familiar to me in the dream. One of the women has a blond braid and the other has longer dark hair. They sit down at a table and ask the bartender for this type of alcohol that you usually need one shot of and you\\u2019re good. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take the whole bottle.\\u201d The bartender is like, \\u201cNo you won\\u2019t.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, we will.\\u201d Josh is like, \\u201cYeah, let them have it. I\\u2019ll take care of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo! They\\u2019re going to be obnoxious and terrible.\\u201d But by the time I look back, the two women have finished the bottle and the bartender is standing there with shoulders shrugged. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no.\\u201d Of course they get crazy. Josh starts feeding off of them energetically because he doesn\\u2019t drink at all. I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cUh oh, this is not going to be good, you\\u2019re going from depressed to manic.\\u201d They\\u2019re playing on a piano. It is like a saloon. There\\u2019s nobody else in there. The bartender is like, \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re closing.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re closing? You just got these two ladies wasted and there\\u2019s no place for us to go. We\\u2019re staying here.\\u201d The dream shifts. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I\\u2019m at, maybe a Costco type area. There\\u2019s a guy, older man maybe in his fifties, pot-bellied white dude with short hair. He\\u2019s used his body his whole life to work, you can tell, his hands are super callused. He\\u2019s hungry and he\\u2019s trying to figure out what to eat that is healthy. I\\u2019m standing looking at everything in the freezer section and am like, \\u201cOkay, if you eat this, this and this, it doesn\\u2019t have any dairy.\\u201d I was trying to find food that met the restrictions he had. I say, \\u201cThis pizza has a cauliflower crust and it\\u2019s non-dairy with fake cheese. It comes with these other items in the box, so you can buy the whole thing and that\\u2019s your meal.\\u201d There\\u2019s a microwave conveniently nearby. He heats it up and eats while we\\u2019re standing in the freezer section. He puts the tray down on his shopping cart, eats and enjoys it. The whole time he\\u2019s complaining about how expensive it is for him to eat this way even though he needs to because it\\u2019s becoming life or death. He needs to start eating in a more healthy way. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cYou can complain about the money it costs to buy this food or you can complain about the money it costs for all the healthcare you\\u2019re going to need. There are ways to cut down because you can buy food at the beginning of the week and meal prep and that saves money. You have containers in the fridge you can eat.\\u201d I\\u2019m going through all this stuff I know from my nutrition degree to help him out and simplify things for him. But I don\\u2019t know who he is and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this for him. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m getting paid for it or not. It seems like a lot of energy being put into this person who keeps saying over and over again, \\u201cThis is really expensive.\\u201d Eventually I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDo you feel better?\\u201d He says yes. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s your choice. You can keep eating shit and keep feeling like shit or you can figure out how to do this. He doesn\\u2019t give me a response and I just wake up.\"],[\"This was kind of a weird dream. I\\u2019m looking for a house to buy. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m with my ex and the kids or some other family. I just know I\\u2019m with other people and we\\u2019re all looking at houses together. There\\u2019s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you\\u2019d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They\\u2019re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu\\u2019u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I\\u2019m looking and we decide not to buy it because it\\u2019s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I\\u2019m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They\\u2019ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren\\u2019t white anymore. They\\u2019ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m not comfortable with them. I\\u2019m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I\\u2019m not sure who it is; it\\u2019s a female person and we\\u2019re not really friends. It\\u2019s kind of like I\\u2019m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it\\u2019s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We\\u2019re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I\\u2019m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn\\u2019t feel a connection either, so she\\u2019s just gone. As I leave, I\\u2019m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I\\u2019m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn\\u2019t really resonance there anyway. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it\\u2019s just not for me.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Aila and her two kids. I\\u2019m not sure if my kids are around. We\\u2019re in her house and her house is gigantic because she hosts people in it. She hosts retreats in this house. The house has huge rooms and huge levels. Each level has its own set of dishes. We\\u2019re looking at all the dishes and cleaning them. One room was used and there\\u2019s a ton of dishes in the sink that need to be cleaned and put away. In another room I\\u2019m putting away props or items that had been used. There is a retreat going on, but maybe it\\u2019s not really a retreat because they seem to be friends of hers. I recognize all of them because I know a lot of her friends. They\\u2019re just here to hang out. One of the friends is setting up a tent in the yard under a bunch of trees with her daughter. Aila calls her over. Everyone starts talking for a little bit, but I don\\u2019t remember any particular conversation or how long that interaction lasted. There was a busyness with a lot of friends unpacking or doing other things. I\\u2019m in one of the rooms now with Aila and her kids. We\\u2019re cleaning up dishes. I also have this plant in my hand. I\\u2019m not sure where I got it. It has orange grasses but it doesn\\u2019t have a pot, so I'm trying to find a pot for it. One of the kiddos is cleaning this interesting bowl like a big gravy boat. All the dishes in the house are the exact same, just different shades of blue, turquoise, teal. One of the kids is cleaning this one that looks kind of like a round gravy boat. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019ll take that, it\\u2019s perfect for this plant.\\u201d I put the plant in it. Somehow I get this other plant that kind of looks like a lei. I put it over the other plant in the dish and it\\u2019s actually really pretty with the orange underneath and the one that looks like a lei with flowers. I don\\u2019t recognize the flowers and in fact, neither of these plants are like ones that I\\u2019ve seen ever in my whole existence alive on earth. Aila comes and looks. I think it upsets her because I'm smooshing the plant underneath. But I\\u2019m not sure if she\\u2019s upset but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cMaybe let\\u2019s move that to another place.\\u201d She\\u2019s very diplomatic in the way she says it. There\\u2019s more but I can\\u2019t recall.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There\\u2019s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She\\u2019s cooking. I\\u2019m trying to load the dishwasher. It\\u2019s a very complicated dishwasher and I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in. She\\u2019s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There\\u2019s enough though. I\\u2019m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever\\u2019s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, \\u201cCan you please open this?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy? I don\\u2019t drink.\\u201d Even though it\\u2019s beer, it\\u2019s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are you all drinking?\\u201d We\\u2019re at a gathering, maybe it\\u2019s Christmas or New Year\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t know, but there\\u2019s a celebration happening. Of course, it\\u2019s my family, so they\\u2019re all drinking and I\\u2019m the only one that doesn\\u2019t drink. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy am I opening this bottle for her?\\u201d I think she\\u2019s trying to give it to me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, here\\u2019s your bottle of beer-wine.\\u201d I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I\\u2019m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird\\u2019s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn\\u2019t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s not my childhood home or even my home. I think it\\u2019s my mom\\u2019s home. I\\u2019m there to see her. I think I\\u2019m my current age. I\\u2019m sitting in the corner of the kitchen where the cabinets come together. I\\u2019m sitting on the floor. She\\u2019s yelling at me. My little brothers are there. They\\u2019re little again. My brother that was born right after me is also there, but he looks like he\\u2019s maybe just out of his teenage years. So maybe I\\u2019m in my early twenties. She\\u2019s yelling at me and my two youngest brothers. My other brother and I are going to take the kids on a trip. We\\u2019re going to the grocery store. We go to the grocery store in his white Tacoma truck (he doesn\\u2019t have one in real life). My brothers are in the car with us. We go to the grocery store and get all of our supplies. Then we go to check out and my brother decides the lines are too long for him and he\\u2019s pissed off. So he decides to take the cart full of groceries and somehow get them in the truck that\\u2019s now in the store. He drives the truck through these two doors. The regular sliding doors are not an option because there are a ton of people in there and a rent-a-cop. There are these two doors on the side which I don\\u2019t think a truck can fit through, but he drives through them anyways. The truck barely makes it through. He heads out into the parking lot which is full of people. I\\u2019m pissed at him like, \\u201cYou just fucking stole groceries! And you almost run over people. We need to go back.\\u201d He circles around the huge parking lot. He\\u2019s trying to park but we\\u2019re on a side of the building with an entire school\\u2019s worth of parents and kids. The kids are running around. This is where he decides to park. I\\u2019m getting more and more pissed because at any moment the cops are going to come and arrest us for stealing groceries even though I didn\\u2019t steal them. I\\u2019m also afraid he\\u2019s going to hit some of the kids running around this parking lot. The kids are kindergarten up through fifth or eighth grade. He parks in one stall that\\u2019s totally open with no one nearby. But then he decides he doesn\\u2019t like it, pulls out of it, and goes to find another spot to park. This stall is in between a minivan and SUV that have parked next to each other, but they haven\\u2019t parked straight, so the stall in between is not large enough for the truck. They parked so that no one could park near them because their kids are running around. But he picks that stall to park in. i\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?! You\\u2019re acting entitled. You\\u2019re not paying attention to other people and your surroundings. We need to pay for these groceries.\\u201d I finally get the groceries out of the truck and there are so many that I have to get two carts, so I put them head to head, which is kind of strange. He pushes them in, but he\\u2019s trying to go in the out doors. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to go over to the side where it says, In.\\u201d Because he was trying to go In the Out, there\\u2019s chaos with the amount of people at the checkout. We can\\u2019t actually make it in so we have to go in these other doors. We have to go around to get to the cash registers and pay. We\\u2019re on our way around and I\\u2019m pushing the cart. Somehow this guy with a baby on his back and holding the hand of a toddler, I manage to trip him. Really what happens is he wasn\\u2019t paying attention as I was trying to squeeze behind him. He turns and he trips. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh, are you okay?\\u201d He gets really upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. I should have made more noise so you could hear that I was behind you. Are you okay? Is the baby okay?\\u201d He stands up and starts to yell at me and my brother because in our hurry, we don\\u2019t have our masks on. This guy also doesn\\u2019t have his mask on because he\\u2019s pulled it down around his neck. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to have to cite you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope, hang on, don\\u2019t worry. I have my mask right here.\\u201d I pull my mask out to put it on and my brother pulls his mask out to put it on. I\\u2019m thinking this guy is going to be more upset about tripping and falling, but he\\u2019s more upset about the masks.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a train with my son and he\\u2019s maybe seven or eight in the dream. It\\u2019s nighttime. I have no idea where the train is going. I do know it\\u2019s going to stop at some point for an amusement park. It\\u2019s like a haunted house. Everyone can get off the train here and go to this haunted house if they want to. That\\u2019s what happens. It\\u2019s all people I don\\u2019t know except for this one guy who I know in the dream but not in real life. He\\u2019s a shorter white guy in his thirties. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re talking about but there\\u2019s an easy camaraderie between the two of us. He does have a girlfriend and she gives me the side-eye every once in a while which is weird because I\\u2019m not interested - I\\u2019m there with my son. We\\u2019re talking about the haunted house. I see a bunch of people go through it. I\\u2019m actually not sure if it\\u2019s haunted but there are things to do in this house. It\\u2019s an attraction of some sort. I go through it with my son and there are parts that freak me out but not too badly. It\\u2019s fun. The haunted house lets out onto this huge grassy field. It\\u2019s nighttime and the stars are crazy - you can see all of them. I have a low grade anxiety because I\\u2019m wanting my son to play and run around but I\\u2019m also not wanting him to get lost or stolen by a stranger. There are kids he wants to play with so I\\u2019m letting him play but I\\u2019m also like, \\u201cStay where I can see you please.\\u201d He does run off at one point. I start to panic because I can\\u2019t see him. But the guy I\\u2019ve been talking with is like, \\u201cHey don\\u2019t worry, he\\u2019s with me and some friends. He\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d I feel alright and I go to lie on the grass in this huge field. The train is parked on the tracks and you can see the entrance and exit of the haunted house and night sky. I find a group of friends to sit down with and it\\u2019s Shiena, Connie and some other friends from high school. I sit down with them and we look up at the night sky. I am looking at this patch and am like, \\u201cUh, that is moving, there\\u2019s something there. That is a UFO.\\u201d They\\u2019re looking at it with me and are like, \\u201cYup, totally.\\u201d Some of them don\\u2019t believe me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNope, that\\u2019s a UFO. keep watching. It\\u2019s going to move.\\u201d It does and it\\u2019s really strange because what it looks like is a briefcase that\\u2019s been opened all the way up and the underside of it has been camouflage to look more like stars. I can see that it\\u2019s not stars and it\\u2019s moving and the stars are blurry and they don\\u2019t actually match the rest of the sky. I\\u2019m calling for my son now because I don\\u2019t know if this is safe and there\\u2019s a UFO. It starts to move enough that other people are like, \\u201cOh shit, that\\u2019s not just night sky and it\\u2019s kind of close.\\u201d The briefcase starts to close up so you can see the rest of the UFO ship. My son is with me and grabbing my hand and is like, \\u201cMom, mom, let\\u2019s go. He\\u2019s pulling me back into the haunted house. He gets ahead of me and I\\u2019m really panicked now because we\\u2019re all trying to get on the train. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cCome back!\\u201d I can feel the panic in my chest. I\\u2019m not freaked out about the UFO. I\\u2019m just worried about my son running off and being on this train without me and running into who knows what. That sense of panic and dread is starting to build. Then the dream switches. I\\u2019m on a short bus with a bunch of other younger girls. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m me or slightly younger. There\\u2019s a coach, but I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re coaching us on. I just know I want to pole dance. There\\u2019s another coach who is the singer-songwriter LP, who is probably the most adrogynous human being I\\u2019ve ever seen in my life. They are also my coach and maybe five feet tall so really short compared to me. The other coach is trying to get us to do drills. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay whatever, it\\u2019s practice, we\\u2019ll get our drills going.\\u201d Now we\\u2019ve gotten off the short bus but I don\\u2019t know where we drove to. We\\u2019re at a gymnasium. In the corner is something that looks like a playground on what looks like a sheet of plywood on wheels. The wheels can lock and unlock. There\\u2019s all this metal playground stuff and a pole connected to it on one side. I go to roll this out, but then I can\\u2019t get the wheels to lock. I keep going to the wrong side of the playground structure to do my pole exercises. At some point I realize I have all my rings on. I have to take my rings off and I put them on a side table that just shows up out of nowhere. All our stuff is there - our gym bags and such. I\\u2019ve got a zipper pouch that I put on the table. I leave my rings out though and I remember thinking that I should put them away so I don\\u2019t forget them. There\\u2019s another girl, someone who I grew up with in my neighborhood in Hawaii and I also went to school with her. I terrorized her and was so mean and cruel to her. I\\u2019m feeling super bad about how we used to treat her. She wants to do the pole stuff, too. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to take your rings off.\\u201d She also has her rings in a pile on this side table. The thing is, once I finally get the wheels locked after like five tries, I don\\u2019t have the strength for pole dancing. I can\\u2019t do an inversion, I can\\u2019t pull myself up, and neither can she. I also don\\u2019t have any grip, so my hands keep sliding on the pole. She keeps trying and I keep trying. Eventually I get really frustrated. The other girls on the team are doing something else, whatever team event they\\u2019re doing. A bunch of other people show up at this gym. I think it\\u2019s the football team and it\\u2019s time for their practice. We have to leave. I\\u2019m super dissatisfied because I didn\\u2019t get enough practice in. I try to roll the platform to the other side and out of the way so I can keep trying. But then I notice that the guys from this other team are watching me and it\\u2019s making me feel very uncomfortable because I feel like I\\u2019m being objectified. Now I really can\\u2019t do any tricks on the pole because I\\u2019m so uncomfortable from all of that.\"],[\"Ana and I are together with her son. We are on an adventure of some kind. We\\u2019re driving and we pull over because someone has to use the bathroom. We\\u2019re in the mountains and we find a rest stop. At the rest stop are a bunch of cattle and they\\u2019re all having babies. It\\u2019s funny because they aren\\u2019t standing up and birthing. They\\u2019ve dug holes and are dropping the babies into holes. Ana\\u2019s son is watching the whole thing and so am I. We are completely fascinated by all this birth happening all around us. The dream switches. Now I\\u2019m with my dad, siblings, and kids. We\\u2019re in a place that kind of reminds me of a Chinatown. We\\u2019re trying to find someplace to eat. We\\u2019re walking down the street and there are a lot of options. I think it\\u2019s during pandemic times because everyone has masks on and there are not a lot of places open. This part of the dream gets kind of fuzzy. I don\\u2019t know exactly what we\\u2019re going after. Funny things are happening at the restaurant when we go to order. I\\u2019m not hungry because there\\u2019s food I can\\u2019t eat. Then we find this other stand and the kitchen is gross with cockroaches everywhere and the smell of rancid oil. Then the dream switches. I am with a group of people. I only recognize one person and it\\u2019s my high school classmate. We\\u2019re a bunch of high schoolers. We\\u2019re at horse stables. There\\u2019s a European woman with an accent. She\\u2019s teaching us how to be around horses. First she does a demonstration in the arena. All of the horses are black. She\\u2019s riding the horse with no saddle, no bit, no reins. She\\u2019s showing us how to ride, basically dressage. She\\u2019s showing us and saying, \\u201cThis is very easy.\\u201d I\\u2019m talking to the group and am like, \\u201cNone of that is easy. I\\u2019ve done dressage and it\\u2019s not easy to get a horse to do perfect gaits and stop on perfect points, especially without a saddle and bit.\\u201d The woman comes out and says, \\u201cOkay, now it\\u2019s your turn.\\u201d Everyone files into the arena. At the far end is a stable with like twenty black horses. Everyone goes and gets a horse. I\\u2019m actually excited about being around the horses, but for some reason I don\\u2019t go out right away. All these classmates of mine have horses. They\\u2019re doing the hand motions that she\\u2019s showing them. There are a bunch of other trainers, men, who are keeping an eye on everyone. I\\u2019m horrified now because it\\u2019s so crowded and it\\u2019s so loud and there\\u2019s no way in hell any horse would stand there for all this noise, chaos and inexperienced people trying to get them to do things. I think the horses are put away and it\\u2019s time for us to stretch. We\\u2019re sitting in the dirt of the arena. They\\u2019re asking me how to stretch the pelvis. I\\u2019m showing them how to do a straddle and rock the pelvis forward. A man walks by and I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s our teacher or a trainer or a chaperone. He takes over from me and shows everyone how to do different stretches. Everyone follows along. Our low backs get stretched. I\\u2019m folded all the way over with my head resting on my legs and thinking, \\u201cWow, my low back has never been this flexible. Huh.\\u201d Then the dream switches again. I\\u2019m parked somewhere. I leave my car to go do something. When I come back, my ex-boyfriend is parked next to me. He\\u2019s parked crooked so I can\\u2019t open the passenger side door if I wanted to. In fact, I don\\u2019t know how he\\u2019s getting out of the car because he hasn\\u2019t left himself very much room. He gets out and he has all his stuff and he\\u2019s super happy to see me. I\\u2019m shocked and have no idea why he\\u2019s there. He walks around and puts his stuff in the back seat of my car and says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? Why are you here and what are we doing?\\u201d I have no idea how we\\u2019re suddenly here together in a parking lot in a tropical space. He says, \\u201cCome, I want to show you this island.\\u201d It\\u2019s an island where people have to boat out to live there. All the houses are gigantic. There\\u2019s an estuary that cuts the island in half so salt water flows from one end of the island to the other. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis island gets demolished by a hurricane.\\u201d It\\u2019s tropical. There\\u2019s a mix of super rich and super poor people. As we float down this center estuary I\\u2019m noticing huge houses and a huge building for a swap meet with secondhand stuff because everyone on the island reuses everything. I go into that building and look at all the items in the swap meet. I\\u2019m watching an old guy haggle for a tablecloth. The tablecloth has a stain on it and the woman who owns the place is like, \\u201cNo no, let me find you another one.\\u201d She goes off to find him another one. I\\u2019m wandering through and see a bunch of old Christmas decorations. I\\u2019m laughing and like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re on an island, who\\u2019s going to do anything with these? No one. Why are they all here? It\\u2019s junk.\\u201d I leave this area and decide to fly. My body is flying so I can see the rest of the island. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I can see green everywhere and tropical plants. It\\u2019s not a problem to fly. I\\u2019m watching people scaling cliffs and kayaking through the river. It\\u2019s paradise. The water is a beautiful crystal blue. I have no idea what happened to my ex-boyfriend, he disappeared from the dream at some point. Then at one point, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHuh, I don\\u2019t think I want to fly because I could crash land.\\u201d I remind myself that I won\\u2019t crash, though, and I\\u2019ll be fine. The dream ends with me flying over the whole island, taking it in and knowing it\\u2019s about to be wrecked by a hurricane.\"],[\"The setting is the restaurant where I worked in university. It\\u2019s a busy restaurant in a mall and they\\u2019ve changed our uniforms over again, which they used to do twice a year. Sometimes the shirts were horrible, but the bottoms were always black jeans. Only this time instead of just changing our shirts, we had to wear tights. I hated it. They showed everything - they were not even the good kind of yoga pants, they were like cheap knock offs that didn\\u2019t even hold their shape. Not only did they show everything, but they were baggy, too. I really didn\\u2019t want to wear them. I don\\u2019t know how I got away with it. I was still wearing my black jeans and other servers were starting to wear these tights. I had a whole bunch of stuff in my backpack and I put it in the office for safekeeping - not really sure why I did that, but we did have a problem with theft. Anyway, I had a bunch of my stuff in the office and they were stupid things, too - plastic knick knacks like McDonald\\u2019s toys and I had them in a plastic container, like tupperware. When I finished my shift, they were still there and I was trying to put them in my apron and there were too many of them and I was losing track. Then when I went to leave the restaurant at the end of my shift, the good owner (not the shyster one) and two of the other staff, we needed to fix something for someone\\u2019s car so that they could actually leave. And so we walked over to this other store in the mall to assist the staff member with communicating what it was that needed to be fixed. It was like a diode or something that needed to be replaced - it was this little tiny part in this series of bigger complicated parts. So we waited there with her while the part was being replaced. Oh my god, it just went on and on and on, and the person that was supposed to be fixing it kept talking to other people and chatting. And I\\u2019m like oh, I have to get out of here and why is this taking so long. And I just got really agitated and frustrated when we were there. Finally the store employee went over and flipped one switch and it recharged her diode and then we went out and we popped it under the hood of her car, and she was off. I said goodbye to the other two people and then I was walking across the parking lot with the remaining person (I know her in real life) and she was telling me that she knows she\\u2019s going to end up alone one day. And I was like: \\u201cReally? I\\u2019m shocked!\\u201d (because in real life she has a husband and two kids and they\\u2019re a beautiful family unit). And she said: \\u201cYep, my husband is either all in or all out, and I\\u2019ve just always known that one day he\\u2019s going to be gone.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be okay with that?\\u201d And she said she is. And then I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand how people can just shut off their emotions like that.\\u201d I told her about what it felt like when Omar died and said it was (and I did the math in my head in my dreams)...I said I was 28, so that was 30, no 22 years ago, and I still think about him every day. He\\u2019s never gone out of my heart, and I just don\\u2019t understand loving somebody and then just not loving them. When you love someone, they\\u2019re always a part of you. And then of course, I woke up because the emotion from that is still really strong.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Grid\\u201d In my dream last night, I\\u2019m a time traveler. The framework of the dream is set up on a grid system. I have lived in Toronto, Ontario, but I don\\u2019t live there now (for a short period of time I was there) and it\\u2019s a very easy city to get to know if you spend some time on the grid, which is a north-south-east-west system. In the dream, if you stop at a washroom or go down into the subway, you end up in a different time zone when you come out. So the whole dream is me trying to gather people together so that we\\u2019re all going into these wormholes at the same time so we don\\u2019t lose each other. The interesting thing is I keep waking up out of this dream and then going back to sleep and simply picking up where it left off. But every time I go back to sleep. I\\u2019m trying to regather the people that I was with before I woke up. The dream starts and I\\u2019m with my own family and one of the places in the grid is a restaurant, but it\\u2019s one of the older kinds of restaurants where the upstairs also has sleeping rooms for travelers. Not all of the people in that time zone are good people, so I\\u2019m warning my daughter to stay away from one of these girls because I can just tell by the look of her that she\\u2019s a thief and a prostitute. She\\u2019s sizing us up and I know if we don\\u2019t keep our money and valuables safe, she will steal from us. I\\u2019m trying to get the door of the restaurant locked because the prostitute has gone off with Omar and I don\\u2019t want her to come back in because I don\\u2019t want her to follow us through the next wormhole. So I do manage to keep the door locked and the prostitute comes out an hour later from the doorway and she has only her underwear on and her bra and she\\u2019s saying she\\u2019s desperately trying to get in and I know this is part of the trick because I can tell by her face that she\\u2019s not really upset. And I just know this. I do manage to succeed in convincing them to keep the door locked. Then I see her coming out of a different doorway about five minutes later. She gets up and she\\u2019s fully dressed and I can see in her hand that she has two different wallets, so she managed to get them from someone else, but not us. So this is going to sound funny, but it\\u2019s winter in the dream on the grid, and I\\u2019ve got my kids\\u2019 things to carry plus some supplies - food and an extra change of clothes. And my daughter is pushing me around in a shopping cart - she keeps telling me to get in with my stuff and it\\u2019s hard to push it because it\\u2019s a shopping cart and the snow keeps building up on the wheels. So we\\u2019re putting the heavy things in there and I\\u2019m having a hard time pushing it and my daughter keeps wanting me to get in there and rest, and she is pushing me around so we look like homeless people. We go into this other portal and come out on the other side and it\\u2019s a party. It\\u2019s packed with people and there are people that I know. So, one of these couples that I know are people that I know from the Sail Club, and I realize that the man is screwing around on the woman and I think, \\u201cOh no, that\\u2019s horrible!\\u201d And I wrestle with the idea of telling her. And I don\\u2019t yet because it\\u2019s a really tough decision to make and is it any of my business, and what effects of that decision will it have on others. So while I\\u2019m wrestling with that decision, I realize that she is actually aware of it and just doesn\\u2019t appear to either care or acknowledge it, so I don\\u2019t tell her. In the same scene, there\\u2019s another little girl and she\\u2019s being shadowed by a teenage girl. So the first girl is 8 and the other is maybe 16. They go into the showers and I\\u2019m standing there because I\\u2019m on this other girl because of the shadowing. So they both get into the same shower and I\\u2019m thinking this isn\\u2019t right. And then I walk in and look and they are showering together and they are undressed. I step in and open the door and I ask the younger girl, \\u201cAre you alright?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t answer me. So I glare at the other one and fierce her down and take the younger girl and put some clothes on her because her clothes have disappeared, so I\\u2019m just taking some various things and covering her up with them. I say, \\u201cIs this yours? Is this yours?\\u201d and people say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not mine,\\u201d and so I put a various eclectic wardrobe on her. And then I\\u2019m wandering around the party with her in my hand asking anyone if they know who this girl is because she doesn\\u2019t talk. People will say, \\u201cOh, I saw her with so and so,\\u201d and then the so and so won\\u2019t be there and there\\u2019s different so and so\\u2019s every time and I can\\u2019t find who this girl belongs to. But then I\\u2019m starting to get concerned that I\\u2019m getting sucked into or overly involved with the dynamics of the people at this party and I\\u2019m afraid that I will forget that I\\u2019m a time traveler and that I\\u2019ll lose my time traveler family, so I start to gather up the people that I came with - my daughter, some other nameless people who are just there, they are part of my travel group - and I\\u2019m looking for someone now. I say I need someone to take care of her for me, and this couple - the oblivious woman and the man who is screwing around on her all the time - say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take her. We\\u2019ll love her. We love everybody.\\u201d In the dream I\\u2019m not concerned that she\\u2019ll be sexually abused. I know that they are going to take care of her. They\\u2019re good people, they just have this other weird cake. And so I leave her with them and get back into the shopping cart outside of the door and we go down and I\\u2019m starting to recognize streets. I\\u2019m starting to look a lot more closely at the grid because I want to plan where we\\u2019re going and not just go into any door and be more conscious of the grid. I\\u2019m starting to feel more textures in the dream. So as I climb back in the cart, I\\u2019m feeling that the front handle of it is actually cold and it\\u2019s plastic feeling and the metal of the cart is even colder and I\\u2019m trying to pull the sleeve of my coat down over my hand so it won\\u2019t stick to it. It\\u2019s actually not that comfortable riding in it because the wheels keep getting stuck and it\\u2019s bumpy. But this is what she wants to do and I let her. We have some conversations. She\\u2019s still bothered by locking the prostitute out of the first scene, and I tell her that regardless of what we did she would still steal everyone\\u2019s wallets and she would still make the same choices and it\\u2019s not our purpose to try and change people\\u2019s choices here, but to learn the grid and to find our way through it. So I\\u2019m starting to read the signs and I\\u2019m recognizing where we are - what starts to become a sense of direction in the grid. My daughter keeps steering the cart. Now I don\\u2019t know where my consciousness goes during this - maybe I go to sleep in the dream and I wake up. Instead of staying on the grid we\\u2019ve gone off to side grid things and we\\u2019re in smaller parts because she likes them better because they are closer together and more intimate, but they don\\u2019t have any identifying characteristics. So it\\u2019s a lot harder for me to find the main patterns of the grid when she does this, but we do. So the second time I dive in and dive out, it\\u2019s me finding our way out of this non-identifiable part onto more of the main grid. And then we come to a wormhole that I know we\\u2019re supposed to go into and I don\\u2019t want to go in, so I linger outside of it. Now it\\u2019s just my daughter and I. Because she went off the grid, we lost the other people we were supposed to be traveling with. I\\u2019m hoping that by staying on the grid, we\\u2019ll find them the next time we pop up somewhere. I also think that maybe if we wait, they might pop up out of this wormhole because I think they\\u2019re going to be looking for us. So while we\\u2019re waiting around this one crossroads, I talk or make a connection with an older man. At first he\\u2019s just an older man. We just have a conversation about some kind of philosophy or something. I\\u2019m not really paying much attention to the conversation. Then we decide to go down into the wormhole and we do, and we\\u2019re staying together and I\\u2019m giving her instructions, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta make sure we don\\u2019t get separated. Don\\u2019t go off onto any areas without telling me.\\u201d We pop up successfully and I see the rest of the people that we\\u2019re supposed to be with and we rush and we connect back with them. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember exactly what they said, but they\\u2019re telling us what happened during their wormhole experience. The interesting thing about this as the dream is starting to come to a close is that together we find the next wormhole that we\\u2019re supposed to dive into, but people keep needing to go to the washroom. But I\\u2019m telling them they can\\u2019t do this because each washroom is a wormhole and we\\u2019re supposed to stay together. Some of them decide to do it anyway and I know that here we go again, we\\u2019re going to get sidetracked from our purpose. Well, we keep trying to find each other. And then I see this old man again and he\\u2019s standing up - he\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am. Now as I start talking to him I\\u2019m not just seeing him for what his profession is with small talk, but I start to feel beyond the surface of his skin into the character and kind of being he is, and he\\u2019s just so beautiful on the inside. My being feels his being. I tell him that once I go down into the wormhole, I won\\u2019t ever see him again. And he says, \\u201cyes, I know.\\u201d And then we just start to hug, but it\\u2019s the kind of hug where you just kind of fall into the other person - it\\u2019s not a squeezy hug, it\\u2019s just so enveloping and I just stand there. It seems like five minutes go by and I\\u2019m so comforted by this hug. And I realize as we\\u2019re doing this that we also need to not get so preoccupied with staying on the grid, that we\\u2019re missing the connections with the people that are in between wormholes. And then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cake\\u201d I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I tell him that sure, I\\u2019ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn\\u2019t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it\\u2019s run by a temperamental chef. There\\u2019s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I\\u2019m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they\\u2019re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they\\u2019re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they\\u2019re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I\\u2019m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I\\u2019m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there\\u2019s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there\\u2019s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover\\u2019s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She\\u2019s about 10. And she\\u2019s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn\\u2019t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she\\u2019s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn\\u2019t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn\\u2019t upset about it. He\\u2019s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he\\u2019s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn\\u2019t address the cake. Now we\\u2019re in a car and we\\u2019re driving up this beautiful roadway - it\\u2019s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there\\u2019s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in when you\\u2019re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It\\u2019s a perfect day and there\\u2019s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it\\u2019s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cPhotographs\\u201d The setting is somewhere I\\u2019ve never been before. I don\\u2019t recognize it. The population is a higher density than I\\u2019ve lived anywhere in Canada. I\\u2019ve never lived anywhere else other than here, so I'm not sure. The architecture I\\u2019m positive is much older than contemporary. It\\u2019s not made of stone though, so it\\u2019s not Medieval, it\\u2019s not Renaissance. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Northern European either. I\\u2019m feeling it\\u2019s more Mediterranean or something closer to the Equator, though it\\u2019s not as hot climate wise. It\\u2019s very colorful. There\\u2019s a lot of curves to the architecture and extra pieces added on, too, and it\\u2019s not just a box structure. There\\u2019s artistic pieces added on so it looks pleasing to the eye. It\\u2019s very artsy in this community. People make everything by hand. There\\u2019s a lot of thought put into it first. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be hierarchy of economy either or social standing. So what you eat, what you wear and your craft are all socially equal. So when you go to have food, you pick each item from the person who has created it. Then you create your food together. You can also go to a cook who is making food for others. You don\\u2019t just go in there, order at a counter and buy it. You have a conversation and then the cook shares a dish with you that he/she/they think you would like. So it\\u2019s quite different and very beautiful. I am a representative of life. In my dream I\\u2019m not called a photographer. I don\\u2019t actually have a camera. I have something that takes shadows so it\\u2019s a light. There\\u2019s a background and then once the light is shined on the object or person, it\\u2019s the outline that represents who they are. I make these for people. So they\\u2019ll come in and have a conversation with me and when I think it\\u2019s time, I\\u2019ll shine the light (with their permission, that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re there for, it\\u2019s not uninvited) and create a shadow for them. Lots of times this is done in exchange for foods or other gifts. This is a barter system economy. I\\u2019m very happy there. The dream comes to a conclusion in two ways. There seems to be a theme in my dreams lately where they\\u2019re both/and. Things are happening at the same time. So at the same time as I am creating a shadow piece for myself, I am also in the place where the person who cooks for other people is cooking. I\\u2019m in there just sitting. I\\u2019m actually studying some of my own work. The cook is androgynous. That seems to be another theme. I\\u2019m talking to them just in little bits. It\\u2019s a very comfortable conversation - the way you would have a conversation with someone you lived with for a long period of time where you say a couple of sentences and they respond and you\\u2019re both kind of doing your own thing. Fifteen minutes go by and then you make another couple remarks. It\\u2019s like that. So I\\u2019m in there and I\\u2019m aware that there\\u2019s a man that comes in. He\\u2019s trying to order a sandwich the way we would here now. The cook is not responding to him. So I\\u2019m aware that this exchange is unsuccessfully occuring in the sidelines of my consciousness. It gets to a point where I\\u2019m uncomfortable continuing to do what I\\u2019m doing there because this is disruptive. I\\u2019m aware that the cook is agitated. I\\u2019m aware also that the man is not going to go away. I feel compassion and want to stand in to alleviate the discomfort. So I go behind where the food is prepared. I start talking to the cook in the way I would talk to the cook before I was offered something to eat, hoping that by modeling the behavior, the man is going to understand. He doesn\\u2019t. Instead he thinks that I\\u2019m another employee. He starts trying to get me to make the sandwich. I don\\u2019t. But the cook responds to me and gives me a couple slices of tomato. So I go get a plate and put the tomato slices on a plate and bring it over to where I had been doing my own work. He looks puzzled at first and then a little bit angry. I assume that he\\u2019s been thinking, \\u201cWow, I\\u2019ve been standing here asking for something for x number of minutes, and she just walks in there and starts helping herself and gets service.\\u201d And then he reaches over as though he\\u2019s going to help himself, and then someone else materializes on the scene and grabs his arm and removes it. There\\u2019s a commotion. The man is eventually removed because he won\\u2019t listen and he won\\u2019t start trying to force a sandwich because none is appearing. I realize that I\\u2019m describing this, my consciousness is flipping back and forth from this scene through the portal of my work that I\\u2019m trying to focus on. In my own work, I am adjusting my own posture so I can get the line of the shadow that I want through this piece. The piece is created by wearing a sarong just between your navel and your hips. It\\u2019s not a flowy sarong, it\\u2019s more like the ones you see in Egyptian photos where the material is thicker and the piece that hangs over the front is wide - it\\u2019s not flowy, it\\u2019s made of a stiffer fabric. On the top fabric goes around the ribcage up to the nipples, so they start at the bottom rib - the material is stiffer - and they go up towards the nipples. What keeps happening is every time I adjust this piece of fabric over my own body, it goes over top of my nipples and I\\u2019m trying to get it to say just below the line of the nipples so you see the actual line of the nipples in the outline and then it goes down the rest of the body. Also in my dream, my physical body is getting really turned on by this. Every time it happens in my dream, I find it hard to stay in the dream. So the moment I get this right. There it is! The shadow is exactly the way I want it to look and feel, it\\u2019s just like Boom! My whole body is electrified. That\\u2019s the end of the dream. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cash\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town and I\\u2019m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They\\u2019re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I\\u2019m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it\\u2019s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there\\u2019s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they\\u2019re not making any sound, so I\\u2019m suspecting that it\\u2019s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don\\u2019t have that much money yet. I\\u2019m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don\\u2019t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I\\u2019m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I\\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table. They\\u2019ve wandered off now and I\\u2019m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I\\u2019m sensing another presence there that I can\\u2019t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what\\u2019s wrong with my car. He\\u2019s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic\\u2019s and I tell them exactly what\\u2019s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don\\u2019t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I\\u2019ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, \\u201cYay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.\\u201d And they\\u2019re saying, \\u201cOh wow, that\\u2019s fantastic.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn\\u2019t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.\\u201d So I\\u2019m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I\\u2019m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar\\u2019s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he\\u2019s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I\\u2019ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, \\u201cOh, what was wrong with it?\\u201d And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I\\u2019m cautious as Mike asks me what\\u2019s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, \\u201cOh? How did you know to say that?\\u201d because he knows even though I\\u2019m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don\\u2019t know the exact language to call the parts. And he\\u2019s looking at me. And I\\u2019m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I\\u2019m thinking is that I don\\u2019t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he\\u2019s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we\\u2019re in shifts and changes and we\\u2019re sitting in his mom\\u2019s actual house on the couch in the living room. There\\u2019s a picture of Omar on the end table. I\\u2019ve got my one arm around the back of Mike\\u2019s shoulders soothing him. I\\u2019m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, \\u201cOmar told you, didn\\u2019t he?\\u201d and I said, \\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d And then I say to him: \\u201care you okay?\\u201d And he puts his head down and it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom\\u2019s house are gone. We\\u2019re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we\\u2019re in it. Omar\\u2019s at the wheel and he\\u2019s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He\\u2019s tapping the gas pedal and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201chmm well this is good.\\u201d I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, \\u201cyeah and look how much cash I\\u2019ve got left over.\\u201d He laughs. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that extra cash?\\u201d And I know what I\\u2019m going to do with it, but I haven\\u2019t told anyone. So we\\u2019re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it\\u2019s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we\\u2019re driving down Colburn for a block and now it\\u2019s the year it would be now. I\\u2019m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an ice cream store over there. That\\u2019s new. There\\u2019s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there\\u2019s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn\\u2019t changed.\\u201d Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing? Now we\\u2019re back on Kent St.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.\\u201d He looks at me and we\\u2019re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I\\u2019ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing here?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I\\u2019ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.\\u201d I give it to him and I say, \\u201cGo buy a guitar. Just do it!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d So we go into the store and we\\u2019re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, \\u201cOh what one are you interested in?\\u201d Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, \\u201cWell, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn\\u2019t have the pickup and it\\u2019s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.\\u201d So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.\\u201d (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYes!\\u201d And he says, \\u201cDone!\\u201d So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they\\u2019re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that\\u2019s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there\\u2019s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There\\u2019s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There\\u2019s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it\\u2019s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he\\u2019s doing. It looks like he\\u2019s making chocolate chip cookies. He\\u2019s got the dough rolled out and there\\u2019s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, \\u201cWhat the hell?!\\u201d I walk up and I\\u2019m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they\\u2019re not even chocolate chips. They\\u2019re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I\\u2019m thinking, oh my god, that\\u2019s gross, but I\\u2019m fascinated that he\\u2019s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: \\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\\u201d and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they\\u2019ve already gone out of that room and I know they\\u2019re going down a hall and there\\u2019s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There\\u2019s no tools in front of him and no table. He\\u2019s faking working. I realize that he\\u2019s eavesdropping, he\\u2019s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my dream?! You\\u2019ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.\\u201d He starts telling me that he\\u2019s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It\\u2019s bullshit what he\\u2019s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don\\u2019t want to lose them and I certainly don\\u2019t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it\\u2019s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He\\u2019s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like \\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, \\u201cThis is Errant, my ex-husband.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cThis is Omar.\\u201d As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar\\u2019s hand, I realize that there\\u2019s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant\\u2019s going to be mad about this and he\\u2019s going to pound it out into me because he\\u2019s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I\\u2019m like I can\\u2019t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don\\u2019t want that handshake to join. Errant says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad,\\u201d as though he knows Omar\\u2019s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, \\u201cFor fucks sake! He knows that and he\\u2019s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He\\u2019s inserting himself here and of course, Omar\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh thanks very much.\\u201d He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, \\u201cOh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.\\u201d I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I\\u2019m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there\\u2019s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I\\u2019m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he\\u2019s a jerk, don\\u2019t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I\\u2019m still so agitated I can\\u2019t calm myself down in the dream. I\\u2019m feeling both threatened that Errant\\u2019s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I\\u2019m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I\\u2019m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won\\u2019t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I\\u2019m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.\"],[\"\\u201cTea\\u201d I was in a greenhouse. I was planting and growing things that I would eat. There\\u2019s other people there doing the same thing, but they\\u2019re \\u201cgreenhouse mates\\u201d - we\\u2019re not friends, they\\u2019re just there and we\\u2019re part of the greenhouse community. I occasionally speak to them. I ask them if they\\u2019ve ever tried growing this. One of them will comment that yes they have with success, or no they haven\\u2019t ever tried that, or they tried it without success. I\\u2019m growing an amazingly different number of lettuces and cabbages which look distinctly different from each other. I\\u2019ve never seen any other than two strains of cabbage in my waking life. But there\\u2019s all kinds of cabbage, some of it is beyond frilly to the point of being downright hairy, but they\\u2019re not hairs, they\\u2019re actually long and skinny cabbage fibers that grow from the head of the cabbage and you would cut off and eat. This appears to be one of my favorite ones because I\\u2019m growing a lot of it. In waking life I don\\u2019t eat wheat or gluten. So I\\u2019m growing this gluten free bread. You put the seeds in a bowl and it rises and turns into a bread, but it\\u2019s really made of vegetable fibers. So in the dream, there\\u2019s lots of me growing food and it\\u2019s a nice dream. Inside the greenhouse there\\u2019s the right amount of moisture. It\\u2019s a bit messy, but it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s hydroponics and actual seeds and dirt. Then as I begin to harvest some of the seeds I\\u2019ve been growing and put them in containers and compartments, the dream deconstructs into a townhouse that I actually used to live in, in a place called Wellington Square. I\\u2019m making tea. So I\\u2019m making it out of the things I\\u2019ve grown. I\\u2019m making apple tea out of apple leaves and actual apples. I pour it into the pot and the water is just the right temperature. I wait and let it steep. I remember it tasted really good, too. There was cinnamon in it. Then I decide to get out my grandmother\\u2019s fine china tea sets. I pour from the pot into the tea cups and sit for a minute and think, \\u201cWhy haven\\u2019t I used these before? Tea really does taste better in it.\\u201d I\\u2019m sitting sipping my tea and I realize that it was my uncle\\u2019s birthday the next day and I invite him. This is the end of January in my dream. My logical mind says to me, this isn\\u2019t his actual birthday because it\\u2019s not. I\\u2019ve never had a dream where my uncle was in it. He\\u2019s my biological mother\\u2019s brother. He\\u2019s not mean or anything, but he\\u2019s not a super nice person. He\\u2019s childish and selfish like she is, but I decide to invite him over for his birthday and I make this cake out of my gluten free flour that I\\u2019ve grown in the greenhouse. I ice it and make the apple tea. It\\u2019s ready in the pot with my grandmother\\u2019s tea cups. When he comes to the door, he\\u2019s got these two other people with him - they\\u2019re both male - he hasn\\u2019t asked if he could invite them, he\\u2019s never been to my house before, we aren\\u2019t that close and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve got a lot of nerve just showing up with two extra people.\\u201d However, I give them tea and cake and invite them to sit down. They eat their cake. They comment that it\\u2019s good, but what\\u2019s it made of, we\\u2019ve never had cake like this before. So I tell them that it\\u2019s gluten free and from the greenhouse. Then they comment on the tea in the teacups and say they would rather have it out of a mug. And they drink their tea and ask me to make more but they want it in a mug. So I collect their teacups from them and I say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s time for you to go.\\u201d So they leave with me coaxing them: \\u201cTime to go. Out you go. Here\\u2019s your coat. Here\\u2019s your boots.\\u201d I open the door. They\\u2019re kind of looking at me oddly, but they leave and I close the door behind them. And that\\u2019s it. Then there\\u2019s another person in my house. I invited her and it\\u2019s Janet and her boyfriend. Her phone starts ringing and she ignores it because she\\u2019s in my living room having tea and talking. So I put it in her purse and close the zipper because now there\\u2019s dirty dishes and teacups lying around and I don\\u2019t want anything to spill on her phone. Everybody else finishes their tea. My Uncle comes into the kitchen and he starts talking to me. He tells me that he\\u2019s not happy with the business that he has and since he\\u2019s only in his late fifties that he\\u2019s going to explore other options for a career. One of the things that he\\u2019d like to do is to work in a greenhouse. I\\u2019m thinking, well that\\u2019s interesting. I say to him, \\u201cAre you serious? You\\u2019re only in your late fifties.\\u201d I\\u2019m in a bit of a shock that he\\u2019s saying this to me because I know it\\u2019s a lie - I know that he\\u2019s a lot older than that and I think, \\u201cYou know, you\\u2019ve never shown any interest in greenhouses. Why are you telling me this?\\u201d So I\\u2019m suspicious of his conversation, though I\\u2019m also appreciative that he\\u2019s choosing to do something he would enjoy instead of something that he doesn\\u2019t like. And then he tells me that he\\u2019ll see me next year at the same time on his birthday. And I say, \\u201cYup, just like every other year when I\\u2019ve always made you something.\\u201d He looks at me with surprise as though he doesn\\u2019t remember that I have every year invited him over and made him a cake and offered him tea. Then he does leave. Janet and her boyfriend come into the kitchen. She notices that her phone is not where she left it. I tell her I put it in her purse. They leave and then I wash all the dishes and put away my grandmother\\u2019s teacups. I\\u2019m thinking of them fondly and put them back in the cupboard.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Trek\\u201d The setting is in a way that it\\u2019s not the orderly kind of linear almost based on Roman architecture grid for cities that we have now - it\\u2019s not like that, it\\u2019s much different. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Agrarian either. I get the feeling that it\\u2019s again post-apocalyptic, but much further along in the future than the dream when I was standing in a burnt world and started choking and woke up because I was choking. Everyone here, we are wearing ragged bits of eclectic pieces of clothing. There\\u2019s no real recognizable city structure. There\\u2019s ruined buildings with grass and vegetation growing up, in, around the building. People have settled there and built structures out of other scraps and things. It\\u2019s not unpleasant to look at. It has a settled, organized, civilized feel to it. However, there\\u2019s agrimony between groups of people who have settled around these places. Part of the group that I am settling with, we know we have to flee or we\\u2019re probably going to be killed. So we organize very quickly. We can\\u2019t bring all of our stuff. Our stuff is an eclectic variety of things that we use to feed ourselves and clothe ourselves with. Some people have backpacks and these are being dispersed among the group. I\\u2019d say there\\u2019s probably about 60 or 75 in my group, but for the purpose of traveling and feeding ourselves, we organize ourselves into four groups, so there\\u2019s about twelve to fifteen in each group. They are dividing people into groups by skill level, so if you have already shown some survival skill behavior, they don\\u2019t put all of those people in one group. They\\u2019re separating them so there\\u2019s at least one person who\\u2019s got some know-how in each group. I\\u2019m one of those people who has some survival skills. I\\u2019m separated from some of my closer friends because we can\\u2019t all travel together and this makes me sad. We also have people in the group who have babies. There\\u2019s one woman who\\u2019s carrying a baby. They also divide these people up because they drag people down. They can\\u2019t hunt and some of them don\\u2019t have survival skills - they feel more dependent. We also have got two toddlers in our group and they\\u2019re not even clothed. They\\u2019re running around naked and we\\u2019re trying to find small backpacks they can carry and some clothes that will fit them. They were dividing toddlers up and they\\u2019re not even with their parents - I have a feeling that they don\\u2019t have parents. They are just random toddlers, so they\\u2019re divided up into groups. So we leave separately. All this organizing and scavenging for equipment that we can carry on our backs is done before nightfall. We leave undercover of the dark. We know we cannot follow each other when we\\u2019re traveling in all these different groups because that will reduce the chances that we\\u2019ll survive. We need to be in smaller groups, so we won\\u2019t be spotted. Much of the dream is climbing over landscapes - meadows and cliffs and forests and swampy muddy things where we get completely filthy, but then find a body of water to wash in. There\\u2019s some skirmishes within the group where people are hungry and stealing each other\\u2019s food, including the toddlers. I have to take extra food away from kids - you know how kids will just randomly run around and graze, they\\u2019ll just shove food in their mouths as they\\u2019re going - I can\\u2019t let them do that. I have to keep them on the rations. So this is one dream memory of me opening up the toddlers hands and opening them up because they\\u2019ve got three times more of the berries than they\\u2019re supposed to have and I have to disperse these around. Part of me, as I\\u2019m doing this, feels regret because the child is so innocent - it\\u2019s a natural thing for a child to do and I feel a little sadness. I also feel a little bit of inner frustration that I even have a toddler that I have to do this with when we\\u2019re trying so hard to survive. So it\\u2019s an honest mixture of feelings that I have when I\\u2019m doing this. As we climb over more complicated and go through more dense flora and fauna, there\\u2019s a part where I\\u2019m aware that the group that is pursuing us and trying to kill us is actually on our trail. I realize they\\u2019re getting closer. I see this because I\\u2019ve climbed up high. There's an alarm in the middle of the night. I have to wake everybody up and get them to move. Some of them don\\u2019t want to and I\\u2019m like, pack your backpack! And some people don\\u2019t want to carry it, and I\\u2019m like if you don\\u2019t get up and move we\\u2019re going to have to leave you here! So I end up carrying three more packs than I\\u2019m supposed to. I end up getting everybody up, but there\\u2019s a couple of people that were groggy and wouldn\\u2019t wake up, they may be with the group, but I\\u2019m not sure and we have to move. Then we are in like the Amazon forest and we rappel up. We make it all the way up. It\\u2019s hard. We\\u2019re carrying toddlers in packs, passing things out, and we make it up to the top. We are safe now from that group. The landscape is still pretty densely forested. As we realize we\\u2019re safe, we\\u2019re able to spread out and rest a little bit. It was pretty onerous getting up there like that and so has the whole journey. So we take a couple days to rest. As I\\u2019m doing this and we\\u2019re setting up a makeshift camp, I realize that one of the other groups is close by and doing a similar thing. I sneak through the underbrush and I was about to make contact and ask the leader if they think it\\u2019s safe to join up just for the rest part, I see that my ex best friend is in that group, and now I don\\u2019t want to. I don\\u2019t want to have any communication with her. I\\u2019m glad she\\u2019s out of my life. She\\u2019s really hurt me and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re no longer friends. I don\\u2019t want her back in. She\\u2019s also narcissistic and I feel much better now that she\\u2019s out of my life. But there\\u2019s also some sadness with it too - when someone you love and care about betrays you, there\\u2019s also some sadness. So I feel this emotion going through my body. By this time, the other leader is aware of our group. Some of the members of their group have spread out far enough so everyone knows that we\\u2019re both here. So I end up having to suck it up as we get together with this other group for a meal. There\\u2019s people in that group who were friends of mine from before we had to leave our home, so I\\u2019m having this pleasant conversation with them. It\\u2019s a feeling of camaraderie. I\\u2019m aware that my friend knows I\\u2019m there. I also feel this thread of self satisfaction that she\\u2019s not one of the organizers - she didn\\u2019t have survival skills. Her skills were based on what she could suck off of others, so she\\u2019s demoted into that part of the social fabric of her group and I will truthfully admit to feeling a smack of satisfaction over that. The dream ends with us folding up our camps and putting them all back in our backpacks. You wouldn\\u2019t even know we were there. We\\u2019re brushing any vegetation that has been flattened with sticks with leaves on them and we continue on our trek.\"],[\"\\u201cShady Contracts\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room full of people involved in conversations with each other. I\\u2019m sitting with a group of friends having a pleasant conversation when someone taps on my shoulder and says, \\u201cThat woman over there would like to speak with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little annoyed that I\\u2019m being interrupted during something social to do something that feels like work. I look over that it\\u2019s Claire, a studio owner of someone I used to work with but I\\u2019ve parted ways due to her unethical practices. I refuse to go over there and just tell the messenger that I\\u2019m busy. I continue talking with my friends, but he\\u2019s persistent. He won\\u2019t leave me alone. He stalks me everywhere. So I finally go over there just to tell her to piss off. There\\u2019s a pile of documents on the table and I see they\\u2019re spread out a bit. I see sticking out from one of them, my name. So now I\\u2019m sucked into engaging with them because I want to know why my name is on a piece of paper. They should not have anything to do with me - we never signed a contract, though I always wanted to. So there\\u2019s nothing that has my signature on it. He sees me glance at it and my arm is reaching to pull it out from the bottom. He swipes it first. He is her representative - at some point he\\u2019s told me this or I\\u2019ve just assumed it from the conversation, but he\\u2019s definitely behaving like it now. So I say, \\u201cWhat is that with my name on it?\\u201d He says it\\u2019s a contract. I say it can\\u2019t be because I\\u2019ve never signed anything with Claire here or her studio. He says, \\u201cIt says here that you release her from any responsibility for any shady interactions or any responsibility for her past actions. \\u201c I\\u2019m a little bit outraged and refuse. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m not signing anything like that. It\\u2019s a lie!\\u201d I also don\\u2019t think that she should escape accountability for her actions. At this point she speaks and says she\\u2019s applying for a new business and she needs all her past employees to sign this contract in order for her to have a pristine business record and move forward to something else. I still refuse to sign it because it\\u2019s dishonest. I want the piece of paper and I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking this with me.\\u201d The representative says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take that with you. It\\u2019s a legal piece of paper that doesn\\u2019t belong to you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes I can because it has my name on it.\\u201d Then Claire says, \\u201cYou can take it with you.\\u201d She reaches out to shake my hand and I realize that there\\u2019s a bulky piece of folded up paper in it and something that feels cold, like ceramic. So I look down in my hand and examine the ceramic thing. The closest I can describe it is those ceramic things in old lady\\u2019s bathrooms that you put the end of the toothpaste in and start to roll from the bottom up so that it squeezes all the toothpaste out. It looks like that, but is twice as wide, probably 6 inches wide. There\\u2019s a small chain attached to it. At the end is a tiny hook that looks somewhat like a paperclip that\\u2019s been partially unfolded. I\\u2019m thinking, what the heck is this? It\\u2019s glazed in white with blue and has my name on it. Is this something to mount a piece of paper on? There\\u2019s a hook and chain on it. So I\\u2019m puzzling over this. Then I open up the eight-times folded piece of paper and see that it\\u2019s a check for $201 from her to me. I realize that she\\u2019s trying to pay me for my silence. I still refuse to sign it but I walk away with the check and this bound thing that would bind me to her forever symbolically. Although I didn\\u2019t get the piece of paper with my name on it - I didn\\u2019t sign it. I walk away and I\\u2019m feeling like I don\\u2019t even want this check or this ceramic thing. So I turn around and she\\u2019s still at the table, but I\\u2019m walking towards them and all the footsteps I take aren\\u2019t bringing me closer to the table. I can still see her and I\\u2019m not any closer. This is really frustrating me. Then the scene morphs into I\\u2019m trying to walk through this row of beds, like you\\u2019d see in a television orphanage (I\\u2019ve never actually been in an orphanage). There\\u2019s a bunch of single beds lined up and they all have people in them and all their belongings with them, like homeless people. I have to step over all of them because mine\\u2019s at the very end. It has a change of clothing with a hairbrush, toothpaste, some snack-like foods that come already pre-packaged, like cookies in a bag. There\\u2019s a television there as well. Everyone has their own television and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I guess this is where I have to sleep for now.\\u201d I\\u2019m angry that I have to step over all these people. I\\u2019m angry that someone is partially lying on my own bed. Just as I lie down in it to get comfortable, these two teenagers come up and say that it\\u2019s their turn to have the bed now. They have this piece of paper to prove it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t even notice that was on the piece of paper and now I don\\u2019t have anywhere to sleep and I\\u2019m mad and I\\u2019m swearing and I\\u2019m yelling and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cFine, but you can\\u2019t have it until all my stuff\\u2019s gone. Get out, stand back there and I\\u2019ll tell you when I\\u2019m ready.\\u201d I start taking my sheets and blankets off my bed, and I\\u2019m taking all the little things and putting them in my backpack. I do that, step over all the people and leave really angry. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Explosion\\u201d I\\u2019m in a garage and it\\u2019s open. It\\u2019s set up like a garage sale - the garage is open, there\\u2019s all kinds of stuff, tables going down the driveway and all kinds of eclectic assortment of things for sale. Then there\\u2019s some other bigger things like bicycles and whatnot and some furniture and other freestanding items. It\\u2019s dense with material items as well as a traffic of people going back and forth. This is not my house. This is my friend\\u2019s house. He\\u2019s currently playing his old drum set at the back of the garage. He\\u2019s facing out so he can see who comes and goes and be of assistance if someone asks a question. I\\u2019m just hanging out there chatting casually with him. One of the women that comes up is an attractive brunette and she\\u2019s wearing a mini skirt. I notice that her body is very svelte like she works out and I notice this and think, wow she\\u2019s really attractive. She starts asking my friend about some item that she\\u2019s interested in. As he is answering her, she turns around so her back is to him, and she bends over to pick something up. Then this explosion comes out of her butt and the whole garage is sprayed with shit! It\\u2019s all over everything. I\\u2019m incredulous. I\\u2019m astonished that she\\u2019s done this and she just stands up and acts like nothing\\u2019s happened. She doesn\\u2019t apologize and she just walks away. My friend has got some of this on him and instead of cleaning himself up, he goes over and starts wiping up the stuff that is on the floor around the yard sale items without seeming to notice that he\\u2019s got some of it on him and he needs to go wash his face. I\\u2019m just really disgusted. For some reason I\\u2019m mute. I\\u2019m not saying anything, but I\\u2019m in horror. Then the dream shifts from that scene. I\\u2019m in another friend\\u2019s house. She\\u2019s a person I know in real life, she\\u2019s a substitute mom to me. I\\u2019m in her house and I\\u2019m upstairs. I\\u2019m helping sort something out. It goes from that scene of sorting to a restaurant I worked at while in University.\"],[\"\\u201cBoundaries and Brats\\u201d This dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019ve had lots of dreams set in this house. It\\u2019s long and narrow, although the rooms are plenty big enough - they\\u2019re just longer than they are wide. There're houses in New Orleans called shotgun houses because they\\u2019re long like that and the entrance to all the rooms are off the hallway, so if you\\u2019re driving by and shooting a gun, you could shoot a bullet in the front door and it goes all the way through the house and out the backdoor. So I guess it\\u2019s a shotgun house. We\\u2019re in the very back room of this house, which is my bedroom. We\\u2019re having a house discussion, so all the people that live there are having a conversation about pets. We have lots and I love pets. But one of them has a cow and I don\\u2019t want it lying on my bed because it runs around outside and in the backyard, too, where there\\u2019s poops lying around on the grass, so it\\u2019s got poops on its feet or it could have at any given time. I don\\u2019t want that on my bed. So I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cAnimals, if they can be trained to stay on the floor, then that\\u2019s fine, they\\u2019re allowed in my room. But if they\\u2019re up on my bed, then I won\\u2019t also allow them in my room.\\u201d The cow is in the room while we\\u2019re saying this. As I\\u2019m talking, it\\u2019s doing this sad eyes and pouty mouth. First it puts its head in my lap and looks sad, then it rolls a little bit at a time, like a toddler does when they\\u2019re limp and you\\u2019re trying to get them to walk and they just turn into a blob. It\\u2019s doing this. Then it\\u2019s on the bed. So I push it off and it\\u2019s heavy - it\\u2019s got a great big belly and it\\u2019s bigger than I am and it\\u2019s head is the size of my torso. But I push it back onto the floor and it looks at me mournfully. But I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, get off my bed.\\u201d But the people I\\u2019m having this discussion with don\\u2019t even hear me. And they say, \\u201cOkay, so it\\u2019s alright if the cow is on your bed as long as your bed is made and the quilt is on.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo! I just finished saying, not on my bed under any circumstances!\\u201d Then the dream instantaneously is full of people and one of the roommates is having a birthday party for an 8-10 year old kid. So it feels like there\\u2019s hundreds of these kids around and they start opening my drawers and pulling out my shirts. One of them has a pair of scissors and they\\u2019re making costumes to dress up with. She starts to cut up one of my shirts and use the pieces of it for something else. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not allowed to do that, get out of my dresser. Close the drawer.\\u201d She looks at me and rolls her eyes like that 13 year old girl way - make a face. Then she leaves, but I see her looking back as she\\u2019s leaving and I intuit that she\\u2019s just waiting until I\\u2019m out of my room and she\\u2019s going to come back in anyway. So I put my clothes that they\\u2019ve taken out back in the dresser drawers. So there\\u2019s nothing on the floor and my room is back intact again. I close the door. I go through this crowd of kids to look for the roommate who is responsible for them. This person has no defining features, I can\\u2019t tell if they\\u2019re a man or woman, they\\u2019re just a roommate. I say to the roommate, \\u201cYou need to tell these kids that they\\u2019re not allowed in my room.\\u201d They\\u2019re like a phantom. I don\\u2019t really get a response from them and I realize it\\u2019s my responsibility to keep these kids out of my room. So I turn around and I see my bedroom door is open. So I go back in. This time I\\u2019m angry and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI told you guys not to do this and you\\u2019re doing it anyway! I\\u2019m taking your scissors and all this stuff you\\u2019ve made because you\\u2019re not respecting this!\\u201d I kick them out of my room again with these angry words and push them out with my hands. I can feel my hands making contact with them. Now they\\u2019re giving me the angry teenager rolling eyes angry look. So they\\u2019re looking back at me and I\\u2019m standing there like grrrr. I look down the hallway and the roommate is now aware of my displeasure and decides to take them to a movie instead. But it\\u2019s communicated to me that it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re respecting my boundaries or making the kids aware that there are boundaries they need to follow, but that \\u201cOh well Freya is grumpy and terrible so we\\u2019re just going to go somewhere else.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cCommunity\\u201d There\\u2019s a lot of mundane stuff that I won\\u2019t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they\\u2019re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she\\u2019s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re not triggered that you see her.\\u201d And my non-dream psyche answers back, \\u201cNo, hmm, I\\u2019m not.\\u201d But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we\\u2019re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it\\u2019s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We\\u2019re having casual conversations. It\\u2019s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There\\u2019s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He\\u2019s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he\\u2019s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he\\u2019s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it\\u2019s odd. I realize as I\\u2019m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn\\u2019t stand living there - one of the things I\\u2019ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that\\u2019s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there\\u2019s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he\\u2019s gathered all these people together. We\\u2019ve all brought our own food. He\\u2019s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who\\u2019s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property\\u2019s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it\\u2019s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it\\u2019s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. \\u201cOh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!\\u201d \\u201cI can store my snowmobile here!\\u201d \\u201cI can put my motorcycle here!\\u201d \\u201cOh here\\u2019s a big place I can take my dog out to run!\\u201d So it\\u2019s this whole building of community and that\\u2019s what the dream was about.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Wall\\u201d The second dream, I\\u2019m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I\\u2019m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they\\u2019ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won\\u2019t be aware of what they\\u2019ve actually been doing. I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they\\u2019re hiding, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you even hiding that? It\\u2019s just a book.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I\\u2019m still a teenager in it, though, and I\\u2019ve moved out of their house but I\\u2019ve gone back for a visit. There\\u2019s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there\\u2019s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I\\u2019m looking at what she\\u2019s brought out. I see a couple things and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! That was mine! I don\\u2019t remember hiding that and I didn\\u2019t even notice I was missing it.\\u201d So in the dream, we\\u2019re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don\\u2019t know what to do with mine. I guess I don\\u2019t have any pockets. I can\\u2019t seem to think in the dream, \\u201cOh why don\\u2019t I just take them with me?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m encumbered with the idea that the mom can\\u2019t see it and I\\u2019ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, \\u201cMom, Freya\\u2019s been hiding things in the wall.\\u201d Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she\\u2019s really disappointed in me that I\\u2019ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I\\u2019m thinking I don\\u2019t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I\\u2019m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.\"],[\"\\u201cNo Voice\\u201d This time the setting is different. I\\u2019m in a mall and I\\u2019m teaching yoga. I\\u2019m not in a room so there\\u2019s just posts and no walls. It\\u2019s a designated area for my yoga class but there aren\\u2019t any walls. The mall is packed, there\\u2019s lots of shoppers. People are going about their own business. The people that have come in for yoga have intentionally come for the class. However, I\\u2019m unable to organize them. The time I\\u2019m supposed to start the class, they\\u2019re still talking to each other. It\\u2019s like they can\\u2019t hear me. It\\u2019s like trying to shepherd chickens. They\\u2019re running all over the place. I\\u2019m trying to get their attention and I\\u2019m trying to teach. As soon as I get them organized with their mats down, I say about six words and they\\u2019ll wander off again or start talking to each other or look at something from a window that\\u2019s in the mall. At one point, out of frustration, there\\u2019s a carny with a headset on. I walk over and say to them, \\u201cI notice you\\u2019re not using your headset right now. Is it okay if I borrow it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d So I put it on. He shows me how to use it and I walk back over. It works for about 6 seconds. Then the class is the same. Now 35 minutes have gone by and I haven\\u2019t even started my class. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Recital\\u201d This is a really long dream, so I\\u2019m going to summarize some of the parts. It opens up and I\\u2019m at a wedding dance - a wedding celebration where people are dancing. There\\u2019s log tables with people sitting at them and food. The point of this part of it is I\\u2019m surrounded by people I do not want to be surrounded by. I love dancing but i can\\u2019t find anybody I want to dance with. And the people at this wedding are people I don\\u2019t want to share a meal with, so it\\u2019s not very much fun. The scene immediately shifts and I\\u2019m in a farmhouse in a completely different era. I'm participating in making and preserving food. So various people are doing various things. There\\u2019s some people who are actually churning butter. There are people that are milking cows and bringing the milk in pails to the people that are churning the butter. I am aware that there\\u2019s a smokehouse and there\\u2019s people building the fires and curing and smoking meats. It's outside though. Both of these are outside - the smokehouse is further away. Of course the cows are further away than that. The churning butter is closer to the house and I\\u2019m actually in the farmhouse. I\\u2019m in the kitchen. I\\u2019ve been chopping and making what appears to be kimchi which is odd given the historical setting. I\\u2019m putting it all in mason jars and sealing them. I can still smell the aroma of boiling vinegar in my nose. When I finish this, I turn around and Omar is there again. He\\u2019s distanced from me again, so he doesn\\u2019t really know me. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s Omar\\u2019s body but not his spirit in it. He sort of doesn\\u2019t know who I am. He tells me that he\\u2019s been aging Scotch. He tells me what he did with it. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did it work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Then the time speeds up and all of a sudden it\\u2019s today\\u2019s time and I have the two kids that I have. I\\u2019m telling Omar that I have to leave to take my son to his dance lesson. I ask him if he wants to come. He says, no he can\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m disappointed, but I have to go. I leave to go out the farmhouse door. This other guy that used to be a neighborhood thief hops in the car - in the backseat - as I\\u2019m leaving. I end up driving him to Brantford where he gets out and takes off somewhere. So I\\u2019ve picked up both my kids. I\\u2019m taking them to the dance lesson. There\\u2019s been some fiddling around and delays. When I was trying to get in the car, I was trying to get this thief out of it, and I think I\\u2019ve barely made it in time. I think the lesson is an hour, but as it turns out, it\\u2019s only a half hour and as soon as we get there, it\\u2019s over. So I take my kids back into the car and my son\\u2019s dad is in the backseat. He gets out and checks the oil level in the trunk and he\\u2019s spilling it everywhere. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I didn\\u2019t even want you to do that because I\\u2019m in a hurry again. Now why is he here delaying me?\\u201d Then he disappears and I\\u2019m immediately back in the parking lot of hte dance lesson building again. Time just skipped to another day. So I\\u2019m taking my kids back in and we're on time this time. I walk them into the recital hall. My son is acting in it and my daughter is dancing. I\\u2019m sitting up really close to him and I realize that he\\u2019s got different makeup on and he\\u2019s got an elaborate costume. He\\u2019s acting like an old man. He\\u2019s supposed to be chauffeuring another person from the play. I\\u2019m astonished at what a good job he\\u2019s doing with the acting right down to the smallest movements of his body. The rehearsal is finished and both my kids are given parts, none of which they\\u2019ve auditioned for, but they\\u2019re lead roles and neither one of my kids are lead-role people. They accept them graciously. They\\u2019re supposed to walk up onto the stage - each kid has done this - stand there to wait to be bestowed some kind of role and then curtsy and bow and exit out the other side of the stage and come back to their seats. So they\\u2019ve done this. When they get to their seats, they say, \\u201cOh no, Mom, I didn\\u2019t want these and I don\\u2019t want to be the lead role\\u201d and blah blah blah. Then I tell them, \\u201cWell, you should say something.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cNobody ever complains. They just take the roles. We don\\u2019t want to be the first ones to complain.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, if you don't want to do it, speak up. Maybe you could just ask if you can speak to them separately.\\u201d So my daughter approaches the head dance role person and I can\\u2019t hear what they\\u2019re saying, but they\\u2019re speaking. A moment later this head person says that my kids have something to say. They\\u2019ve set up this thing - like a platform. They wheel it onto the stage. It's long and skinny, about 4 feet long and about a foot wide. It\\u2019s on wheels and it\\u2019s got a railing around it, only on three sides, though. So they enter it from the back where there\\u2019s no railing. They have to stand in this and the dance role person makes them announce what they have asked to say. So it almost feels like a humiliation, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a humiliation or an honoring as they\\u2019ve put them in this railing thing and wheeled them onto the stage. They say, \\u201dUm, we don\\u2019t want these roles. Thank you very much, but we graciously decline these roles.\\u201d Then the audience starts clapping. They don\\u2019t look upset, so I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cPhew, oh look at them. I\\u2019m glad that they have been true to themselves.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Rose Farm\\u201d This dream begins in the house where I grew up. I\\u2019m in the kitchen waiting for a phone call. Some man is in the basement and he\\u2019s making something and periodically he comes upstairs. He\\u2019s wearing a toolbelt, he has a saw and he grabs some nails that are in a box on top of the fridge and goes back down with them. So, each time he trucks up and down the stairs, I\\u2019m aware that he has not finished making what he\\u2019s making down there. There\\u2019s a special delivery that comes to the front door. I answer it and bring it back to the table to open. It\\u2019s a package that was sent by a woman named Maureen that composes aerobics classes for GoodLife Fitness in Canada. It says I\\u2019m sorry for your loss and open it up and it\\u2019s this choreography for an aerobics class. However, it\\u2019s just the musical score. There\\u2019s no direction of what to put with it. There\\u2019s another person in the kitchen now and she\\u2019s someone that teaches this class. I show her the score and say, \\u201cUm, this is a nice gesture but how useful is it without the steps? There\\u2019s no choreography. It's only the music.\\u201d She looks at it with me and says, \\u201cHmmm,\\u201d and starts to listen to it and see if she can put steps to it. She gives up and says, \\u201cthis is impossible.\\u201d She sits down and then I look at it again. I realize that the beat is in things you can do in 8 and if you take 5 steps to the front, 1 to the side, 1 to the back and go back to where you started it does equal 8. So I\\u2019m starting to try to figure this out and then the phone rings. It\\u2019s Maureen from Good Life and she\\u2019s in a peppy aerobics instructor voice, \\u201cHi, this is Maureen! Did you get my package?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, I did, but I\\u2019m not quite sure what to do with it seeing there\\u2019s no choreography.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh well, there\\u2019s a word for that.\\u201d And I reply back, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s Word!\\u201d as a rapper would say it. There\\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone and she\\u2019s somewhat offended. The conversation ends. I go back into the kitchen, fully prepared to keep trying to figure this out for myself when the carpenter has completed this small box. He gives it to me and says, \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d As soon as I take the box in my hand, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m on this old farm. The farm has a sign in front of it and it\\u2019s called The Rose Farm. There\\u2019s a pump so you can pump the water up out of the ground. Everything is made of granite, which is a rock, and it\\u2019s faded pink. It really breathes history. The farm is strangely quiet, it\\u2019s almost like a museum. There\\u2019s no real activity going on in it. I go inside the farmhouse and there\\u2019s an old woman sitting there. My cat is with me. I say to her, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought something to comfort you.\\u201d I set the box down on the table. She\\u2019s sad. She looks up. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought my cat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think mine only has about an hour left.\\u201d Rather than seeing where her cat is lying, I see it as a vision in front of my eyes and it\\u2019s kind of suspended between the ground and the ceiling. The cat looks old - it looks like a 25 year old cat. Its fur is matted and its skin is emaciated away from its bones. The joints are big and round like arthritic. My cat is a lot younger, it\\u2019s black. It comes with me into the kitchen and my cat sits down beside me. We both wait there with her. Then I look at the wooden box I\\u2019ve set on the table and then I realize that it\\u2019s a coffin for her cat and she says, \\u201cThank you, I\\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here.\\u201d She takes the coffin and goes into the room and doesn't come back - neither one of them. And then my cat and I sit in the kitchen. I\\u2019m patting my cat and then the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cLima\\u201d This dream starts as though I\\u2019m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There\\u2019s a function, so it\\u2019s quite crowded and there\\u2019s a lot of people, most of whom I don\\u2019t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There\\u2019s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there\\u2019s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it\\u2019s over and it\\u2019s been over for some time. He\\u2019s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I\\u2019m reading the letter, it\\u2019s two pages long and there\\u2019s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, \\u201cDid he say anything to you personally?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just news.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m reading it again. There\\u2019s a story about his cat named Lima. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, what\\u2019s happened to him?\\u201d because he has two of them and he\\u2019s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I\\u2019m reading that the cat is missing. He\\u2019s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that\\u2019s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he\\u2019s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I\\u2019m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what\\u2019s in the letter like he knows what\\u2019s in the letter and he\\u2019s going off about what\\u2019s in the letter. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what\\u2019s in here.\\u201d Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I\\u2019m over in the UK, which is a trip I\\u2019ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I\\u2019m over there. So now I\\u2019m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I\\u2019m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I\\u2019m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I\\u2019m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There\\u2019s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it\\u2019s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend\\u2019s flat and knock on the door. It\\u2019s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It\\u2019s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it\\u2019s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he\\u2019s asking me how my trip was. I\\u2019m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, \\u201cYes, one of my daughters is here.\\u201d Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.\\u201d That\\u2019s all he says. I know from that remark that she\\u2019s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she\\u2019s with some of her friends. They\\u2019re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she\\u2019s changed it to Grassy. I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.\\u201d She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, \\u201cIt was nice to see you.\\u201d I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I\\u2019m talking to my artist friend. I say, \\u201cOh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can\\u2019t keep up with it.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019ve each got some of you in them.\\u201d He kind of laughs and I ask him if he\\u2019s found his cat. He says, \\u201cNo, not yet.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, I saw the cat.\\u201d And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, \\u201cHmm, let\\u2019s just go check that out.\\u201d We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Concert\\u201d The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I\\u2019m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don\\u2019t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It\\u2019s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I\\u2019m waiting for my turn, there\\u2019s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It\\u2019s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it\\u2019s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don\\u2019t question this in the dream - it\\u2019s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I\\u2019m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I\\u2019m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I\\u2019m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I\\u2019m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven\\u2019t put them in the bank and they aren\\u2019t very safe where they are rolled up and put in this ceramic vase. So it sparks my memories. I put them back in the vase. It\\u2019s too late to go to the bank tonight, but I will go tomorrow. Then I go back downstairs. Omar and his friend Al and a girl he\\u2019s taking with him have arrived and they\\u2019re in the living room. We are happy to see each other. I go down and am talking to them for a while. I see what he\\u2019s wearing and tell him I\\u2019m going to get changed. I go back upstairs and someone is in the shower. I find a rolled up wad of money on the floor. I turn around and Omar is behind me. I say, \\u201cIs this yours?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Oh, there\\u2019s so many people in this house and we don\\u2019t know all of them. Don\\u2019t go downstairs and just say, \\u2018whose wad of money is this?\\u2019\\u201d I say, \\u201cI won\\u2019t. I\\u2019m going to go put it in my room and I\\u2019ll find a way to make it known to someone so they know their money is missing.\\u201d I go back into my room and I change. I pick out a black mini skirt with gold thread around the hem. I think it\\u2019s very pretty and sparkly. I choose a white blouse and a jacket that goes overtop just a few inches above the hem of the skirt. I put on my black tights and a pair of bulky socks and boots that look really nice. Then I go downstairs and Omar tells me I look very nice. But I turn and Al\\u2019s friend (I don\\u2019t know her name) is wearing the same thing I am. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s really odd. That wasn\\u2019t what she was wearing when I went up the stairs.\\u201d I look over at Omar and he\\u2019s laughing. I shrug it off and I say to everyone in the room, \\u201cHow much money is everyone bringing?\\u201d So I\\u2019m trying to get them to look in their wallets. The person whose money it is that\\u2019s missing will realize it\\u2019s lost and I can return the money to whoever it is. But they all check their wallets and they say different amounts. I say, \\u201cOkay, well I\\u2019m going to go upstairs and get my money.\\u201d While I\\u2019m going upstairs, the person is still in the shower and I realize it\\u2019s my nephew, Jared. I wonder if the money belongs to him. I put the wad of money in the same ceramic vase as the other checks that I need to deposit in the bank. Then I look through my own drawers and I find my wallet. I take out 2 twenties and put them in the little clutch that I\\u2019ve decided to take with me for the night. I go back downstairs again. Someone else is in the living room and she\\u2019s showing Omar this fabric and saying, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this beautiful? It would make a nice skirt.\\u201d I look and say, \\u201cOh yes, it is.\\u201d This is all gold and if you look closely, the gold thread has created patterns of flowers and it\\u2019s shimmering. This gold is really quite beautiful. Then suddenly, it\\u2019s not fabric anymore. It is a skirt - a longer skirt. She says, \\u201cThis skirt costs $2,000 and people pay that for it and only wear it once. Within a couple of weeks it\\u2019s in a punk rock thrift store and that\\u2019s where I found it. This would look really nice on you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWow, you\\u2019re giving it to me?!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThank you so much!\\u201d I was thinking maybe I\\u2019ll change into it for tonight and then decide not to because it\\u2019s a long skirt and I want to save it for another time. I ask her if she would like some money for it. She hesitates and doesn\\u2019t answer and I\\u2019m thinking I could give her another twenty. I\\u2019m waiting and waiting, but she doesn\\u2019t answer me, so I thank her graciously. I go back upstairs and I put it in my room. I look into my wallet and I get out another $20 just in case to give to her. So I go back downstairs and by this time, I\\u2019m becoming conscious that it feels like it's the same time and all these activities are happening and we still haven\\u2019t left for the concert. So I say to everyone, \\u201cShouldn\\u2019t we be leaving?\\u201d They say, \\u201cYes, it starts really soon.\\u201d I look out the door and I see that someone else is coming in and they need to get ready for the concert. Right at that time, there\\u2019s a sliver in the time-space continuum and I\\u2019m at work. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to get back to meet everyone for the concert.\\u201d Then when I'm thinking that, that same time frame fabric opens up and I\\u2019m back in the house. I think, \\u201cOh good, everyone is still here.\\u201d But then we\\u2019re waiting for someone else to get ready. She comes back downstairs and she\\u2019s wearing that shimmering gold skirt. I think, \\u201cWow, this is really odd.\\u201d But again I just shrug it off and I\\u2019m trying to get everyone to go. I say, \\u201cWe should call for a cab.\\u201d But Omar\\u2019s friend is driving. I tell them there isn\\u2019t enough room for everyone in the one car. Then suddenly they have other rides and we get in the car and go. We arrive at the concert hall and I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s general admission. We find a place to stand on the floor. I feel like I\\u2019m in the masonic temple or the music hall. I decide it\\u2019s the music hall. It\\u2019s quite dark. The band is playing but there\\u2019s no lights on the stage or upstairs on the balcony. But I recognize the structure and I think, \\u201cOh I know where we are.\\u201d Then we start dancing as though the concert is just a background. It\\u2019s good. Omar and I are dancing and enjoying ourselves. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Two Sisters\\u201d The setting for this dream is my grandparents' house on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The house is really spacious - it\\u2019s very large like a sprawling ranch style house with a deep full basement that you wouldn\\u2019t even know was there until you went into it. There were so many rooms. I used to get lost in there as a child. I think that\\u2019s significant. Both levels open out onto the shore of Lake Ontario. In the bottom level, there\\u2019s been a lot of excavation. The big patio doors open out into a lower area of land and you can walk straight from there down to the shore where there was a boathouse. It\\u2019s also concealed until you get right there. It\\u2019s dug out into the shore. The upper level does the same thing - it has a greenhouse on the side of it and you walk out that door onto the upper level which is a garden. There's plenty of natural light and it feels spacious. Everything is wider and deeper and taller when you\\u2019re in there. In the dream, those details remain consistent with how the house was in real life. I\\u2019m in that house and I\\u2019m walking down the long upstairs hallway into the kitchen. I see someone I know. I realize that she\\u2019s also living in this house and I didn\\u2019t realize she was there. We don\\u2019t speak at first. She\\u2019s just going about her own thing making some food for herself in the large kitchen. I leave the kitchen and walk outside through the greenhouse. I\\u2019m sitting in the garden and gazing out on the expanse of water and it\\u2019s just so spacious. It feels really good. I\\u2019m just resting. I\\u2019m hearing the sounds of bees. I\\u2019m hearing the pollinators as they move from the flowers. My body feels the buzz of life. I stay there for some unknown period of time and then I go back into the house. No one is in the kitchen this time. I walk through the kitchen into a den, a sitting room. The den has two doors - one from the kitchen and one into the hallway. So I walk through it and it\\u2019s an interesting shape. It has eight sides. I\\u2019ve always wondered at the positioning of it. It feels like a pivotal point. I leave it and I walk into the hallway and the roommate or sister that had previously been in the kitchen is coming towards me. We meet in the hallway and she says to me, \\u201cI have something to show you.\\u201d So I\\u2019m engaged in a conversation with her and I don\\u2019t remember what it is. She says, \\u201cJust a minute, I have to go get something else from my room.\\u201d She walks back to her room which is in the basement, so it\\u2019s on the lower level. I follow her a little ways behind. We go down the stairs and I notice that she goes into a room that I previously noticed had a lot of stuff in it. Although I don\\u2019t say this out loud, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow that\\u2019s a lot of stuff. How does she move in that room?\\u201d She goes into the room then comes back out and says to me, as though she heard my thoughts: \\u201cYeah I\\u2019m unpacking everything and re-sorting this all out,\\u201d as though this is a reason for why there\\u2019s so much stuff out all over the place. She says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve cleared this spot.\\u201d And without leaving where we\\u2019re talking, I see inside her room - I\\u2019m not in it. It\\u2019s a square and has stuff everywhere covering every surface of the floor. But there\\u2019s this one spot about 4 feet into the room. It\\u2019s a 4 feet long by 2 feet wide clear spot. She says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019m able to navigate through this clear spot I\\u2019ve made.\\u201d Then my consciousness zooms into the future and sees that she\\u2019s navigated this clear spot. While she was in the process of taking everything out and sorting through it - because she was able to navigate through this clear spot - she\\u2019s become quite comfortable in it. It\\u2019s kind of like she\\u2019s let go of the original intent for taking everything out like that now she\\u2019s comfortable with the clear spot she\\u2019s made. She says to me, \\u201cI still intend to finish this, though. I\\u2019m okay with this spot I\\u2019ve just made. But I will finish it someday in my own way.\\u201d I\\u2019ve forgotten what happens next, but we\\u2019re back upstairs together and she\\u2019s asking me if I want to do something with her. Then another sister comes out and I realize she\\u2019s living here, too, but she hadn\\u2019t been home. She moves really quickly. I realize there\\u2019s some tension between them. The other sister is really frustrated with the first sister because she\\u2019s not moving quickly and she feels that she will be left behind by the first sister. I feel the tension between them, but do not know what to do. I feel torn about doing the something with the first sister while the other sister is still upset at how slowly she\\u2019s moving.\"],[\"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I\\u2019m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There\\u2019s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I\\u2019m packing bags. There\\u2019s a reason, although I don\\u2019t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I\\u2019m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing that?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, I have to do this anyway.\\u201d Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: \\u201cHow old is that child?\\u201d I look down in puzzlement and see that she\\u2019s only five. I think, \\u201cHow did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.\\u201d I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It\\u2019s not safe.\\u201d So, I tell him I\\u2019ve changed my mind. Then I\\u2019m uncertain what to do. Now I\\u2019m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we\\u2019re about to go to. I tell her that it\\u2019s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She\\u2019s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I\\u2019m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It\\u2019s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there\\u2019s one washroom to the left - it\\u2019s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There\\u2019s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we\\u2019re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I\\u2019m able to hear the one person I know - he\\u2019s an author - that he\\u2019s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he\\u2019s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we\\u2019re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I\\u2019m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I\\u2019m getting the feeling that there\\u2019s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don\\u2019t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there\\u2019s two of them - they\\u2019re also talking in hushed tones. I\\u2019m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I\\u2019ve come to this house for and it\\u2019s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn\\u2019t just an idea for a book, it\\u2019s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, \\u201cDo you recognize that?\\u201d I said yes. He says, \\u201cAfter this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.\\u201d So I agree. Then someone comes in that\\u2019s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he\\u2019s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he\\u2019s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s planning this way to get out that\\u2019s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that\\u2019s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I\\u2019m not really listening. I\\u2019m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who\\u2019s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that\\u2019s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat are they up to?\\u201d So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It\\u2019s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there\\u2019s urine all over the seat and it\\u2019s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s urine all over it. There\\u2019s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she\\u2019s still five and as I\\u2019m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I\\u2019ve been talking to and he\\u2019s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he\\u2019s drying it with another towel. He\\u2019s just had a shower. So he\\u2019s involved in what he\\u2019s doing. There\\u2019s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I\\u2019ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I\\u2019ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cWooden Ship\\u201d In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It\\u2019s between 40 and 60 feet long. It\\u2019s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he\\u2019s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it\\u2019s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It\\u2019s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It\\u2019s got debris filtered from the water as it\\u2019s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There\\u2019s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I\\u2019m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven\\u2019t gone all the way out into the body of water. We\\u2019re still going through the channel. I\\u2019m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: \\u201cRandy, it\\u2019s too shallow here, we\\u2019ll never make it through! We\\u2019re going to run aground!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, no, we\\u2019ll be fine. I\\u2019ve done this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s maneuvering the ship and I\\u2019m positive it\\u2019s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you\\u2019re going to scrape your keel. You\\u2019re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don\\u2019t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the ship just didn't run aground.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s because it has no keel.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! So how are we staying balanced?\\u201d Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it\\u2019s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, \\u201cOh, that explains that.\\u201d The dream speeds through the day on the water like it\\u2019s just a minute and we\\u2019re coming back through this same channel. Now it\\u2019s time to tie up. I\\u2019m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that\\u2019s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I\\u2019m climbing up, I realize it\\u2019s not attached to the wall and it\\u2019s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn\\u2019t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I\\u2019m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it\\u2019s a platform, like walking the plank. It\\u2019s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He\\u2019s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I\\u2019m okay. Now I\\u2019m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I\\u2019m standing there talking to him saying, \\u201cHow is this boat balanced without a keel?\\u201d He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it\\u2019s made of wood so it must be light plus it\\u2019s buoyant. There\\u2019s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It\\u2019s actually a hole. I\\u2019m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn\\u2019t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s Crime in Cafes\\u201d It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don\\u2019t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They\\u2019re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don\\u2019t even know how deep it goes. So there\\u2019s a self-serve area at one end - that\\u2019s the end that goes on and on and I don\\u2019t know how deep it goes. At the other end that\\u2019s open, it has long tables where you can take what you\\u2019ve selected and eat there with people. It\\u2019s packed. So, the dream opens and I\\u2019m sitting at a table. I\\u2019m not eating though. I\\u2019m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She\\u2019s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it\\u2019s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we\\u2019re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There\\u2019s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there\\u2019s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it\\u2019s finished, we go to the room next door. There\\u2019s another teacher in there that we\\u2019re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he\\u2019s trying to undermine the first teacher. We\\u2019ve gotten our lunch out and we\\u2019re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we\\u2019re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We\\u2019re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she\\u2019s still there. We share this information with her. She\\u2019s grateful. We tell her that we\\u2019ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you here at the same time the next day.\\u201d So while I\\u2019m lining up to go and get food, first there\\u2019s this thing that happens with gum. There\\u2019s a direction by the cashier - it\\u2019s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, \\u201cWhy are they doing this? I don\\u2019t even want all this gum.\\u201d So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! $50 for something I don\\u2019t even want.\\u201d However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I\\u2019m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don\\u2019t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I\\u2019m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he\\u2019s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no! That\\u2019s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!\\u201d He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn\\u2019t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I\\u2019ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don\\u2019t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There\\u2019s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It\\u2019s crowded and it\\u2019s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There\\u2019s people walking in the street. It\\u2019s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I\\u2019m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what\\u2019s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He\\u2019s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They\\u2019re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don\\u2019t know if they've purchased them or if he\\u2019s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what\\u2019s in the bag. They open it up and there\\u2019s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We\\u2019re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.\\u201d They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He\\u2019s giving it away and he\\u2019s giving it to children. He\\u2019s helping people. I think, \\u201cOh! Well he\\u2019s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they\\u2019re looking for this person?\\u201d So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn\\u2019t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren\\u2019t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I\\u2019m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she\\u2019s there. She\\u2019s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50\\u2019s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it\\u2019s got a rounded collar and she\\u2019s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s dressed up really nicely. She\\u2019s in her good dress.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t see me. In fact, we don\\u2019t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she\\u2019s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I\\u2019m supposed to have, knowing that I can\\u2019t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she\\u2019s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I\\u2019d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can\\u2019t really. I wonder if she\\u2019s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He\\u2019s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He\\u2019s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cyborg in Me\\u201d I entered my dream space as a cyborg. There was no one else in it. I felt nothing. There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn\\u2019t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that\\u2019s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That\\u2019s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn\\u2019t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Nothing\\u201d It seems to me that my apathy and feeling of not belonging, not being able to play anywhere, or seeing that my skills are not needed or wanted anywhere has soaked into my dream...All it was is a dry, hot African steppe. There was nothing in it, no activity. Just a steppe.\"],[\"\\u201cGrey Stone Staircase\\u201d I\\u2019m outside. The landscape is not a river, but a stream, maybe 50 yards wide. There\\u2019s a bridge over top that's made of grey stone and cement. The part you would walk over is no longer there, only the foundation is there. The grey stone part of the bridge spreads down the banks of the stream on either side of it, as well as going down and up the stream. It\\u2019s really, really high. There are stairs carved out of the stone. When you climb up to the top, you can see the air - it\\u2019s whipping around. I can feel my hair whipping across my face. The mist from the river is mixed in with this air, so my hair quickly turns into small ropes and is slapping against my skin. My clothes are slapping against my legs. Looking down creates this really strong sense of vertigo. I\\u2019ve been told to climb up here, yet the stairs aren\\u2019t safe. Once you get up to the top, you walk a little bit and look straight down. There are vertical steps - so not stairs on an incline, but vertical, which is really dangerous, especially in this kind of wind. The water current is one big current and it looks like it\\u2019s muddy and murky because it moves so fast all the time, so all of this stuff from the bottom of the river is stirred up, so you can\\u2019t see through it at all. There\\u2019s other bits of debris, like logs and twigs and other natural items from the earth. I can see a few people way down there. They're just looking at the stairs but not moving. I\\u2019m supposed to climb back down these vertical stairs. I\\u2019m trying, but at this point, my son comes into my room and shouts at me. That\\u2019s enough of a jolt that I\\u2019m able to get up and move my body.\"],[\"\\u201cMacro-Level Choices\\u201d This dream begins where I am part of this diagram, so I\\u2019m watching what feels like a macro-level perspective of different groups of people\\u2019s food choices. What I see with my eyes is a big bluish grey, but not a chart...it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m inside the chart. I realize I'm looking at patterns of people at an anthropological level from around the world and the choices that they make in food. I\\u2019m watching them like small dots. I\\u2019m wondering what this is. I look at them and study them for long enough. They\\u2019re moving. I see almost like an arc, a pendulum, that swings from the cluster of dots of choices they make, and I\\u2019m not even sure that they\\u2019re all food related - I don\\u2019t think they are. They\\u2019re clustering. Then one of the dots will swing out like a pendulum, then pause. It\\u2019s moved into this other category of things that they\\u2019ve learned. The learning is an evolutionary succession. In the dream, I seem to understand the macro-level implications of this without needing to know the exact words or categories of each choice. My thinking brain is in wonderment at realizing what all these small clusters of activity arrive at - like an aha! Then I move from realizing that some of them are food choices. The dreams shifts from a macro-level to what is happening right now on the earth. Then I arrive in a restaurant. I\\u2019m looking at people\\u2019s food choices. It starts at a table with a woman I haven\\u2019t seen in a long time - Margie is one of my daughter\\u2019s friend\\u2019s mothers. I haven\\u2019t seen her since my daughter was in Grade 8 because the kids ended up going to different high schools. Margie sits down and makes some kind of comment like, \\u201cI thought we were friends, but you never contacted.\\u201d I express surprise at this and say, \\u201cYes, I live over here now and work every evening as well as in the day. I don\\u2019t have time for that kind of thing.\\u201d She seems to feel amenable to that explanation and starts talking to me about her family. As she\\u2019s talking, this other young lad, maybe 17, is hovering around the table and moving things. He\\u2019s getting his backpack and he\\u2019s putting things in it. Then he slides into the role of server and is cleaning some of the plates away. Only Margie\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s plate is left. Now I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s some kind of older step brother and wonder if she has remarried since I knew her. But I look at the young man and he has some features that look like Margie\\u2019s husband. So now I\\u2019m wondering if this young man is maybe a child of the previous marriage of the husband, which means they could still be together and I\\u2019m just seeing this man grown up. Then the scene shifts from the table in a restaurant. I\\u2019m now in the kitchen in their house. People are packing up and clearing away dishes from the table, still. Margie has asked me if I\\u2019ll come over for tea. I agree to do this. My own son has somehow been invited to go back and forth from my house to hers, which is actually something she would do - organize families on this slightly macro-level as dinner is going on because she is an accountant. He\\u2019s now only 7 and he has a scooter. There's the question of how he will get his things from my house to hers on this scooter. I tell him to try it right now: \\u201cPut all the things you have with you in a bag and we\\u2019ll weigh it. Is it too heavy to swing from one handle of the scooter?\\u201d It is. It will pull him off balance a bit. So I say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we roll the bag and I\\u2019ll bungee cord it to the back of the scooter. No one uses that space anyway. Then it will keep the mechanics more balanced.\\u201d Margie says, \\u201cOh yes! That\\u2019s a really good idea!\\u201d My son is now on the road and he gives it a couple tries up and down and says, \\u201cYes, it works.\\u201d Now I'm back in the kitchen - in the thought of the kitchen. The dream is shifting me through thought patterns. The young man is now ready to go and he hasn\\u2019t said anything I ask him if he needs a ride because he seems to be hovering. I ask him how he\\u2019s going to move from Place A to Place B. He declines the ride. Now, the dream pattern shifts and I\\u2019m in a restaurant and serving tables, moving food from underneath the heat lamp where it\\u2019s cooked in the kitchen out to the tables - I\\u2019m coordinating that. It tells you where to go because it has the name of the server on the paper beside the food as well as the table number. So I just do this for a little bit. Then my shift is over and I\\u2019m sitting in the breakroom counting up money and adding that up when one of the cooks comes in from the kitchen and says, \\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\\u201d I realize I\\u2019m not on the schedule for next week and the rest of the staff seem to know this and are questioning why this has happened. Each person, there\\u2019s probably 5 or 6 people who come into contact with me and tell me they\\u2019re surprised by this, and that I was doing a new job, and they are sorry to see me go, and then some questions about how they\\u2019ll keep in touch with me. I\\u2019m wondering, thinking, \\u201cOh so it\\u2019s not just me not knowing why I\\u2019ve been let go.\\u201d I decide after all of this to go into the office to see if I can ask why. I\\u2019m looking for closure. The part of the administration that\\u2019s responsible for scheduling doesn\\u2019t know the answer to that question and evades me when I ask direct questions, but doesn\\u2019t seem hostile. There\\u2019s the energy of feeling that person doesn\\u2019t know why they\\u2019ve been requested to do that either. So, I leave, put everything in my pack, make sure I\\u2019ve left nothing behind, and say final goodbyes. And here\\u2019s this young man again from the other thought pattern - the guy that might possibly be Margie\\u2019s stepson. He\\u2019s leaving at the same time, but now he\\u2019s asking me if I need a ride. I say, \\u201cNo thank you. I\\u2019ve got a car in the parking lot.\\u201d So I walk out with my things and put them in the car. I notice he\\u2019s putting his things in a red car. When he leaves, it\\u2019s really noisy. Then I get in mine. Now there\\u2019s snow on the ground. I\\u2019m testing my brakes. The brakes aren\\u2019t where they should be. So I gear down to navigate my car out of the parking lot because I have to make a right hand turn. Gearing down works and gives me a little extra time to figure out where the brake pedal has been moved to. It\\u2019s weight over on the left in a really odd place, where the clutch would be. But I\\u2019ve got it now. I have to make another right hand turn. Suddenly there\\u2019s a bus. The whole left hand lane is stopped, so I go even further left to go around. It\\u2019s okay even though my tires don\\u2019t really have traction in the snow. Now I'm driving through a city. I start job hunting. I stop at a few restaurants on my way home after applying to three different restaurants. They all say they don\\u2019t need anyone. Now I\\u2019ve driven to the complete opposite end of town and am back in the house where I would meet Margie for tea.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arms Dealer\\u201d This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he\\u2019s not there to buy books. I realize I\\u2019m not in my own body because I see my arm and it\\u2019s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that\\u2019s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can\\u2019t see the other two names, but that\\u2019s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that\\u2019s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That\\u2019s the point I realize they\\u2019ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he\\u2019s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, \\u201cOkay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?\\u201d They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, \\u201cEh, shouldn\\u2019t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren\\u2019t we not supposed to jostle this material or there\\u2019s the danger of it exploding?\\u201d Man consciousness me says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d The part of my own consciousness that\\u2019s trapped in there says, \\u201cYou have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can\\u2019t have any cough. It\\u2019s not supposed to be jostled once.\\u201d I feel frustrated inside this guy\\u2019s consciousness. Then, he has a few things that he\\u2019s gathered and puts his arms around them and carries them. It feels like the way it would feel as though you were carrying two bags of groceries with loaves of bread in them with one tucked under each arm. I compare it to this. Then he walks up the alleyway and into his house. I notice that the house is really overcrowded and has toys and books and stuff everywhere - belonging to someone who never cleans up. Then he goes into the kitchen and the rack they use in restaurants for putting dishes on and then putting them through an autoclave machine - he sets three loaves of bread on the dish rack and puts them in the oven, but doesn\\u2019t turn it on yet. He\\u2019s still got this dry cough, and I think, \\u201cWow, isn\\u2019t this guy going to take care of that?\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t. Then he sits down at the table, ostensibly to wait while these things do whatever they have to do in the oven. Then the part of the man that\\u2019s my consciousness starts to take over and the man consciousness starts to go away. Now I\\u2019m me and I\\u2019m sitting there looking around at this mess and thinking, \\u201cUgh, I have to start cleaning this up.\\u201d Then across from the table, Omar appears. I tell him, \\u201cWhat is wrong with these people? Why is everybody in denial? There's so many other choices that people make. I don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d He nods his head and agrees, then asks me if it\\u2019s okay if he uses my bicycle from the garage. I say, \\u201cYeah, do you know which one it is?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I think so. It\\u2019s the one your ex-husband\\u2019s been using.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?! What are you talking about? Why would either one of you want to use my bicycle?\\u201d It\\u2019s got the two white bars that go down and purple - it looks like a girl\\u2019s bike. He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it looks like now.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat does it look like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, your husband modified it. It\\u2019s got a motorcycle seat on it. And he took out the hump in the middle, so you can sit upright on it.\\u201d I\\u2019m starting to get riled up because he never asked me if he could do that. Then I look back at Omar and say, \\u201cThis is the problem! He never respects my boundaries and he always does these things without asking first. Do you think it\\u2019s unreasonable that it upsets me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo that is a normal thing.\\u201d Then he makes reference to his ex-wife and he says, \\u201cEven in my marriage, we asked each other for permission.\\u201d Then he starts laughing and he takes a piece of paper and shows me - it\\u2019s written the way you would write out a script in a play with the one person\\u2019s name, then the colon and the line then the other person. There\\u2019s 10 lines of just one-liners. First it\\u2019s him and his ex-wife, him and his ex-wife, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, all the way down. Then one of them throws their hands up in exasperation and says: \\u201cOkay fine!\\u201d So he just hands it to me and I read this. Then he\\u2019s laughing and says, \\u201cWell at least it\\u2019s agreement.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m laughing, too, and say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s better than just taking it without asking, then modifying, then just walking away again, leaving it in the modified form so I can\\u2019t use it anymore.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cAlright, well I have to go to work.\\u201d So I follow him down the hallway. As I\\u2019m passing through the kitchen, I look at the store and think, \\u201cWhy is it at 77 degrees Celsius?!\\u201d I look with alarm and think, \\u201cOh yeah, that\\u2019s from the man consciousness body.\\u201d I see the three loaves of bread in there and they are starting to disintegrate with the heat. It\\u2019s vaporizing the plastic bags, and I think, \\u201cOh, isn\\u2019t that going to melt and cause some trouble in there?\\u201d But the temperature is so high that it just vaporizes. Then I realize I have to leave that there because this is the man consciousness\\u2019 house. But when I get in the hallway and go to say goodbye to Omar, I see two jackets. I realize one is the 4 year old boy, one is the 8 year old boy, and I look at Omar in alarm and say, \\u201cWhat are they doing here in this house?! They\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d But the part of me that is also in the man\\u2019s body sees that they belong to his kids. The consciousness that is me suddenly categorizes the overcrowding of stuff and not tidying up and putting away is from his kids. He\\u2019s making this money and also has this dual role of taking care of his family even though he\\u2019s doing it illegally. At that moment, he\\u2019s simultaneously opening the door and there\\u2019s my own two cats. They get out of the house and start to go up the street which is now a different street. It\\u2019s crowded with people and families. Kids are playing in the snow and it\\u2019s wintertime. Everybody has on snowsuits. There are toboggans and some ice and people are skating. I see my one cat has been interested by a bird. There is a group of people that are around my other cat and they\\u2019re putting snow on him and patting him with the snow and he\\u2019s enjoying it. So I get her first - I catch her just before she leaps into the air to take off after the bird. But I know I can\\u2019t carry them both at the same time. So as I\\u2019m walking back to what is now my own house, I see Kathryn, one of my students, and I ask if she can hold my cat for a moment while I get the other one. She says, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019ll just grab this one.\\u201d And she gets the second cat while I still have my first cat and am putting him back in the house. Then she sets him down for a second while she frolics off and does something else. I just think, \\u201cWhat is wrong with people that they just can\\u2019t follow through?\\u201d Then I put my tiny almost brittle cat back (her spine is uncomfortable when you pick her up and she gets squirmy) in the house and pick up my other one - he\\u2019s much heavier. I can feel his fur and his heavy body and his skin. So now they\\u2019re both back in the house. Everybody is safe and it\\u2019s just my house. My dream ends there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Greenhouse\\u201d This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I\\u2019m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He\\u2019s in a van and he comes out of the van. He\\u2019s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there\\u2019s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can\\u2019t because he can\\u2019t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I\\u2019m draggin him up with me so he can get there. Now it\\u2019s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we\\u2019re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I\\u2019m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it\\u2019s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there\\u2019s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They\\u2019re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They\\u2019re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo! Stop, stop!\\u201d The cat goes backwards, but doesn\\u2019t see where it\\u2019s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I\\u2019m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It\\u2019s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I\\u2019m cradling it in my arms and see that it\\u2019s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The other one is still in there. The cat starts to squirm and wants to get down. The ex comes in and says, \\u201cHow did this mud get in here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, Luke must have tracked it in.\\u201d He glares at me and gets really angry and says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you dare say that name out loud.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? He was here. Didn't you see him outside at the top of the hill?\\u201d Now he\\u2019s really mad at me and tells me I\\u2019m a liar and stop saying that. So I say to him, \\u201cYou didn't see him?\\u201d Then he storms out of the house. Then I remember that Luke told me to get vinegar to pour on it. So I go into the kitchen to get vinegar out from underneath the sink. I pour it on top of the mud that has the maggots and stuff in it. They all die. Then as I\\u2019m cleaning up, the dream deconstructs. I\\u2019m suddenly in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house. I\\u2019m in the process of planting a garden. Their house is huge. It\\u2019s like a mansion down by the shore of the lake. The greenhouse has long raised beds in it and really tall domed windows that arc over the top. They\\u2019re really dirty. There\\u2019s an old garden that looks like it hasn\\u2019t been tended for a while. I leave the greenhouse and walk across the grounds into a shed and find some tools. But as I open the shed door - it\\u2019s creaky and there are cobwebs. I find a hoe and some shears. I take them back to the greenhouse. I start to till and aerate the earth with the hoe. I notice that some of the plants that decayed and died have seeds in them. I\\u2019m making sure that I shake the plant - agitate it a little, so some of the seeds go into the earth as I\\u2019m hoeing. Then a man comes up - I assume he is the gardener. He is wearing a uniform and he questions what I\\u2019m doing. I tell him I am restoring the garden. He starts giving me some instructions. I say, \\u201cDid you used to be the gardener here?\\u201d He says yes. I realize that he\\u2019s also dead. He can\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s instructing me to do. So I listen to him. I ask if he knows where there\\u2019s any vinegar. He says, \\u201cYes, there is some here. I will arrange for it to be delivered to you.\\u201d So I start to till up one side - there are two long raised beds, 30 feet long each. As I till the greyed earth on top, I see there\\u2019s rich black earth underneath. I feel inspired by this task. Then I see that some kind of delivery has appeared. I remember that I also asked him for some balck earth. So there\\u2019s a bag of black earth and some vinegar. There\\u2019re also buckets, cloths and a sponge mop. I think, \\u201cGreat, I can wash these windows so the sun can come through.\\u201d I do that. It looks beautiful. Then on the other side, there\\u2019s a child - I don\\u2019t know who it is. I start showing them how to till up the earth so that seeds can be planted in holes, then how you can make the raised be up around the small plants, then you\\u2019ve got a little line between where water can go and people can walk if needed. So this child is helping me, but I still don\\u2019t know who it is. At the end of the day, I end up with some tall seed flowers in the back, some sustainable things we can eat coming up, as well as some herbs. There\\u2019s soup herbs, soup vegetables, fruit, nuts, pollinator flowers and natural insect repellent flowers. I picked red, yellow, orange and purple flowers. So it\\u2019s going to be a beautiful garden. We\\u2019re not all done, but it\\u2019s just too much to do in one day, so we leave. The child disappears. I\\u2019m walking across the grounds which are quite large. It takes a little bit of time to walk. When I get to the other side, I\\u2019m at the road. I walk up the road. I start to go through the outskirts and through old suburbia with 300 year old trees. I come to a house and realize it\\u2019s a rental. There\\u2019s a bottom floor for rent and top floor for rent. Suddenly a real estate agent appears and is describing when the tenants are leaving. The bottom floor is going to be empty today, the top floor tenants aren\\u2019t going to be leaving for a couple weeks. So she asks if I\\u2019m interested in the bottom floor. Since they are in the process of moving, it\\u2019s okay for us to go in. I really like it. I love the treed lot. There\\u2019s lots of natural shade over the sleeping area. The bedrooms are large and I like how the bedrooms are separated from the activity part of the house. So it will be good for sleeping. The kitchen is nice and big - there\\u2019s enough space for eating and a prep area. So I tell her that I\\u2019ll take it, but I\\u2019m also wanting to put a catio outside of the entry to the backyard so I can put my cats in it and they'll have lots of space to climb and run. Now the current tenant is there. Suddenly he has something I can easily use as a catio. He has a strange creature in it. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog, but as I get closer, I realize it\\u2019s some kind of rodent about the size of a small dog. I think it\\u2019s from South America. He\\u2019s a very sullen man - he doesn\\u2019t look like he wants to talk. I do ask him what kind of pet that is. He doesn\\u2019t answer me. He keeps the same expression on his face. We go back into the house and now I realize that I need roommates for this because there are four bedrooms and I can\\u2019t afford it by myself. There's the question of who will be the roommates. The real estate agent is interviewing some people. Two of them I know there is no way I can live with. One is someone I know and have actually lived with before, and I say, \\u201cYes, that will work. Please interview her.\\u201d Suddenly I\\u2019m moved in and I\\u2019ve been living there for a little while. I have two other roommates. I feel like they came with the house. The one roommate\\u2019s bedroom, when I\\u2019m trying to sleep, they\\u2019re sleeping area moves out like an extending wall in a motorhome. When he goes in to sleep, the bed extends over the feet of my bed and I can\\u2019t stretch my legs out when I'm sleeping. So I don\\u2019t like this arrangement. I contact the real estate agent and say, \\u201cOkay, it\\u2019s been a couple weeks. Are the other tenants getting ready to move out?\\u201d She says yes. So I look at their place. It\\u2019s a little smaller, but I will still be able to keep the catio for my cats. So my dream ends where I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cCan we either ask these two other guys to move out, or is it okay that I just transfer my lease to the other side of the house?\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cLocked Out\\u201d In the dream, I am supposed to teach at the Yoga Studio. I have loaded my car up with the props and driven to the town where the studio is. The town is actually really pretty, like a turn of the century town, probably built around the railroad. There are still remnants of that in the architecture, cobblestone, and gaslights on the street that have been converted to electricity. I meet the staff of the Yoga Studio at the coffee shop across the street. We chat about some upcoming themes. I cross the street with them. I\\u2019ve parked my car behind that building. They unlock the Yoga Studio and we go in to teach. We set up and I teach a yoga class. I come out and a man is sitting there. I don\\u2019t recall him being inthe class. We have a little conversation. I know him from university. One of the other staff comes out and suggests to the owner in front of me that my class was insensitive to someone\\u2019s trauma. The owner lets out a guffaw, because if anything, I\\u2019m known for my sensitivity to that kind of thing. She says, \\u201cWhat do you mean? Can you describe it?\\u201d The other staff member lifts her arms up towards the sky, bends her knees a little bit and says that someone\\u2019s thigh may have touched their belly in that pose. Again, the owner says, \\u201cWell if someone is that sensitive to themselves, then they shouldn\\u2019t be coming to class.\\u201d Meanwhile, I haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m surprised that things have gotten this far where sensitivities are so cloistered that they can\\u2019t even be in a yoga class and we keep changing the world to adjust to that level of sensitivity. I\\u2019m kind of mulling that around in my mind thinking, \\u201cIs there any way to make the class more trauma-aware to body touching? Or has this gone too far?\\u201d So I\\u2019m thinking about this as everybody gathers up their things and leaves the building. By now, it\\u2019s nighttime. The owners lock the door and get in their car. Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my keys. I cross the street quickly and am yelling their names. I realize there are three cars with people in them and none are the owners, although I didn\\u2019t see them drive away. So I can\\u2019t get back into the studio to get my keys. I cross back the street again, which incidentally has a lovely median with a beautiful garden of flowers you can see in the dark. Now there are Parisienne cafe tables that only fit an espresso cup and saucer - maybe three or four, with people sitting there. I am hesitant to say anything to them. But I don't know what I\\u2019m going to do. I have no way to get in my car. I have no way to get home. It\\u2019s dark. I don't have my wallet. I don\\u2019t have my purse. I don\\u2019t have my cell phone. So I know the studio is not going to open until morning. I don\\u2019t know the studio owners\\u2019 phone numbers by heart. But this one man turns around and says to me, \\u201cUm, are you locked out?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, I am. Sorry to trouble you, but I\\u2019m wondering if it\\u2019s okay if I use somebody\\u2019s phone?\\u201d I need to look up a number. The woman sitting in front of me - she\\u2019s probably a 20-year-old girl - hands me her cell phone. As I take it into my hand, I notice the buttons are plastic and raised. Even the action of bringing my finger from the bottom to the top sets off this string of numbers on the screen and I don't know how to erase that and I\\u2019ve never seen a cell phone keypad like this. The man beside me reaches over and corrects it for me. Then I dial 911, but every time I touch it, it enters four nines, and eight ones. I mimic what he did - I run my finger up from the bottom to the top and it goes away. I try it three or four times, and it\\u2019s so sensitive no matter how lightly I touch it. Then I realize, \\u201cOh! Wait a minute. 911 is emergency. I need 411.\\u201d So when I punch in 411 lightly it goes in immediately. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s some kind of resistance to the phone to having 911 dialed for it. How interesting is that?\\u201d The 411 goes to some kind of opening where you have to speak and say the name, and it will automatically pull up numbers. So I do this and say the studio owner\\u2019s name. Then a screen pops up and I have to move my finger along the sliding scale for the distance I want covered as they search this name; otherwise, 9,000 versions will come up. So I do that. I slide the ruler around. I find the border of the town where I think she lives and I slide the ruler there. It comes up with 20 numbers. I have no idea which one is hers. I get discouraged. I tell the woman, \\u201cThank you, but here is your phone.\\u201d So now I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to sleep. I know she lives close to the studio. She hasn't asked me if I need anything else yet. I stand there and then start to go up the street. All of a sudden, she\\u2019s in front of me. I see that she goes up an alleyway. I don\\u2019t follow her. I don\\u2019t see where she goes. I wait a few minutes. I\\u2019m in a parking lot behind the stores.There are only two levels of this building - the store on the bottom level and the apartments on the top. I choose one balcony. I think it\\u2019s hers because I know she has a cat and it looks like a cat would live there. There are some boxes piled up around. I climb into one of these boxes and think I\\u2019ll just stay here for the night. It\\u2019s not that cold out. Then, my dream shifts for a moment. That same staff member that said my classes weren\\u2019t sensitive to body-touch - it\\u2019s morning and she\\u2019s also sleeping in a box. We start to have a conversation when I look over and see three balconies down, a man hanging onto a blanket and another man trying to pull him up. The first man looks like he\\u2019s still asleep. As I stand up, I notice we\\u2019re not just one floor up from the ground, we\\u2019re 60! I get this big sense of vertigo and I can\\u2019t balance on my feet. It\\u2019s snowing out. His eyes and lips are blue and he either looks dead or frozen as though he\\u2019s stayed out all night long. The other man is pulling him up. The first man\\u2019s hand is stuck to the blanket and the other man is pulling him up. Now she runs out through the apartment, which is now hers, ostensibly to go down the hall to bang on the front door and ask if they need any help. But very quickly, the first man pulls him up and over. I think I should go tell her, but I don't because I realize by the time I get there, she\\u2019ll already know this information So I just wait till she comes back. Then the scene shifts back again. It\\u2019s just me outside this other young girl\\u2019s apartment. The balcony door is open now. I can see into her kitchen, which is really messy. There\\u2019s a washing machine and dryer, as well as a sink. It's very tiny. There\\u2019s laundry on the floor and things that haven't been put away on top of the counters. The cat comes in and I see it. It\\u2019s trying to climb up this stack of things because there\\u2019s a food bag up there. It\\u2019s going to feed itself. But as it is climbing up this stack of parcels and dirty laundry, the pile collapses and the cat slides down. I am just standing there, amused by this, watching the cat navigate through when she comes through the door to pick the kitty up. She sees me and says, \\u201cHave you been out there all night?\\u201d I say yes. She says, \\u201cOh come on in, you don\\u2019t have to stand out there.\\u201d So I come in and ask if I can use the washroom. She says yes. Then the scene flips and it\\u2019s like a replay, only I'm outside and her house is this little tiny house in the middle of the desert. There are men on camels and they\\u2019re fighting and having some kind of war. Now both of us, the girl and I , are trying to race towards her house for safety before one of these warring guys hits us with whatever they\\u2019re throwing at each other. We do and now we\\u2019re back inside. Inside the house, I look down and think I\\u2019m okay to teach wearing this. I have stretchy capris underneath a wrap around sarong. My shirt will do and I have a jean jacket on top. I think, \\u201cAlright, I\\u2019m good to go. I can teach my morning class. I\\u2019ll find my keys in the studio, then return home and all this will be just fine.\\u201d The girl and I leave. She\\u2019s going to the morning yoga class anyway. We return to the studio. As we\\u2019re walking, I imagine that I see my keys on the studio counter. But I don't actually enter into the studio. My dream ends there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Board Meeting\\u201d In this dream, I am in a townhouse complex. It opens and I\\u2019m having a day to myself where I realize I can do whatever I want. I\\u2019ve decided I\\u2019m just going to play my guitar. I get my guitar out and am setting it up. I see out my window that my stepmother is leaving. Through the window, although I can\\u2019t hear her voice, she tells me that she\\u2019s told the board of directors that I\\u2019m going to take her place for the day and be the secretary and record her notes. I\\u2019m annoyed and then she\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t even have time to tell her this is my only day to myself and I didn\\u2019t even agree to this. Now instead of having the day, the board of directors is filing into my house. I notice that they\\u2019re the seniors from the day at the whaling place when they were just there as onlookers at this whaling equipment and remarking over it. This also annoys me. The meeting starts and they\\u2019re talking about things. As I\\u2019m recording this, I\\u2019m noticing that no one is really sharing the conversation. No decision is being made. They\\u2019re just talking about everything. They move from one thing to another and it\\u2019s taking an extraordinary long period of time and it\\u2019s unproductive. I start doodling on my page and not really recording anything. Then they get to a conversation where someone has brought up that they smell marijuana in the complex. I think to myself, \\u201cWell, of course you do. It\\u2019s legal in Canada now.\\u201dThey\\u2019re talking about the smell. They don\\u2019t like walking through smells. I think to myself, \\u201cyeah, I\\u2019ve smelled it for about half a second when I\\u2019ve been in a canoe on the water and no one else is around. I\\u2019ve smelled it for another half a second when I\\u2019m walking on a sidewalk to the grocery store.\\u201d So the clouds of smoke from somebody\\u2019s house half a mile away have drifted around like other smells do from the kitchen and people\\u2019s bathrooms. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much longer are they going to go on talking about the smell and they can\\u2019t even do anything about it. This meeting is unproductive.\\u201d So I set down the pad of paper I\\u2019m writing on and I wander off to a different area of the room. I actually get my guitar out again and wonder if they can hear me. I start tuning it very quietly and no one says anything. Then I start playing a song. Then I hear on the agenda that they\\u2019re talking about someone who has asked for a refund of $26.57 for something the board processed that they shouldn\\u2019t have. I think, \\u201cOh, that was me! That was years and years ago. I\\u2019d forgotten about that.\\u201d So I set my guitar down and go back to the table. I\\u2019m listening to the process of their conversation and wondering if they just talk about this at every meeting for three years and never get it off their list? I wonder if they\\u2019re going to get it off their list this time. I don\\u2019t even care about it now and it\\u2019s a small amount. I\\u2019d forgotten about what it was for and as I\\u2019m listening to the conversation, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh yeah, they shouldn\\u2019t have charged me for that. So one of the men that was on the whaling excursion, he's sayinsaucerg that she\\u2019s right and they should reimburse her the money. He doesn\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s me. Someone else from the board says, \\u201cWell, where will the money come from?\\u201d I mentally roll my eyes and think, \\u201cGeez, they don\\u2019t even have a treasurer.\\u201d Then someone else says, \\u201cWe need to put in a request for that.\\u201d Then I just wander away from the table again, thinking, \\u201cWow, they will never get anything done. Maybe they\\u2019re just here because there\\u2019s nothing else for them to do.\\u201d I go back to my guitar.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Swan Costume\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m in Spain, I think. It\\u2019s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I\\u2019m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it\\u2019s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He\\u2019s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that\\u2019s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I\\u2019m in a different country. I'm a different person. I\\u2019m in a kitchen scene where I\\u2019m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there\\u2019s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I\\u2019m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I\\u2019m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I\\u2019m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It\\u2019s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s kind of interesting.\\u201d I look at it. I have the plant in the other hand. I think, \\u201cHmm, now the seeds from the plant are gone.\\u201d I\\u2019m moving the slats on the shudder in a cupboard and it\\u2019s chafed the seeds out and collected them. So I close the cupboard board and put the bare plant on the counter. I turn around and now there are more dishes on the island. My sibling is doing nothing. I speak sharply to him. I refresh the water in the sink and put the plug back in. I notice that there\\u2019s 4 inches of unwashed cutlery in the bottom that he's been pretending to do. I speak sharply to him about that. Then I do some of it myself, but am thinking that if I keep doing this myself, he\\u2019s never going to learn to do it. So I put fresh water in then turn the tap off and tell him he needs to do his work if he\\u2019s ever going to get out of the area. I go back and finish my own. I\\u2019m disgusted in the dream by the sludge in the bottom of the sink and the pile of food bits and organic waste in the plug that I have to pluck out and dump. The dream flips back to the other scene where I\\u2019m in this palazzo in Spain. Now, the day has progressed and it\\u2019s almost nighttime. My father\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t know where he is. I\\u2019m suddenly supposed to be helping these people find costumes for a masquerade. They come in and I\\u2019m at the end of the palazzo. There\\u2019s a really long bar of clothing hanging from it. People are coming in one at a time, saying what they want to look like. I go through the clothes hanging from the bar and I hand them one and they just walk away with it. It\\u2019s not a line up and not a popular thing. I start to look through the clothing. I become absorbed by the feel of the material. The satins are really dark, the black is really inky and they feel smooth under my fingers. Then this woman comes up. She says, \\u201cDo I have something that will make her have a more shapely butt?\\u201d I think, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I start looking through the clothing and I find something. She says, \\u201cHow do I use this?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m wearing black gloves. As I\\u2019m looking through, the knowledge comes to me and I say, \\u201cYou put this part on and it pushes your low back down into your butt, which loosens the skin a bit. Then you put this part on and it pushes from the hamstrings up to fill it.\\u201d Then I warn her that it says on the tag to be very careful because this can be hard or dangerous for your low back. Then there\\u2019s a costumed part that goes around the upper body. It kind of looks like a man\\u2019s lapel from a suit. So she takes it anyway and walks away. Then I\\u2019m concerned about this. I go to try and find the mother - she\\u2019s not my mother, she\\u2019s just another part of the family that works there. I tell her that someone just wanted that costume. She doesn\\u2019t reply to my question. She says, \\u201cI have something I think you would really like. Wait here for a second.\\u201d She goes and gets it. It\\u2019s white. She says, \\u201cHere, feel this.\\u201d I feel it and it\\u2019s got form to it. It\\u2019s white. There\\u2019s a feathery feel, like the way feathers would feel on a white bird if you just ran your hand over the top of its head and down towards the back with the grain of the feathers. It\\u2019s not stretchy material. It has form to it like a ballet dancer\\u2019s costume. She says to go try it on. As I do this, I see her nephew come in. He\\u2019s a man. He sees me holding that in my hand. Then he looks down. I feel there\\u2019s some kind of disapproval and also some attraction in his eyes. I go into the bathroom and put it on. I make sure I go into the small bathroom only made for only one person because I don\\u2019t want anyone else to see me in this, but I do want to see what it looks like. It has a full length mirror in it. So I put it on. I like the way it contrasts with my brown skin. It feels really nice when I put it on. It has a little bit of weight to it. When I turn around and look in the back, first I notice there\\u2019s a bikini line on my body which is at odds with the line of the costume. The back of the costume comes up like a thong and there\\u2019s a big scooped part that goes up over my hips from the leg. Because it\\u2019s got form to it, it doesn\\u2019t sit on my body - it doesn\\u2019t cling to it. It moves a little bit when I move. I\\u2019m slightly concerned about this because it\\u2019s a bit big for me. But I turn around and it\\u2019s also got these four other pieces that are about maybe 8 inches long, curved gently like an \\u201cS\\u201d the way the downstruck in treble clef goes. They\\u2019re also white and they\\u2019ve got downy feathers around the top. I realize they\\u2019re to frame my eyes. They tuck in with little straps at the top of the costume quite nicely and stay there. So the one curved in sits on the top of the shoulder and it goes up the side of my neck and then curves again gently underneath my eyes towards the inside of my nose. There are two on each side - one goes to the inside of the eye, one goes to the outside of the eye. I actually really like these and I spend a few moments admiring the craftsmanship , the velvety feel of them and the way they fit over the top of the shoulders. I like how they feel around the outside of my eyes. They kind of hide the eyes, too, because it\\u2019s like a masquerade. Then I turn around because I\\u2019m concerned that the costume moves a little bit of its own accord when I\\u2019m walking. Now I notice I\\u2019ve got these really high white heels on. I\\u2019m wishing there was some carpeting on the floor because they\\u2019re quite slippery against the painted stucco and that makes me feel a little nervous. But as I turn around and check out the back again, I bend over a little and think I can't bend over in this and have anyone see me because you can see more of my anatomy than I want roving eyes to be looking at. But as I do this, I feel myself turned on. I feel that move from my body as I look back at the front view in the mirror, I feel heat between my legs and a warmth in my yoni that\\u2019s spreading outwards. I can feel the beginnings of an orgasm and this wakes me up.\"],[\"\\u201cGetting Ready to Cast Off\\u201d I\\u2019m on my friend Lynn\\u2019s sailboat. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We\\u2019re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I\\u2019ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I\\u2019m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we\\u2019re waiting because the wind has died down. We\\u2019re waiting for the wind to pick up. There\\u2019s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It\\u2019s really silly. I\\u2019m on this dinghy and it\\u2019s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I\\u2019m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I\\u2019m hanging on to the mast and sail. It\\u2019s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I\\u2019m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, \\u201cHmm, I could actually fall asleep here.\\u201d I\\u2019m in danger of doing so. I think, \\u201cWell, I better not fall asleep.\\u201d So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, \\u201cWell, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.\\u201d I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I\\u2019m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I\\u2019m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it\\u2019s not in the dreamscape anymore. I\\u2019m swinging around on this rope. I\\u2019m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I\\u2019m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I\\u2019m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I\\u2019ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn\\u2019t get tangled on anything. Now I\\u2019m wondering what else I\\u2019m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they\\u2019ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, \\u201cOh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I\\u2019ll paint rocks.\\u201d So all of a sudden, there\\u2019s another person who I actually work with, though I\\u2019ve never sailed with her - I don\\u2019t think she sails. She\\u2019s been invited to go on the boat. I\\u2019m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she\\u2019s doing to pass the time and she\\u2019s painting rocks. I think, \\u201cWell this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she\\u2019s used.\\u201d I kind of go up tentatively because I don\\u2019t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, \\u201cWhat kind of paint are you using for that?\\u201d She tells me that it\\u2019s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, \\u201cNo, I just came back from Michael\\u2019s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they\\u2019re doing something that\\u2019s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.\\u201d So I ask her where it is and she says, \\u201cHere, it\\u2019s on this map and it\\u2019s marked with an X so that we don\\u2019t go there.\\u201d I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don\\u2019t want Lynn to know I\\u2019ve gone to Michael\\u2019s as well because she\\u2019ll be upset. So I think, \\u201cI\\u2019ll just go to the Dollar Store.\\u201d As I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store, I don\\u2019t have any shoes. I\\u2019m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they\\u2019re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I\\u2019ve got a bag. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I\\u2019ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It\\u2019s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we\\u2019re going to cat off. But we don\\u2019t! It\\u2019s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she\\u2019s been sewing something. She asks me if I\\u2019d like to make something. I say, \\u201cWell, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you\\u2019re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it\\u2019s very cooling. So I\\u2019ll make one of those.\\u201d So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That\\u2019s the end of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cSpirit People\\u201d I\\u2019m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they\\u2019re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We\\u2019re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don\\u2019t say anything. I\\u2019m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it\\u2019s on the top floor. She says, \\u201cThis is where we\\u2019re supposed to go - my contact is up here.\\u201d We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we\\u2019re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we\\u2019re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I\\u2019m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, \\u201cWait here. I\\u2019ll be back in a moment.\\u201d So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.\\u201d The first yoga class is all the bride\\u2019s family. They\\u2019re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that\\u2019s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I\\u2019m figuring there\\u2019s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they\\u2019re serving food. They\\u2019re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren\\u2019t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I\\u2019m suggesting we leave. But they\\u2019re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they\\u2019re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person\\u2019s hair. I look and it\\u2019s someone I recognize. I didn\\u2019t know her very well, though, and I hadn\\u2019t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I\\u2019d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I\\u2019m hugging her and saying, \\u201cWow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so very long,\\u201d I realize in my dream mind that she\\u2019s dead. We don\\u2019t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I\\u2019m seeing more people that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there\\u2019s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don\\u2019t know her - we don\\u2019t have any close conversations. She\\u2019s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, \\u201cOh, that can\\u2019t be good and why don\\u2019t you say something...you\\u2019re passive to this?\\u201d Then her son comes up. I just know it\\u2019s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: \\u201cI can tell whose son this is!\\u201d I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, \\u201cAlright, it\\u2019s time to go. We don\\u2019t have anything to do here.\\u201d So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re just gone. I look down and I\\u2019ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they\\u2019re attached. I think, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t mine.\\u201d I know where it\\u2019s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, \\u201cHey, I think this is yours.\\u201d He looks at it and says, \\u201cOh, I haven\\u2019t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.\\u201d I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I\\u2019m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can\\u2019t accept it until I\\u2019ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I\\u2019m waiting and it looks like he\\u2019s going to disappear back into the store and I\\u2019ve still got this pot I\\u2019m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it\\u2019s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I\\u2019m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I\\u2019m walking into Mandy\\u2019s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it\\u2019s been there for ages. There\\u2019s another pair over by the sink. There\\u2019s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I\\u2019m just hearing the voice and deduce that it\\u2019s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It\\u2019s covered with seran wrap. It\\u2019s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, \\u201cOh, she\\u2019s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!\\u201d So, I ask her if she\\u2019d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there\\u2019s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it\\u2019s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He\\u2019s got hair like Mo from the \\u201cThree Stooges\\u201d but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it\\u2019s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he\\u2019s dead and she\\u2019s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I\\u2019m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there\\u2019s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I\\u2019m wearing my own wedding dress. He\\u2019s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He\\u2019s talking to me about something and I don\\u2019t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we\\u2019re in our bedroom and making love.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Road Trip\\u201d This dream begins with me in a car. My lover is in the backseat and a mutual friend is driving. We\\u2019re about to embark on a road trip. We drive by my kids\\u2019 school first. I want to check and make sure that they both leave and are on their way home to where they will be taken care of. So as we drive by, first I see my son. I wave to him. He waves back and walks in the direction of home. I know he\\u2019ll be fine. Then I see a whole lot of other kids - you know how kids at dismissal time come out in a pack, there may be a few stragglers at first and a few stragglers after the bulk of kids leaving. So we drive slowly. The bulk of kids is gone. I say, \\u201cHang on, I haven\\u2019t seen my daughter yet.\\u201d A few more kids come out of the school, then I see her. I wave and she waves me over. So I get out of the car and walk over right to her. She says, \\u201cMom, I have something you\\u2019ll need.\\u201d She hands me this really long sanitary napkin that has a tail at each end. She says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to need this.\\u201d Then I realize I do need it. But I don't know how to attach it to my body. I go into the school bathroom and I put it inside my underwear. But these tails are so long and I\\u2019m trying to fold them in so they don\\u2019t stick out. I\\u2019m worried it\\u2019s going to travel. It feels uncomfortable and bulky between my legs, and I don\\u2019t like it. However, it needs to collect blood and I feel myself bleeding. I walk back out thes school, give her a hug and she goes in the same direction as my son. I get into the car. Now I\\u2019m uncomfortable and some of the excitement of the road trip has been replaced by the anxiety of this uncomfortable, bulky and insecure thing between my legs. However, I continue on down through the road. The scenery is flat. You can see a lot - miles and miles of flat. There\\u2019s a little bit of steppe at the horizon. We drive for a long period of time until we run out of gas. We pull into a gas station. While my friends are tending to the car, I go into the washroom. I check to make sure that this napkin is still where it\\u2019s supposed to be and it is. I\\u2019m still concerned about these tails. Now I\\u2019m wearing overalls and the back part goes way down past my waist. I look in the mirror and I can see the top bit of my underwear sticking up. I think to myself,\\u201dWow, my underwear is really high today. Or is this going down really low?\\u201d I\\u2019m not really minding that, except that I\\u2019m worried about these tails. So I reach in behind and I tuck them down in again and I want to make sure that no one can see them. I get back into the car and we are driving again. The flat landscape starts to turn into what looks like a town. My friend, the driver, says, \\u201cWe\\u2019re almost at the theatre.\\u201d So we take a few more turns, get deeper into the town with more city scape. It\\u2019s quite old. The architecture, although I\\u2019ve never been there, looks Austrian - like a Hapsburg theatre would\\u2019ve looked like. It\\u2019s beautiful, intricate architecture. We park the car and walk in. The theatre has a giant arched doorway and as soon as you walk in, it\\u2019s got a hush where the soundproofing is perfect - you can\\u2019t hear any of the outside world. We walk down the carpet and we sit in the seats. I can feel the springs are perfectly loaded to absorb some of your body and they\\u2019re all cushioned so you don\\u2019t feel the spring itself. It just feels like you\\u2019re sinking into this hushed luxury. It\\u2019s a play. I don\\u2019t see any of the play in my dream. As soon as it\\u2019s supposed to start - the orchestra hasn\\u2019t even started yet - the dream shifts. The play is over. We\\u2019re instantly back in the car. Now I want them to stop at a gas station again because I need a different way of collecting the blood. They oblige. I don't tell them what for, I just ask them to stop at a certain place. I go in and I collect something that\\u2019s much more suited to my needs, go back into the washroom and get rid of the thing in the compartment designated for this kind of waste material. I put on something a lot more sleek and comfortable for me and securely attached. I get back in the car and we drive back through this same landscape. The driver drops my lover and I off at my door of my house. I go in. My son has fallen asleep in the living room on the couch. My daughter is upstairs in her room. So, my lover and I sit on the other couch. He falls asleep instantly. I have a cat now on my lap and am cat-paralyzed. I think, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s nothing to do here for a moment, so I\\u2019m going to look and see if there\\u2019s anything on tv.\\u201d I look down and there\\u2019s two things that interest me. One is a show about aliens, but history. Another is about this magical realm. The title is in Spanish: Tiende. I choose one of them - I think it\\u2019s the Tiende one - and I turn on the tv and I watch for a little bit. But now I'm getting uncomfortable because I don\\u2019t want to keep sitting still. The cat jumps off my lap. I get up, go back into the washroom, wash myself, and tend to my physical needs. I\\u2019m still bleeding, so I tend to that. I go back to the couch and sit down. My lover stirs a little bit and he reaches for me and pulls me over. We engage in a long deeply passionate but slow kiss. I can feel how sleepy he is and I\\u2019m starting to get tired. So the kiss completes itself with some kind of acknowledgement that there is mutual sleep to follow. I go upstairs. He\\u2019s back asleep on the couch. I get into bed and then wonder if he\\u2019s going to get cold when he wakes up. There\\u2019s no blanket down there. So I go into the spare room, get one of the blankets to cover him with it. When I go back downstairs, he has removed all his clothing. I cover him up. He says to me, in Spanish, now that I have come down with a blanket he has taken his clothes off. He says, \\u201cComo?\\u201d Then he falls back to sleep. I go back upstairs and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Beach Apartment\\u201d This dream starts out after something has happened and I have to go back and do this again, but I\\u2019m resistant to it throughout the whole dream. I\\u2019m having to go back to the beaches around Lake Ontario and I\\u2019m looking for an apartment. The apartment I\\u2019ve heard about belongs to someone who used to be a neighbor three doors down and I knew him from when I lived there before. I\\u2019ve heard that he has a basement apartment for rent. I make an appointment to go look at it and I walk in and am sent by his mother down into the basement. The basement is grungy. Immediately I don\\u2019t like it. It feels dirty and old. The apartment isn\\u2019t even an apartment - it\\u2019s one long room in the basement. The other two rooms have their things in them - for the grandkids. One says Crayon Room and the other room has extra tables and accessories for crayons. I\\u2019m not sure if the owner of the house is the mom or the son. The son\\u2019s got stuff in a third room. These rooms are all around the periphery. The center of the basement is open - not made into anything - and just has the laundry tubs in it, which are the older kind made of cement. He\\u2019s down there. He says, \\u201cSo, what do you think?\\u201d I tell him that it\\u2019s too small, there\\u2019s only one room, I won\\u2019t be able to fit anything other than my bedroom stuff in it and I need a place for my kitchen table and a place to cook. And what if I have other friends over to study? There\\u2019s no place for us to go. It\\u2019s too small. At this point, he seems offended. I get the sense that he wants me to take the basement apartment, not just to be a renter, but he has a crush on me and it bugs me that he has an ulterior motive and it also isn\\u2019t even really a basement apartment. But that doesn't sway my opinion. I have my bag with me at the appointment looking at the basement apartment. The son engages me in conversation after I refused the apartment. He keeps talking and talking and talking and he won\\u2019t stop talking - the kind of talking where there is no pause between sentences. I realize that I\\u2019m going to be late for work. I\\u2019m waiting for him just to pause and take a breath so I can say, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry I have to go. I have a shift that starts in 45 minutes.\\u201d I\\u2019m getting worried because it takes half an hour to get there and I\\u2019m not ready. He keeps talking! Finally my agitation and anxiety about being late for work is enough that I burst in mid-sentence of his and say, \\u201cLook, I have to go, I\\u2019m going to be late for work! Is it okay if I use your washroom? I need to change.\\u201d He says, no! I think, \\u201cWow, he\\u2019s just doing this because he\\u2019s offended I won\\u2019t take the apartment.\\u201d I go back upstairs, say a couple of polite greeting words to the mom, then leave. I\\u2019m walking up the street. The beach area hasn\\u2019t changed much since I lived there. I\\u2019m wondering where I can go to change into my clothes for my shift. I see a place that\\u2019s familiar. I go in that door and it\\u2019s a house that doesn\\u2019t really belong to anyone - you\\u2019re allowed to go in and change. It\\u2019s maybe a public bathroom - there are a few along the beaches where you can just go in and shower and change. I think it must be one of those because it looks like it from the outside, but on the inside it looks like somebody\\u2019s house. I don\\u2019t know the owner. However, I go in, take a shower, quick quick quick. I don\\u2019t wash my hair, I just braid it before I go into the shower, pin it up, go in and wash my body. I come back out, towel off. This is great, it\\u2019s only taken 5 minutes and now I can brush my teeth at the sink and put on my clothes for my shift - just a pair of black jeans and the shirt that belongs to the pub and it has their logo on it. I\\u2019ve got my apron in the bag. Everything I need is there. As I\\u2019m brushing my teeth, then applying just a little eye makeup, two of the other servers, Carol and Anne, come in and are doing the same thing. They\\u2019re using the other mirrors in the bathroom. They\\u2019re quickly fixing themselves up. I realize we\\u2019ll all be driving to the pub together because we\\u2019re working the same shift. There\\u2019s another person in there, she\\u2019s a hostess, doing the same thing getting ready. Now I say to them, \\u201cSo has it been busy recently?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself that we\\u2019re rushing around, scrambling for the shift and I hope I\\u2019m not going to stand around all night. They say, \\u201cYes, it has been super busy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cGood that means I\\u2019ll make lots of money.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that the owner is going to force me to stand at the hostess stand because I haven\\u2019t been there in a while or worked shifts in a couple of years and he\\u2019s like that. But I\\u2019m scheduled for a waitress shift. They say, \\u201cNo, it should be busy enough that you don\\u2019t have to worry about that.\\u201d Then the other person says, \\u201cHey, I\\u2019m the hostess!\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, you applied to be hostess. That\\u2019s the job you agreed to do. I applied to be a waitress. That\\u2019s the job I agreed to do. It\\u2019s not right that he forces waitresses to do hostess shifts on a whim.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking in my head that if he does that, I\\u2019m just going to quit and won\\u2019t let him do that to me. Then, we're at the mirror and I\\u2019m just putting a little eyeliner on and it\\u2019s not working out. Every time I try to run the tiny brush down underneath my bottom eyelashes, it goes on my cheek which is two inches below that. So I have to wet my finger with the water at the tap, wipe my cheek and try again. I do this about three times, then finally decide just to leave it. But I\\u2019ve already got it on the other eye. When I look in the mirror you can't tell anyway, so I think, \\u201cAlright, it doesn\\u2019t matter.\\u201d Now we\\u2019re all putting our makeup in our little bags and any other stuff we\\u2019ve used to get ready. The scene shifts and I\\u2019m in a basement apartment. In front of me at my grandmother\\u2019s dressing table is a tray from a jewelry store with rows of fake velvet that would display tons and tons of rings - like 50 rings on one tray. I look at it and think, \\u201dEw, this jewelry all looks slightly fake. It doesn\\u2019t look like real gold. It looks like some inferior metal that\\u2019s been dipped in fake gold.\\u201d One of the rings has flowers on it and a band. There's another that\\u2019s white. My stepmother comes over and says, \\u201cOh these are all pretty. Which one are you going to wear?\\u201d I wonder if I have to choose one of these just to not offend her. So I pick up the white one and put it on the middle finger of my left hand. I say, \\u201cOh look, it\\u2019s too big.\\u201d I put it back. Then I\\u2019m taking a really long time to look over all the other ones because I don\\u2019t like any of them. I think, \\u201cUgh, which is the least distasteful?\\u201d Then my younger sister appears beside me and says, \\u201cWhy does Freya get one of those and not me?\\u201d I think, \\u201cWow, can I just give them all to her and then she\\u2019ll stop nagging about it. I don\\u2019t even want them anyway.\\u201d Then my grandmother appears - my maternal grandmother. I\\u2019m happy to see her. She\\u2019s past on. In the dream I know she\\u2019s passed on and I\\u2019m really happy to see her. She says, \\u201cCome with me.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say it out loud because she\\u2019s a spirit, but I just know she wants me to. So I get up from the dressing table and I walk with her. The place we're in has lots of people in it. We walk through the dressing area. Now it looks like the dressing area of a theatre. We sit down on a bench with a cushion on the top. I look over at her. There\\u2019s a shower door behind my back - the kind where you slide it open to get in and out of the shower. The door is closed. My grandmother and I are sitting on the bench with our backs to the shower door. Now there are a bunch of men. Some man comes over and says, \\u201cHey\\u201d in an interesting way to my grandmother. I realize she\\u2019s a lot younger. She sits up a little bit taller and says hello. I realize he\\u2019s interested in her. I look at her and think, \\u201cWow, Grandma\\u2019s kind of hot! She\\u2019s younger.\\u201d He asks her for her name. She just looks at him flirtatiously but doesn\\u2019t say. I whisper in her ear: \\u201cCan I tell him your name?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say yes, but I think from her behavior that it\\u2019s okay and she actually wants me to. So I tease her for a moment, \\u201cSo I guess I better not say that your name is Grandma!\\u201d She laughs. I say, \\u201cThis is Jean Renning.\\u201d Then they start talking so I think I\\u2019ll just let her talk and have this moment. I leave. I open the sliding glass door to the shower, but it\\u2019s not the shower. It\\u2019s the entrance back to where I was getting ready with Carol and Anne and the hostess. Carol says to me, \\u201cAre you ready yet? Geez, it\\u2019s taking you forever.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah I'm ready!\\u201d So we exit out the door, get into the car, drive across the lift bridge, onto the highway and into where we all work. I check the schedule. The hostess goes to the hostess stand. I have a good section. The owner gives me a dirty look and I know it\\u2019s because I quit and went to go to some other job for a little while then came back. I think he\\u2019s going to do something to punish me for leaving and then coming back later. Then the night progresses - I\\u2019m taking orders and bringing people pub food and beer. Nothing happens that night and the dream eventually ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Feast\\u201d The dream is strange and hard to articulate. There are moments when I\\u2019m in the dream and moments where I\\u2019m looking down and observing the events of the dream. So it starts with being in a carpool parking lot where you're waiting for others to arrive and you leave your car there, then gather in one car. I\\u2019m standing in the parking lot waiting. The car with two people in it that I\\u2019m supposed to join arrives. I leave my car there and I don\\u2019t see it for the rest of the dream. I know one of the people in the car - my friend, Janice. She\\u2019s a paraplegic. The car has hand controls on the steering wheel. Her chair is behind me in the passenger seat. This car will only fit one other person. The other person is supposed to meet us there. We wait for a little bit and she doesn\\u2019t show up. It\\u2019s Lisa, a person I know but am no longer friends with. After we wait a little bit and decide she must not be coming and just didn't tell us, we leave and we drive down the expansive highway to where we\\u2019re supposed to be going - a wedding reception. At this point, I\\u2019m suddenly elevated above the car and watching it move along the highway. I\\u2019m not so far up that it looks like a dot on the map. Maybe it\\u2019s a birds eye view. I can see the trees. I can see the ground. I can see the roofs of houses - they aren\\u2019t that far down from my vision. So I see the car arrive in the parking lot of where the reception is supposed to be held. Then, I help get the chair out for Janice and she gets in it and we both enter into the wedding reception area. She\\u2019s sitting with different people than I am, so we part at the door. I find my seat. I\\u2019m sitting with this man. His name is James and he is the estranged brother of one of my closest friends, Maggie. He is an intolerant angry negative person. I wonder what he\\u2019s going to do next. There\\u2019s a series of platters of bread that the servers bring out from the kitchen. As they set them on the table, people start passing them to the right. Nobody is eating anything. We\\u2019re just passing these plates. At some point they stop being passed and are set down on the table. I look and the differences between the plates of bread are miniscule. Most of the plates are full of square pieces of bread - square buns. Some are plain. Some are glazed. Some have powdery substance. I wonder why no one is eating them. I take one off the plate. I ask James if he\\u2019s going to eat it and wait for his snarky reply. But he doesn\\u2019t say anything and he just takes one of them, takes a bite and sets it down on his plate. I do the same. I wonder who\\u2019s wedding this is. I look around for signs of who\\u2019s the bride and who\\u2019s the groom. I don\\u2019t like the bread. It tastes like sawdust and I only took a tiny tiny bite and set the rest of it down on my plate. I get up and start to wander around the table. It\\u2019s one long table full of people and there\\u2019s the sense that there\\u2019s other tables around me, but my peripheral vision is clouded. I can\\u2019t tell who\\u2019s sitting where. Then, I rise upwards again. I\\u2019m looking at this whole area from the birds eye view. I\\u2019m not quite clear what I\\u2019m looking for, but am just seeing cars coming and going on the highway. It\\u2019s the same thing every time. After a dream moment of doing that, I drop back down to the table again. This time I\\u2019m standing between Janice and somebody else at their end of the table. I\\u2019m aware that they\\u2019re talking, but I\\u2019m not involved in their conversation.I stand there for a few moments, then walk back to my empty seat at the other end of the table. Now there\\u2019s food on myplate. It\\u2019s an uninteresting selection of meat with gravy and mashed potatoes and carrots. I don\\u2019t eat any of it. I just look at it. I\\u2019m disengaged now from the feast and the people and the festivities. I see one other person I know enter into the reception hall. It\\u2019s a friend I\\u2019ve known for years, his name is Joshua. I go over to talk with him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Praying Mantis\\u201d My friend, Randy, asks me if I want to be part of a housing project that is on an island in the Carribean. I agree. We arrive on the island and he tells me that the house that we are going to build first, the one we can stay in and it\\u2019s not going to be on the land, it will be situated on rocks where the water flows, just off of the land. So we get off the airplane and get into a jeep. We\\u2019re riding in the jeep. One of the people that lives on the island is with us. The scenery is flat and wide and it\\u2019s hot and dusty, arid and dry. We arrive down to where the housing project will begin. True enough, as we get out of the jeep, there\\u2019s land and it\\u2019s slightly marshy and there\\u2019s a dividing line with rocks coming out from underneath the crust of land. There\\u2019s a little bit of water and it flows out from the crust like a very small stream, about 6 inches deep overtop some flat rocks. He says this is where the house will begin. There\\u2019s a number of people that live on the island that are already aware of this project. They are present. So we start to construct the house out of cement. The cement needs to be mixed. It\\u2019s poured and then it hardens. The walls are erected with these 2x4\\u2019s. The men are doing this part and Randy has already asked me previous to landing to design a garden. This is something he doesn\\u2019t know how to do himself, but I\\u2019m good at it. I\\u2019ve agreed. So while the men are doing that part, I\\u2019ve got some large pieces of paper, colored pens, and a geometry or drafting set. I start to sketch out the garden, being careful to also sketch out the house first that is not on the land at all and is not supposed to be touching the land, but is supported by the rocks. The house gets to the point where I can now help with some of the internal construction. I notice I\\u2019m wearing work boots, socks, a pair of cargo shorts, a cotton top and a cotton cap that I\\u2019ve made myself. I\\u2019m doing small construction jobs and am working the saw. We\\u2019re beginning the internal part of the house - a covered kitchen and closets in the rooms. Now there are more people helping. I\\u2019ve finished my garden drawing, colored it in and added some vegetation. At this point, one of the women involved in the project has commented on what I\\u2019m wearing. I\\u2019ve promised to make her a cotton top and cap, and also show her how to work a sewing machine. This is going to be on a next trip because I don\\u2019t have any of these things with me. The sun begins to set. People are passing around some oranges as well as something that looks like beer. I accept some of the food and drink and sit in the lawn chair. Randy has indicated that he wants me to sit in between him and one of the other people that live there. So I do. He starts asking me to share my knowledge of the garden and what I know of finishing houses like this on the inside. As I\\u2019m describing this, I realize that this kind of house and this project is a house that has not been built in this way before. Part of it is that the house is not supposed to be able to be swept away by the water. Also, the water has started to flow over the area around the house - it\\u2019s like a dock, but it\\u2019s not. Although, I\\u2019m also starting to see that there will be small boats that can go up and down using the current of the water. They don\\u2019t have keels. They will be tied up to posts that look like angle irons that have been pounded down around the house and this little bit of deck. The house is really small - it looks like the size of a shipping container. You\\u2019ll get your feet wet when you walk into the house. I wonder how practical this will be for spreading things that are on your feet from the land, onto the deck, into the house. But I see that your feet are clean - they are washed by the water by the time you get into the house. So now the sun has started to set and I\\u2019m getting a little bit cold sitting on the lawn chair. I move to go inside the house. Now I see that Randy has stocked some things to the living room, which is finished to the point that the walls and roof are there. There's a rudimentary shell of a kitchen. He also has a stereo. There is electricity now, which wasn\\u2019t in the original plan. He\\u2019s plugged something in and is playing music. He gets out an album and I notice that it's Led Zeppelin, but it\\u2019s one I\\u2019ve never heard before. I think this is weird because I know all their music. He puts it on and I listen to one side and comment to him, \\u201cOh this song is why you played this side of the album, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d He says, yes. It\\u2019s the only thing I can recognize that sounds like Led Zeppelin - a little bit of the guitar. It sounds like Jimmy Page is playing something, somewhat in his own style, but an instrument I don\\u2019t recognize - guitar like, but not actually guitar. Now it\\u2019s nighttime, our flight is due to go back, the day is over and any work we have left will be completed when we come back next time. So we pack things up and get into the jeep to go back. When I get in the jeep, suddenly Omar is there and he\\u2019s sitting beside me in the jeep. He\\u2019s asking me about what we\\u2019ve done there. I realize that Randy can see him. Randy is acting strange, almost like he\\u2019s somewhat possessive or jealous of me and the relationship that Omar and I have. I think this is odd because we\\u2019re just friends. However, we arrive at the airport and Omar doesn\\u2019t get in the plane. Randy and I do, and we have a conversation on the plane. First he looks at my drawings of the garden. He has some markers - there\\u2019s a bright orange, deep red and brilliant blue. He starts marking up the areas on the drawing. He\\u2019s asking, \\u201cWhat can I grow here?\\u201d I tell him. He uses the red marker for that. Then he asks, \\u201cWhat are some things that will grow in this area?\\u201d I describe the kind of food. He marks those and draws in some things with the orange. Same things with the other area and he draws in those with the brilliant blue. Then he puts the drawing away and. Then he asks me about the conversation I had with the woman. I say, \\u201cYes, I think there\\u2019s potential. I can teach her how to make all this clothing with the sewing machine, but I\\u2019m going to have to buy one to bring down there next time.\\u201d He asks, \\u201cHow are you going to get down there?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, isn\\u2019t that included in my work?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re going to have to pay for your own flight to come back.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s not what we agreed on when I said I\\u2019d be part of this project.\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s acting jealous because of what I noticed in the jeep with Omar. That\\u2019s when I ask him about his behavior with Omar. He doesn\\u2019t reply to me directly. He doesn\\u2019t answer my questions. Now there\\u2019s this strange energy between us and I remain silent. When we get off the plane, there\\u2019s a gap in the dream. Instantly from the airport, I am now suddenly at Omar\\u2019s mother\\u2019s place and there's a summer gathering. It\\u2019s a potluck and a beautiful day out. It\\u2019s lovely to be in the family again. But I know they aren\\u2019t real and I just enjoy the day where it is. Then it disintegrates. I\\u2019m back in the project with Randy. I don't have enough money for the plane ticket and I don\\u2019t feel like I belong in that group anymore. There\\u2019s energy that is not what I thought it was going to be at the beginning. I\\u2019m reflecting on the day. I look down at my hands and I notice that they\\u2019re curled. The fingers are curled towards my wrists and they don\\u2019t look like my hands. Then I see that the relationships I had with the people don\\u2019t seem as authentic as I thought they were. Then I look at my shoulders and my shoulders look narrow and rounded. I think there\\u2019s something about me that looks insectoid. But it shifts and I\\u2019m thinking if I want to go back and finish this project. I\\u2019m torn between the promises I made to the woman who felt genuine to me and the now soured energy that I feel in my relationship with Randy and the project. But I look down at myself and I realize that my body doesn\\u2019t look like mine at all. I look like a praying mantis and I hate myself.\"],[\"\\u201cNothing much of interest\\u201d I\\u2019m in a forest. I\\u2019m walking through. There\\u2019s no one there. The forest is empty even of animals.Every once in a while I come to a door. It looks like a hallway made of trees that just grow straight up and down like pre-planted rows. I knock on the door, but no one is answering and no one is there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Study\\u201d I dreamt I recorded this dream, but I must not have, because my phone is still off. I am a doctor and I\\u2019m working in an institution. I\\u2019ve been called by the people who hired me to do a study. It requires that I spend 30 days in a jail. I have to sleep there. So I move from the medical end of the institution where I work down to the opposite end of the building. As I walk that way, the lighting changes from that bright fluorescent that is often in hospitals to darker. The hallways are poured cement and a brownish dark grey. The walls, floor and ceiling are all made of the same thing. But it\\u2019s wide. I walk down the hallway and I\\u2019m met by some other staff. They take me into the place where I'm supposed to be spending the next 30 days. I dress in scrubs and go into the cell where they are bringing the participants in the study - there are about 6 or 7 of them, and one is a child, about age 7. We\\u2019re all sleeping on a mattress that\\u2019s been thrown down on the floor. I\\u2019m feeling into their dreams and recording them. I feel safer because there is a child on one side. The child belongs to the other person on the other side, so I think this relationship is safe. The 30 days go by and each night I arrange it so that I\\u2019m in between a child and its parent in the study, so I get by. This one woman kept speaking when she was sleeping in what sounded like a foreign language. Every night she would repeat these words and I couldn\\u2019t make out what they were. I thought they were a foreign language, but on the second to last day of the study, I realize she was saying, \\u201cHam and cheese,\\u201d and there was really only one place in the town where they served ham and cheese and it was this restaurant. That\\u2019s why I was supposed to meet my colleague there - we thought it was connected to the restaurant and were trying to decipher what it was these people had in common that would make them commit such a crime. At the end of the 30 days, I describe what I\\u2019ve observed in the study to another staff member, then I change back into my regular clothes and leave. I exit the building, going down the street, and am meeting someone for lunch. It\\u2019s another colleague.But the building where I\\u2019m supposed to meet them, as I approach it looks odd because it\\u2019s daytime but the lights on the sign are out. It looks closed. But as I get about a foot away from the building, I can see that the restaurant is full - I can see the outline of people in it. But I\\u2019m starting to feel a sense of foreboding in my body. As I get closer to the building, I can see that the people who have the table for two closest to the window, their heads are leaning against the inside of the glass and they look dead. I look in through the window and can see into the restaurant and all the patrons are dead. From the marks on their body, it looks like they\\u2019ve been shot and there is a blood splatter on the walls around them. It looks like every single one of them has been shot and it\\u2019s horrible because there\\u2019s a full demographic of people, including babies. I call on my phone and report this. I didn't call the police, though, I called the team of people I\\u2019ve been working for. I also get in touch with my colleague and say, \\u201cCan you please come down here? Something horrible has happened. You have to call the police.\\u201d So I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk, waiting for that to happen. I\\u2019ve moved away from the front window of the restaurant because of the sheer violence and I don\\u2019t want to look at it. I\\u2019m just staying until help arrives. When it does, I start to walk up the street. In front of me is a building that looks like an old turn of the century middle school. There\\u2019s a sign in front that has a wheel, like a mandala with various colors. The colors are all pushpins and they\\u2019ve been placed there by me. I realize this is one of the earlier studies I\\u2019d done. It was a study of lawyers to see how honest they were, how much integrity they had, and how much they treated their clients fairly. I\\u2019m still waiting for my colleague to show up.I think this study was interesting, too, and I wonder how the study has progressed since I left it. The building across the street from the middle school with the sign is the place where I\\u2019d done the research, so I enter into that building. As soon as I\\u2019m in there, I\\u2019m back in the time when I did the research and I\\u2019m still doing it. I get out the stuff for the mandala and the pushpins. Now I\\u2019m recording. There are more lawyers since I first did the study and I\\u2019m making the wheel. Instead of just having the outside of the wheel full of these colors, I\\u2019m adding more data in, so it\\u2019s starting to fill in the inside of the wheel and the radii that extend down towards the center. What I find when I\\u2019m doing this is that most of the lawyers in the study have external traits and they appear to be good, so they\\u2019re getting some of those colors, but the part where they\\u2019re internally oriented to actually being a benevolent person, they\\u2019re not, so they have some of those colors, too. I look and decide that the study is worthless because they have just as many positive traits externally as they do negative traits internally. So, now I don\\u2019t want to add any more of the data and I exit the building and start walking up the street. As I walk up the street, I start to feel like I\\u2019m being chased. I turn around and see two men. They are indeed pointing at me. They start to run. Now I start to run. As I\\u2019m running, I pick up velocity and I start to float up over the top of the street. Now I\\u2019m just slightly above the roofs of the houses. I don\\u2019t want to get that high up. I want to stay in contact with the roofs. So I see one - it\\u2019s not a flat roof, it\\u2019s open and there\\u2019s an upper floor on top of the building. I think that will be a good one to land in because there are places to hide and perhaps they won\\u2019t see me. As I get closer to the roof of the building, I can feel the unsteadiness of not being grounded. I can see that it\\u2019s a workshop with power tools. I think this is good because I\\u2019ll be able to defend myself. I\\u2019m able to pull myself down onto the rooftop. I\\u2019m looking for something that shoots nails in case they see where I\\u2019ve gone and come after me, which they do. I pick up one of these machines and I aim it at the guy, only it\\u2019s empty - there are no nails in it. As I\\u2019m looking around at all these tools, nothing will shoot at them and they\\u2019re still chasing me. I figure there must be a fire escape somewhere so I run to one side of the building and there is. I go down one flight, down another flight, down another flight, and then there\\u2019s a floor and there\\u2019s a woman standing in the kitchen. I lock the door and say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, I\\u2019m being chased. Can you call the police?\\u201d That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Move\\u201d I\\u2019m preparing different areas for a move to somewhere else that doesn\\u2019t have a physical space. It feels like I\\u2019m hopping or transforming into a different time. I first go to a house I lived in where my daughter decided she was going to live with her boyfriend. The house is disheveled - half moved out and half not. I just ask her to sit down for a moment and explain to her where I\\u2019m going and that I\\u2019ll still have a place for her. I\\u2019ve got some of the things she didn\\u2019t take with her and still carry them and will bring them with me so there will always be a place for her to go to - there will be a designated space for her. I\\u2019m going to slide her bed up inside the wall, so I can use the floorspace for something else. When she needs her room, I\\u2019ll just bring her bed out of the wall and place it down on the floor. It won\\u2019t take very long. She seems happy with this, so I give her a hug. Then she leaves. I go down a few steps and cross over into the garage. The garage is bigger than I thought it would be and than I remembered it was. There\\u2019s a really, really long trunk in it. I open it. The rest of the stuff in there has no value to me - I\\u2019m not taking it. But I think, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in that trunk?\\u201d When I open it up, it\\u2019s way bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. There are some antiques in it that belong to my grandparents. I sort a few things out from there. I remove a few things and leave some things. Then I close the trunk and I leave that house. I\\u2019ve got something else to pick up that I\\u2019ve been storing at a farm that belongs to my friend, Rob. I have to drive a different car to get there. Although, In a previous dream I\\u2019ve walked that really long expansive highway before. I\\u2019m not going to walk this time, due to lack of time, so I drive my car. As I get close to the road where Rob lives on the farm, I have to leave the highway and go off onto the farm road. I drive halfway up the road and see a woman I\\u2019ve only met once in person, but I\\u2019m involved in a project with her, electronically. I see her and she comes walking towards me as I pull my car over to the side of the road. I know I\\u2019m not supposed to park in the driveway and I\\u2019ve already arranged with my friend Rob that he will come out and meet me. So, Kem walks over towards the car and we have a conversation about farms, eggs and growing things. Although the conversation is really interesting, I tell her, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I have to leave now.\\u201d So she just says goodbye and walks away. Rob has arrived and he has my grandmother\\u2019s vehicle. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019ve taken care of it for you, but did not have time to switch the tires over. I don\\u2019t have the tools to do that anymore. You\\u2019ll have to take it to the garage up the road.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, thanks for storing it for so long.\\u201c I leave my car on the side of the road and get in my grandmother\\u2019s vehicle. I drive it up to where Rob indicated and as I pull in that parking lot, the mechanic comes out and asks if he can help me. I say, \\u201cYes, I need the tires changed over on my car.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThis is yours?\\u201d And I say, yes. He says, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the kind of car a woman would have. They don\\u2019t know how to take care of these things.\\u201d I feel a bit of umbrage bubble up in my chest, but I don\\u2019t tell him . I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s any point to trying to break through his preconceived notion. Instead, I just get out of the car, pop the hood, and do a couple things to the engine. I get the tires out of the trunk and say, \\u201cAre you able to put these on the rims and change them or not?\\u201d He looks a little bit surprised and says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s all you need?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes. Can you do it or not?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, I can do that.\\u201d So, I\\u2019m waiting. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just going to take me a day. Can you leave it here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I don\\u2019t really trust him, but because Rob says he\\u2019s quite capable, I decide to trust Rob\\u2019s judgment instead and I leave the car there. Now I\\u2019m walking back up the laneway and have some time to think before getting in my own car. I\\u2019m sifting through my mind thinking, \\u201cWhat else do I need to prepare for this move?\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Photo Chest\\u201d I\\u2019m walking across a really long bridge. It feels a little bit cold and windy and as though I\\u2019m walking against the wind and uphill. The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that\\u2019s been empty for a few years. It\\u2019s where my daughter\\u2019s grandparents used to live. They\\u2019ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter\\u2019s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It\\u2019s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It\\u2019s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There\\u2019s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There\\u2019s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It\\u2019s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There\\u2019s one point where I\\u2019m a little bit surprised at Roberta\\u2019s description. They aren\\u2019t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter\\u2019s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There\\u2019s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it\\u2019s her because her face doesn\\u2019t really change. She\\u2019s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I\\u2019d never heard of this woman before. I\\u2019m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn\\u2019t aware of. We just pass the day looking through all these generations of mostly women in the photographs. It was lovely.\"],[\"\\u201cPieces of I.D.\\u201d I\\u2019m in something that feels like the shape of an orchestra pit. It\\u2019s quite crowded with people. A few of the people are sitting in front of drafting boards. The drafting boards take up a lot of room - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019re almost side to side. There are more people than drafting boards, so the excess people make it feel really packed. I feel like I have some kind of amnesia as I sit in front of my drafting board. I don\\u2019t know what I'm supposed to be drawing. So I start to circulate amongst the people. It\\u2019s all hazy. I don\\u2019t know anyone, I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to draw. I\\u2019m approaching some of the people. I\\u2019m climbing over other people that are just sitting there. It\\u2019s literally packed with people. I\\u2019m hearing rather than seeing that some people are involved in a conversation with their drafting board. I realize that even though you can\\u2019t really see what they\\u2019ve drawn, the conversation they are having with it is they are telling it their life story, but there are too many details to draw. So there\\u2019s another kind of media that produces an imprint on the drafting board, the person who is the architect of their life. Then I have some kind of idea of what is supposed to be on mine and I make my way back to it, but then I can\\u2019t remember what I\\u2019m supposed to put on it. I know there\\u2019s a conversation, but I don\\u2019t have enough of an idea of what mine is in order to begin the conversation that will imprint upon my drafting board. So in an effort to discover more detail, I leave the orchestra pit adn I start to walk towards a building. I realize the building is a hospital. I enter in the front door. I decide to get on the elevator and go up. I don\\u2019t press any buttons; the elevator moves on its own accord. It stops at a floor and I get off. It\\u2019s some kind of surgery and recovery floor. I wander around for a bit. There are some nurses and other staff around but I don\\u2019t engage with them. Then I get back on the elevator. This time it goes down. I get off. I didn't find anything that gave me any inspiration either to remember or tell my story. So I wander out the front door. Instead of going back to the pit, I walk through the street. I look to see if there\\u2019s anything that sparks any memory. It\\u2019s an urban street with all kinds of people. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are vendors and street artists drawing. At one point I get tired of walking and so I sit down on a bench. The bench is not parallel to the street. It\\u2019s perpendicular to the street, around the side of the building. I sit there just resting. A man was sitting there the whole time, but I didn\\u2019t see him. Now that my eyes have adjusted, I start to see him. I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll just stay there and be quiet. But he doesn\\u2019t. He starts trying to engage with me and talk with me. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. In fact he seems kind of abrasive and now he\\u2019s in my space. Instead of sitting on his own bench, he\\u2019s now come up beside me. I feel slightly threatened by his presence. I reach into my pockets, make two fists and shove them into my pockets. I feel something in my right hand and it\\u2019s three cards - they feel plastic, like credit cards. I pull them out and I look at them. It\\u2019s my identification. One is a driver's license. One is a bank card. The other one I think is a social insurance card. They have my name on them. My driver\\u2019s license even has a picture of me. I suddenly remember who I am. I\\u2019m afraid the man is going to steal them even though they aren't worth any money. I think he might take my ID. So, I put them back in my pocket. It looks like he hasn\\u2019t seen them, so I\\u2019m thinking this is good. I stand up slowly and walk away. I turn right, trying to remember where I live. I walk up the street. I see with some dismay, my ex-husband. My first instinct is to turn around and go the other way. But I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, he probably knows where I live.\\u201d I decide to tackle this anyway. As I walk through the crowd of people, he recognizes me and looks up. I stop in front of him. But I don\\u2019t want him to know that I can\\u2019t remember where I live. So as I approach and slow my pace, I\\u2019m hoping he\\u2019ll say something to me first. He does. He asks me where I\\u2019m going. I say I\\u2019m heading home. He says, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I wait, hoping he\\u2019ll give me some clue where that is. He doesn\\u2019t say anything. Then he says, \\u201cJust a second. I\\u2019m trying to load up these bags.\\u201d I look down and he\\u2019s got shopping bags. He has a lot of stuff that he\\u2019s trying to put inside of them. It looks to me like he doesn\\u2019t have enough bags. He keeps putting things in, then taking them out, trying to reorganize them in an effort to fit everything. Then he hands me the bags and says, \\u201cCan you do this?\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer, but I just start to organize. Then he wanders off. I'm just organizing his stuff in the bags and I\\u2019m actually making it all fit. It reminds me of packing to go places when we were married and how he would say things didn\\u2019t fit in the car, and I would go and fit it in. It reminded me that I always had to do stuff for him. I\\u2019m slightly irritated that here I am back on the street and trying to find my way home, and here I am waylaid by trying to put his stuff in his bags. Then I focus again on the task. A woman comes up and asks if any of this is for sale. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not mine.\\u201d But as I look at the bags, I see one has some of my stuff in it and am wondering what it is. It\\u2019s CD\\u2019s. So I look at them and wonder why he has all my CD\\u2019s. As I\\u2019m wondering this he arrives and says, \\u201cOh, I see you\\u2019re finished. It all fit. This is good. Let\\u2019s go now. Why don\\u2019t you take that bag? I\\u2019ll take the rest.\\u201d It\\u2019s the one with my own CD\\u2019s in it. I decide to ask him, \\u201cDo you know where these belong?\\u201d and I indicate the bag of CD\\u2019s. He says, yes. I say, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust up the street a couple blocks.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh, good. He knows where I live.\\u201d So I decide that\\u2019s good. Then I ask, \\u201cDo you know where the rest of my purse is? I\\u2019ve only got these three pieces of ID.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s in one of those bags.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Barge\\u201d A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It\\u2019s quite intricate and detailed. I\\u2019m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don\\u2019t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we\\u2019re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I\\u2019ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I\\u2019m just standing there. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m at a really large lake or an ocean. I\\u2019m just watching. I\\u2019m looking at the water. You can\\u2019t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It\\u2019s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It\\u2019s also very balmy and a bit windy. I\\u2019m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It\\u2019s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They\\u2019re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I\\u2019m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I\\u2019m being told that it\\u2019s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it\\u2019s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we\\u2019re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I\\u2019m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I\\u2019m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don\\u2019t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I\\u2019ve been with before. I don\\u2019t try to join them because they\\u2019re in a family grouping. There\\u2019s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don\\u2019t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I\\u2019ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what\\u2019s there. There are muffins. But I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re gluten-free and I know I can\\u2019t eat wheat, so I don\\u2019t get them. There\\u2019s something else on the table. I\\u2019m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she\\u2019s too short and can\\u2019t reach it. I\\u2019m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, \\u201cMy mom said I can have one.\\u201d So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, \\u201cJust a minute, let\\u2019s find your parents.\\u201d She points further up the pier and says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re over there.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t see anybody. She\\u2019s fairly determined and tugging me. We\\u2019re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It\\u2019s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, \\u201cOh look! It\\u2019s garbage day.\\u201d So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It\\u2019s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I\\u2019m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there\\u2019s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it\\u2019s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that\\u2019s on the pier. I think. \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d The post is still standing. I think that\\u2019s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, \\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they\\u2019re supposed to be here. He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see anyone.\\u201d I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there\\u2019s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they\\u2019ve all been in this trauma but she\\u2019s not going to go because she\\u2019s not ready. Now I\\u2019m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I\\u2019m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I\\u2019ve got my laptop with me and I don\\u2019t want to take it. I say to her, \\u201cIs it okay if I leave this in your room?\\u201d She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I\\u2019m getting into a Jeep. It\\u2019s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they\\u2019re all cut out for open air. So I\\u2019m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it\\u2019s cleared out and doesn\\u2019t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There\\u2019s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they\\u2019re with. I don\\u2019t have a \\u201cwhoever I\\u2019m with\\u201d so I don\\u2019t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. You can\\u2019t see the sun overhead, though. There\\u2019s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It\\u2019s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don\\u2019t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven\\u2019t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don\\u2019t know what time we\\u2019re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don\\u2019t see any. At one point the day feels like it\\u2019s gone on. I am hungry but I don\\u2019t have any food. I\\u2019m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren\\u2019t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I\\u2019m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I\\u2019m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they\\u2019re having together and they don\\u2019t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I\\u2019m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I\\u2019m looking for staff to help me. I\\u2019m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I\\u2019m going to miss supper as well. I\\u2019ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a store of some sort. It\\u2019s crowded and dingy and junky. I\\u2019ve paid for something that I don\\u2019t want and it\\u2019s not mine, but I\\u2019ve done it as a favor for someone else. I\\u2019m not begrudging of it either. I am just not particularly fancied with this store. Then I get picked up by two people. I don\\u2019t remember who they are. One of them is the person that I\\u2019ve picked up this thing from the store for. There\\u2019s an exchange of money that goes on. I\\u2019m trying to divide it up evenly - the change. The first time I count it all out and give half to the other person and keep half for myself. I count it and I\\u2019m missing money, so I ask if I can have all the money back. I put it all together and look at it again. There\\u2019s a couple of fives, a ten, and a twenty. I see that the twenty actually should belong to me. I should be keeping that because I paid for the item. The rest of it is divided up evenly between us. This time it works out and I explain why I need to keep the twenty - why it isn\\u2019t part of the change. Now we\\u2019ve arrived at where we\\u2019re supposed to be going. We get out of the car and go in. It's a house down by the lake. But it\\u2019s down by the port, so it\\u2019s one of those turn of the century places that sprung up near there. There\\u2019s stucco on the outside. It could have been an inn on the bottom floor - a place we could go in and get ale and food and then sleep upstairs - that kind of inn. They\\u2019re narrow and tall and stuccoed. The house belongs to somebody. I realize that it\\u2019s the skipper from the sail club. We\\u2019re supposed to eat supper there, stay overnight and then sail the next day. We havent really eaten food in the dream. But the meal seems to be finished. We go down to the water to look at the boat. It\\u2019s half submerged. The material it\\u2019s made out of is all ruined. I\\u2019m looking at it thinking there\\u2019s no way that thing is going to sail. It\\u2019s not seaworthy. The man - the owner of the boat - is describing why it will be seaworthy. I say, \\u201cWell, why don\\u2019t we start by lifting it up out of the water, dumping the water that\\u2019s in it and see if it fills with water again.\\u201d He agrees. We pick it up, turn it over and put it back in the water. He says: \\u201cThere, that should do it.\\u201d I turn around and it\\u2019s almost submerged again - it\\u2019s filled with water to the extent that there\\u2019s only a little bit of the gunnels sticking up out of the water. I have my serious doubts. Plus, the stern is all buckled in. The mast is bent in the middle. He\\u2019s gone back into his house. I look at it a little bit longer. I\\u2019m standing on the pier looking at the other ships moored up there, then just gazing out at the water wishing I could sail, but thinking it\\u2019s not likely going to happen. Then I go back into the house. The man that owns the boat is looking for some of the sheets for the boat. He says, \\u201cThey were right here a while ago.\\u201d I look and see a single bed in front of me. I pull the sheets back and realize there are two sets made out of tin foil - the kind of material an emergency blanket would be made out of. I tell him, \\u201cLook, you must have put both sets on one bed to save storage.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, yes, that was a good idea.\\u201d I peel off the top two, fold them up and give them to him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Seven Centres\\u201d This dream starts at a wedding reception. I\\u2019m there with my daughter and my daughter's boyfriend. The reception probably holds about 50-60 people. The hall is big enough that it doesn\\u2019t feel crowded. There\\u2019s a certain amount of space between people. In fact, we are sitting at our own table. The table is bigger. There are lots of empty chairs. No one else is supposed to be sitting there. There are only three place settings - mine, my daughter\\u2019s and her guest. I\\u2019ve taken some time to do my hair before I go out. I\\u2019m wearing a silver tiara. It\\u2019s not fancy, it just wraps like a headband made of malleable silver wire. I\\u2019m using it to keep the hair from falling in front of my eyes if I tilt my head forward. I also have a multi-strand silver bracelet on my left wrist with tiny stones in it - they are opalesce in appearance. I\\u2019m wearing a light blue dress and it feels really good on my body. We\\u2019re having a conversation at the table. I excuse myself for a moment to use the restroom. On my way to the hall, this man comes up behind me. He\\u2019s fairly boisterous. I don't turn around to look at him. He\\u2019s trying to exert himself into my consciousness. I don\\u2019t want to talk to him. After I come out of the restroom, I see him again. He\\u2019s sitting at a table with some other people. Again, he\\u2019s boisterous and loud, so he\\u2019s distracting. When i return to the table with my daughter and her boyfriend, he comes to sit with us. He\\u2019s trying to sell all of us on this idea that he makes some kind of chart that explores people\\u2019s personalities and lends them insights into themselves. I listen to him for a few minutes then decline his services. However, he leaves his business card. I\\u2019m surprised that it\\u2019s located in Lindsay, a town I\\u2019m familiar with and know that I\\u2019m going to be visiting some time in the future. We finish our meal, the plates are taken away, and we are encouraged to stand up as the staff moves the table away to allow for dancing. We\\u2019re dancing as the same units as the table seating was arranged in. at one point, that same man comes up and just begins dancing. He\\u2019s fairly physical - really getting in my space and standing behind me and pressing his body up against mine and dancing with me. Then he leaves. There\\u2019s a point where the dance just goes on and on. It\\u2019s a lot of shaking, like ecstatic dance. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember the dance ending and us ending up at home in our beds. So when I wake up in the dream, I think, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really strange that we danced ourselves into this non-remembering place. I wonder how we got home?\\u201d We are home. Then I notice that the bracelet I had around my wrist is now in my hair. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a good idea, using it to tie the rest of my hair back so I can dance.\\u201d I go and look at it in the mirror and think, \\u201cOh, it even looks good. I like the way it looks.\\u201d When I leave the bathroom, I walk down the hall and notice that I am in the physical house of my step grandmother. I remember that there\\u2019s something I\\u2019m supposed to do when I\\u2019m here. I need to meet some of the people that were at the wedding reception the previous night. So, I organize myself. I get some breakfast. I have a shower and change my clothes. My daughter and her boyfriend don\\u2019t have to do these errands, so they\\u2019re staying in the living room. They\\u2019re occupied with some other activities. When I leave to go out the front door - it is winter time in the dream - I lock myself out. In order for my step-grandma to know I\\u2019m there and we\\u2019re in the house, I move one of the bricks from the garden and put it at the front door. Then I walk across the street to the neighbor\\u2019s house who is usually always home. They know each other. I knock on the door, she comes out and I tell her what I\\u2019ve done. She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I actually have a key. I\\u2019ll just let you in.\\u201d She walks back across the street with me, we open the door, I make sure it\\u2019s not locked this time, and say goodbye to her. She returns to her own house. I walk up the street. I turn right and I go to visit someone who still lives there. There are a number of family members standing in the driveway, having a conversation. I speak to the matriarch of the family and give her a hug. We have a conversation about what everyone is doing. After this conversation is over, I continue back up the street. There\\u2019s a little girl heading towards me. She\\u2019s only about two. I\\u2019m thinking she should not be out in the winter, she doesn\\u2019t even have a winter coat on. But I turn around and one of the people from the driveway exclaims, \\u201cOh, what are you doing? You\\u2019re supposed to still be in the house!\\u201d I realize it\\u2019s her own daughter. She goes up the street, picks up the little girl and is holding her. She says, \\u201cOh, I remember you. The last time I saw you, I was only 9 and you were with Daren\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh yes, I remember you.\\u201d I call her by name. She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s right. Why don\\u2019t you come in for a visit?\\u201d I agree to do that and tell her that I can only stay for a few minutes. We go into her house. It\\u2019s the house she grew up in and now it belongs to just her. She sets the little girl down, brushes her off and does the mom fingers through her hair thing. The little girl goes off to play. We sit down for a few minutes and she tells me what she\\u2019s doing. As we start to finish this conversation, another woman comes into the house whom I recognize, but I know she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. She\\u2019s lost a lot of weight and her face really looks different. I call her by name and she looks at me puzzled. I tell her who I am. She\\u2019s Daren\\u2019s youngest sister. She says, \\u201cOh, I really don't remember you, but I remember everybody else talking about you.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a bad thing. She just knows me from conversations but doesn\\u2019t remember me visually. We have a conversation. Then I tell her I have to get going and I have these errands to run. She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll walk with you. I\\u2019m going the same direction.\\u201d She tells me where she\\u2019s going and it\\u2019s the same man\\u2019s place with the business card. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, really? I\\u2019m surprised that anyone is interested in this.\\u201d She describes it as being very popular and he\\u2019s well-respected in this area where they all live. I think, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s on the way, maybe I\\u2019ll stop and see where his office is.\\u201d So, we do this. It\\u2019s snowing out. It\\u2019s really nice. I can feel the flakes landing on my face. It\\u2019s so cooling. Everything is just covered with this white magical veil. It\\u2019s just gorgeous. We walk to the end of the street and into this man\\u2019s office. It\\u2019s painted on the door. It looks like one of those 1940 detective show movies with the door with glass on top and name painted on the top like an arc and it has the \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d underneath. So, his name is painted in the shape of a rainbow. \\u201c7 Centres\\u201d is written vertically down and he\\u2019s got a picture of himself there. I\\u2019m laughing to myself because he\\u2019s wearing a turban and looks like a fake fortune teller. But there are other people waiting in line to see him and I\\u2019m astonished that people think this guy knows the future and all these deep secrets about them. I just can\\u2019t believe it. I also note that it\\u2019s progressed from the guy at the wedding reception handing out business cards, jollying it up with everyone, to now wearing a turban. His hair was short and grey. So the idea that he even needs a turban is ludicrous. So now I know where his office is and say goodbye to Daren\\u2019s sister. I carry on for my own errands. I go into a few shops. I\\u2019m just picking up small supplies. I go into a cheese shop and get a little tiny bit of cheese. I go into a meat shop and get a little bit of meat. Then I stop and get a few vegetables and fruit at the market. So I've got two bags in my arms and am walking back through the snow lined streets. There are no cars and nobody else walking. I can hear my feet crunching against the snow. I arrive back at my step-grandmother\\u2019s house. My daughter and her boyfriend are still in the living room. He\\u2019s doing something on a laptop and she\\u2019s doing something on a handheld device. I tell them that they need to come in and help prepare the food. I set it down and notice on the clock that there\\u2019s still two hours before we need to eat. I feel like I want to do something to keep occupied, but I don\\u2019t have anything else with me and it\\u2019s not my house. So, I go into the living room and sit down even though I know they\\u2019re both absorbed by their activities and me sitting there talking with them is not going to be welcomed. However, my daughter says to me, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you tell Joe what your dreams have been and he\\u2019ll record them on his laptop?\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cwhy would I do this? I already have my own dream journal at home?\\u201d But she\\u2019s looking at me the way you try to silently tell someone with your eyes: go, go, do it! So, I\\u2019m like okay, I guess this is meaningful, I\\u2019ll do it. So I say, \\u201cHey, do you want to record one of my dreams?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, sure.\\u201d I tell him this particular dream and I know it's\\u2019 got a number of parts to it. I peak over to see what he\\u2019s writing. He\\u2019s written two paragraphs and they\\u2019re not as detailed as I\\u2019m telling him. What\\u2019s fascinating is there\\u2019s a part on the screen where the words are turning into characters. So, for example, one of the words describing the wedding with the people seated around, but not saying anything are now flying but don\\u2019t have mouths. Some of the words are different colors. I look and I say, \\u201cOh my goodness! This is dream software. It\\u2019s animating my dream story!\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, isn\\u2019t it cool?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, this really is!\\u201d I ask him what it\\u2019s called and he tells me, but I don\\u2019t remember when I woke up. Then, he stops writing and he\\u2019s distracted and patting the cat\\u2019s head. He\\u2019s just recording this a lot more slowly than I can possibly speak. I feel myself getting a little frustrated that I want to get up and move, even though I\\u2019m fascinated by this software, I want to do something else while he\\u2019s not typing. So I get up and go into the kitchen. My daughter says, \\u201cDo you want him to finish or not?\\u201d I feel there\\u2019s an internal cognitive dissonance between wanting to finish and not wanting to sit there for the length of time it takes to do this. While I\\u2019m experiencing this cognitive dissonance, he gets tired of waiting for me to reply, leaves his chair and goes upstairs. Now I\\u2019m in the kitchen and thinking I might as well start prepping the vegetables. While I\\u2019m doing this, the doorbell rings and it\\u2019s this same man though he\\u2019s wearing a turban this time! He comes into the house and sits down in the living room. To my dismay, I see he\\u2019s already got my daughter sucked into his diagram of what he knows about her psyche and what he can predict from it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUgh!\\u201d So I think I should sit down and make sure I hear what he\\u2019s telling her so I can protect her from his lies. As I\\u2019m listening to him, I realize he\\u2019s using some points that have some validation in the world of psychology. I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s what he uses as a hook to get people to believe his ludicrous claims. And then he\\u2019s also using the same colors of the chakras from yoga and saying these are the 7 energetic centres that he works with. So he\\u2019s taken something from academic psychology and some hokey stuff and woven it through the chakras, but made himself the carrier of this information, so people have to pay him and go to his centre in order to receive his wisdom that actually isn\\u2019t even his, but something he\\u2019s whipped up from other people\\u2019s work.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Chandelier\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of building. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m teaching a teacher training, but it\\u2019s really different. The training is to help people connect to and expand their senses so that they have an expanded experience in their daily lives. I\\u2019m really enjoying using plants, food and light in the training. I\\u2019m fascinated by the process, actually. I teach every other weekend. On this particular weekend in May, May 23, I\\u2019m not supposed to be teaching. However, I have been borrowing things to use as equipment and examples - just gathering and borrowing rather than buying things to use in the teaching. This one friend of mine, Thomas has contributed something I can use in the training. He\\u2019s dropping it off athte facility where I teach as opposed to bringing it to my house. So I have to go in on my day off to meet him there. I am surprised that the doors are open and there seems to be another school going on. I\\u2019m just a little surprised because I was expecting it to be empty. But there\\u2019s another training of some sort involving children in one room and this is the room where I normally do my training. So I wait until there\\u2019s a little bit of a break and I wave to the person who is facilitating. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I just go over here and leave some stuff in the cupboard?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s no problem. You can join in if you want to.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you. It\\u2019s my day off. I just want to quickly drop this off and then I\\u2019ll be on my way.\\u201d But Thomas is not there yet. So I end up sitting off to the side and watch what she\\u2019s teaching. I think, \\u201cWow, that's a really different approach. I love the outside the box way she\\u2019s teaching the same old thing to these students.\\u201d I feel this curiosity for and respect for her teaching method. My friend arrives. He\\u2019s got a big cardboard box in his arms and says, \\u201cI need to assemble this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, well, let\\u2019s go into one of the empty rooms so we\\u2019re not bothering anyone else.\\u201d We exit out the backdoor of the first classroom. The next room, which I also expected to be empty wasn\\u2019t. Someone is in there setting up food. It\\u2019s a break room. He sets the cardboard box on the counter that has a sink at it. I say I\\u2019ll be back in a second. I go into the first room that I left because I\\u2019ve left some bags in there. As I'm collecting them, I look out the windows and see that some of the plants I normally use have been crushed. Something has stepped on them. I\\u2019m wanting to preserve them, so I need a bucket or something I can use to dig them up and put them in so I can wash off the roots and put them in fresh soil. I ask the first teacher if she has anything. She says, \\u201cNo, but there might be something in the kitchen.\\u201d So now I\\u2019ve got the plants in my hands. I\\u2019m holding onto them and I can feel how delicate the roots are when they\\u2019re not supported with the soil. There\\u2019s a little bit of urgency for me needing to find a container for them. I go back into the break room. The woman who was setting up has got a really, really big heavy urn, like 3 feet by 2 feet. It\\u2019s some kind of elaborate tea and coffee maker. My friend is helping her set them up instead of assembling what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. She looks like she\\u2019s finished now. Everything is stacked up. I ask her if I can use one of the plastic cups for my plants and I show her that they need some support and I need to put them in soil or they\\u2019re going to die. She says, \\u201cI can\\u2019t give you one of these. They\\u2019re all counted for. If I give you one of these, then someone will have to go without a cup of tea.\\u201d She says that maybe there is something in one of the cupboards. I\\u2019m looking through the cupboards and can\\u2019t find anything yet. I\\u2019m starting to feel like my whole day off is becoming consumed by this task. I ask Thomas if he can expedite putting together what he\\u2019s brought in the cardboard box. He seems to be getting distracted by all the other activities and people. He says, \\u201cOkay, yes. I\\u2019ll assemble it now.\\u201d I go back into the first room and show the facilitator. She is sitting and leaning against the wall while the rest of her students are busy with activities. I show her the plants and ask her if she has a container I can put them in. She reaches underneath, opens one of the cupboard doors and gets a container and gives it to me. Now I\\u2019ve got them in a container, so their leaves won\\u2019t get crushed. But I still don\\u2019t have any soil. At this point, Thomas comes out of the back door and he\\u2019s assembled what he brought. It is 5 feet wide. He\\u2019s holding it at the top kind of like someone would hold a mobile. But it\\u2019s not a mobile. It\\u2019s a light. The light is made of tiny copper wires - they\\u2019re really quite delicate and it\\u2019s beautiful. They expand outwards and then downwards. The downward links of wire are all different lengths. Every 4 or 5 inches there\\u2019s a tiny light. So it\\u2019s a very beautiful, wide light. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to get this home now that it's assembled?\\u201d He\\u2019s carrying it. Then, he asks me what it\\u2019s for. I start explaining to him. I\\u2019m feeling obligated to teach a little of what I\\u2019m using this network of light for in the training. I start telling him. One of my own students who looks like she\\u2019s just woken up from a nap comes out of another room and says, \\u201cOh, did we have school today?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, no, we don\\u2019t.\\u201d Then I see another one coming and she\\u2019s asking if she\\u2019s missed out on any content. I say, \\u201cNo I was just telling Thomas this.\\u201d Then I realize I need to stop. Now it\\u2019s turning into a day\\u2019s teaching and it\\u2019s supposed to be my day off. So I tell them, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019ll cover this next Sunday. Don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d They go back their own way. I tell Thomas, \\u201cI really need to get this home. It\\u2019s almost 3 o\\u2019clock and I want to have some time to myself.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m carrying the little plant in the container. He\\u2019s gingerly carrying the really wide delicate light chandelier. We exit the building and go into the parking lot. He\\u2019s got a motorcycle and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this safely on a motorcycle? I didn\\u2019t realize that was his mode of transportation.\\u201d I say out loud, \\u201cHow are we going to carry this light on the motorcycle?\\u201d He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, it will be fine.\\u201d He puts it along the inside of the passenger seat, which has a curved arm and back. He says, \\u201cYou can just lean against it there.\\u201d I do. I swing my leg over and sit on the passenger seat. Now I\\u2019ve got the plant in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to protect it with my body. I\\u2019m trying not to crush the light. He gets on the motorcycle, starts it up and begins to drive really fast. I\\u2019m having a hard time hanging onto the plant. Now i look down and one of my cats is in my arms. He\\u2019s all tense and he\\u2019s trying to jump off. I\\u2019m terrified that he will because he\\u2019s really wiry and he\\u2019s big and I\\u2019ve got this plant in one hand. I\\u2019m afraid he\\u2019s going to get crushed on the highway. So, Thomas takes one of his hands off the handle of the bike and is also holding onto the cat. I can see the cat\\u2019s claw is cutting into his arm and he\\u2019s bleeding. I ask him, \\u201cCan we please pull over and arrange this so that the cat is being held firmly by someone and everything else is protected?\\u201d He does. I get a better grip of the cat and have the plant under the other arm. He starts the bike up again. I think, \\u201cWow, I hope I can hang onto this and everyone is okay until we get home.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cAlien Lover\\u201d In this dream I find a dish underneath a chair. I take it out of the chair and notice there is a seed in it. I\\u2019m curious to see what the seed is so I give it some water. The seed expands. It happens very quickly. It expands into a baby. The baby stays a baby for perhaps a couple of days, whereas the seed grew into a baby in a couple of minutes. Over the course of the days that it\\u2019s a baby, I notice that it has a fondness for food that is different than people normally give babies. My relatives and in particular, my sister-in-law try to give the baby things they would have given to their own babies. I keep telling them, \\u201cNo, he doesn't like that kind of food.\\u201d They\\u2019re not forcing him to eat food, they just keep offering him this regular baby food. He keeps refusing it. I put the baby into a bed that I\\u2019ve made and swaddle him with what I\\u2019ve got around to wrap him in. The next day he is a boy. It\\u2019s the same thing with the nourishment where my relatives and in particular my sister-in-law offer him what they think a boy should eat. He doesn\\u2019t eat it. But I\\u2019m giving him some different kind of food and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It\\u2019s not even really food. It\\u2019s not plants. It\\u2019s just something I intuitively know he would like, but the rest of my family is not noticing or not recognizing that it\\u2019s food. But it does nourish him and he grows really quickly. I put him to bed that night as a boy. Before he even goes to sleep, I watch him change into a man. I can clearly see his features. His face grows into something that is a bit angular in terms of jaw and chin and nose. He has brown hair, brown eyes, brown eyebrows. He\\u2019s quite tall and thin. Other than looking somewhat elfish of face, he doesn\\u2019t look strange. Anyone would think he is human and no one would know that he\\u2019s really grown out of a petri dish. So he\\u2019s no longer content to stay in the house. He leaves. He just goes out the door. There\\u2019s a regular day in my home. I\\u2019m not leaving the home. I\\u2019m making something out of fabric woven out of a really pretty navy silk that I\\u2019m weaving gold threads through. When I hang it up on the window, the navy part darkens the light so it doesn\\u2019t come through and pierce my eyes, but the gold picks it up, so it sparkles in the daylight without overwhelming. Then the man comes back at some point in a day. He sits. He doesn\\u2019t speak. He never speaks, but I intuitively know what to offer him. He seems content. I offer him to lie down in the bed. So he does, but he doesn\\u2019t sleep. He\\u2019s awake. I\\u2019m not really overly concerned with trying to communicate with him. The way he carries himself, he seems content. He never seems agitated, but he also never smiles. He\\u2019s lying in the bed, but he\\u2019s not sleeping. I can\\u2019t stay awake anymore, so I sleep. I feel at some point in the middle of the night that he\\u2019s hugging me. It feels nice. He just hugs me. When the light comes through the window covering that I\\u2019ve made - the one of navy and gold - I get up and so does he. He gets up and goes somewhere again through the day. I\\u2019m busy with some kind of activity in the house. I\\u2019m not alone in the house. There are a few other of my relatives there. This pattern continues for a number of nights. At one point I feel like we are lovers, but it\\u2019s not really acted out in the dream. It feels very natural and that\\u2019s really all there is - just a lifetime of staying with him.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Time Machine\\u201d This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There\\u2019s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house\\u2019s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it\\u2019s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I\\u2019m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it\\u2019s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, \\u201cI have to take this.\\u201d He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he\\u2019s in the kitchen, although I haven\\u2019t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He\\u2019s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, \\u201cHe left you a gift.\\u201d I feel sad. I also feel like I don\\u2019t want to be alone with her. I\\u2019m starting to wonder how I\\u2019m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I\\u2019m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I\\u2019m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there\\u2019s a really strong emotion. It\\u2019s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that\\u2019s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn\\u2019t appear and I knew it wouldn\\u2019t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I\\u2019m an adult now. I\\u2019m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it\\u2019s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don\\u2019t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I\\u2019m hoping they\\u2019ll still be there when I leave. I\\u2019m glad he still hasn\\u2019t returned to England and I\\u2019ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I\\u2019m confused because I can\\u2019t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it\\u2019s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they\\u2019re in charge: \\u201cDo you know what happened to the classrooms?\\u201d She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, \\u201cDo you know this one is out of date?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, no I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, you\\u2019ll need to go down to the office.\\u201d She tells me the number of the office and says, \\u201cYou need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They\\u2019re just saying hello and stuff and I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren\\u2019s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on asphalt in a really old town. I\\u2019m part of a play. It\\u2019s like a movie set, but it\\u2019s not a movie set, it\\u2019s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I\\u2019ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It\\u2019s white and about 12 inches square - it\\u2019s a cube. They put this in between each word. It\\u2019s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that\\u2019s describing this tells me, \\u201cYes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they\\u2019ve been forgotten.\\u201d He told me the one we\\u2019re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there\\u2019s a picnic table. We\\u2019re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we\\u2019re waiting. It\\u2019s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it\\u2019s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They\\u2019re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn\\u2019t have food, though. He has sewing. I\\u2019m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don\\u2019t even know what it is - I choose that one. I\\u2019m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it\\u2019s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we\\u2019re entering this vehicle. It\\u2019s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but I think it\\u2019s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it\\u2019s got some kind of engine - it\\u2019s not very loud; it\\u2019s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we\\u2019re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,\\u201dWe\\u2019re going out this way.\\u201d I watch them and am thinking, \\u201cOh my god! They\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d They\\u2019re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fun House\\u201d We are at a carnival. It\\u2019s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I\\u2019m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don\\u2019t really want to because I know they aren\\u2019t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they\\u2019re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she\\u2019s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that\\u2019s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I\\u2019ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They\\u2019re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She\\u2019s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it\\u2019s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We\\u2019re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there\\u2019s a door. It brings us into something we\\u2019re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We\\u2019re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don\\u2019t have the shoes on because I\\u2019m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they\\u2019re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn\\u2019t make me put the shoes on. I\\u2019m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she\\u2019s glaring at me, I also retort, \\u201cWould I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.\\u201d I think I said Christian, but I can\\u2019t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she\\u2019s moved back and I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good. Maybe she won\\u2019t bother me anymore.\\u201d On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a window, but it\\u2019s close to the ground - it\\u2019s a crawlspace. She\\u2019s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She\\u2019s looking at something on the other side. I don\\u2019t feel like crawling there. I can see that she\\u2019s jumping up and down. She\\u2019s excited about what she sees, so I\\u2019m content to sit on the other side and wait until she\\u2019s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it\\u2019s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she\\u2019s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It\\u2019s dark. We don\\u2019t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it\\u2019s dissonant. It\\u2019s really unpleasant. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.\\u201d So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it\\u2019s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he\\u2019s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She\\u2019s a naturopath. She\\u2019s there with Trisha. i wonder what they\\u2019re doing because the carnival doesn\\u2019t seem like their thing. I\\u2019m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d Instead of staying on the ground, we\\u2019re suddenly transported upwards a little. I\\u2019d say we\\u2019re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They\\u2019re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they\\u2019re ants and they\\u2019re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He\\u2019s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he\\u2019s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn\\u2019t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Airport\\u201d We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I\\u2019m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I\\u2019ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian\\u2019s house and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we\\u2019ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it\\u2019s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She\\u2019s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn\\u2019t hungry and it\\u2019s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she\\u2019s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she\\u2019s done this in a bowl before she\\u2019s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband\\u2019sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it\\u2019s like glue. Some of it\\u2019s hard and some is still soft. It\\u2019s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don\\u2019t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, \\u201ceww,\\u201d when I\\u2019m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She\\u2019s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, \\u201cWhat time did the tickets say we\\u2019re supposed to be there?\\u201d She says, \\u201c5 o\\u2019clock in the morning.\\u201d But she says it in metric first, but we don\\u2019t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, \\u201cAre you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o\\u2019clock.\\u201d So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o\\u2019clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it\\u2019s almost that time. He\\u2019s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he\\u2019s getting his clothes on and I\\u2019m putting things into the suitcase. We\\u2019re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, \\u201cNope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.\\u201d Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, \\u201cOh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I\\u2019ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We\\u2019ll still be there in lots of time.\\u201d Her husband says no, I don\\u2019t want you to do that. Besides, we\\u2019re just going into the US and you don\\u2019t need passports anymore.\\u201d But I tell them, \\u201cEvery time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.\\u201d He gets out a piece of paper that\\u2019s attached to the back of his driver\\u2019s license. He says, \\u201cHere, read the fine print.\\u201d I read down and it says it\\u2019s fine to go on with just a driver\\u2019s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver\\u2019s license with me. I say, \\u201cBut my son doesn\\u2019t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, \\u201cWell now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.\\u201d But he won\\u2019t let us go. He tells us all it\\u2019s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They\\u2019re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don\\u2019t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn\\u2019t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We\\u2019re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don\\u2019t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I\\u2019m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don\\u2019t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she\\u2019s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re over at Gate such and such.\\u201d So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they\\u2019ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that\\u2019s great, although I\\u2019m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don\\u2019t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Birthday Party\\u201d I\\u2019m at a house and the occasion is my friend\\u2019s birthday. She\\u2019s 50 on this birthday, although I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s her real age. It\\u2019s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don\\u2019t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I\\u2019m looking for someone I know. I\\u2019m reluctant to go into the house. I\\u2019ve arrived there with my son. He\\u2019s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don\\u2019t know. I have an eye on him. He\\u2019s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I\\u2019m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I\\u2019m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn\\u2019t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He\\u2019s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they\\u2019ve seen him. They say, \\u201cYes, he went down that hallway.\\u201d They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He\\u2019s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he\\u2019ll get dressed and I tell him we\\u2019re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he\\u2019s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It\\u2019s not about anything I care to converse about. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are we wearing today\\u201d - flat and doesn\\u2019t feel meaningful. I sit with them for a few minutes and then go back to the washroom where my son is. He\\u2019s dressed now. I take him by the hand and we start walking down the hallway and out. I notice for the whole duration of this dream, my friend\\u2019s husband is in the bathroom. As we\\u2019re leaving her house, I see a pair of plastic shorts. They\\u2019re kind of long - they go almost down to the top of the knee. There\\u2019s a perforated line where you can rip off the last 4 inches and make them into a normal length pair of shorts. For some reason, I pick them up and I do this. I fold at the perforated line and rip off the bottom 4 inches. Then I roll them up and am looking for a bag to put them in. I notice there\\u2019s a tag on them that says Size 10. I think, \\u201cWhose are these?\\u201d Then I\\u2019m looking for my friend to give them to. I look down in my hand and suddenly I also have a birthday card. Now I feel surprised that I appear to have picked up something in her house that doesn\\u2019t belong to me - a pair of transparent plastic shorts - and now I\\u2019m going to give them to her. I don\\u2019t want to because I feel like I haven\\u2019t purchased this fairly; I\\u2019ve just picked them up and taken them. It\\u2019s not even something I would give to her. I\\u2019m looking for a place to set these down. They just disappear out of my hand. Now I\\u2019m with my son on the outside of the house. I take him by the hand and we continue on our walk. We go all the way around the block - it\\u2019s a nice walk. When we come back, there are still all these people I don\\u2019t know. I feel like I don\\u2019t belong there. I\\u2019m relieved to see her husband isn\\u2019t there. She\\u2019s sitting on the porch. I go up to tell her we\\u2019re going and maybe I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow when there aren\\u2019t so many people around. She smiles at me. I smile back. I get in the car with my son and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Curio Shop\\u201d My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I\\u2019m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It\\u2019s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can\\u2019t even see what\\u2019s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don\\u2019t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We\\u2019re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They\\u2019re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we\\u2019ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It\\u2019s purple, but it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s blue. It\\u2019s got fur all over. The fur doesn\\u2019t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there\\u2019s this creature in the store and my son\\u2019s got him. I don\\u2019t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they\\u2019re half off, they\\u2019re still really expensive and I don\\u2019t think I need a spoon that badly. I don\\u2019t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I\\u2019m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s this one.\\u201d I still think it\\u2019s expensive and say I don\\u2019t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my son?\\u201d One of the male shopkeepers says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to follow me.\\u201d So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d and it just bursts out of my body. I\\u2019m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it\\u2019s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I\\u2019m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that\\u2019s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, \\u201cNo way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!\\u201d So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, \\u201cRun! We have to get out of here!\\u201d So we start running. I don\\u2019t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We\\u2019re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can\\u2019t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s go in there. There are other people.\\u201d The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, \\u201cLet\\u2019s change our clothes, \\u201c so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He\\u2019s right there. I tell him, \\u201cYour partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can\\u2019t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.\\u201d He\\u2019s not helpful. In fact, he\\u2019s in league with the other one. So now we\\u2019re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can\\u2019t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got my son! You\\u2019re holding him and I want him back.\\u201d Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, \\u201cFine fine, okay!\\u201d He writes this phone number down. I say, \\u201cA phone number?! Are you kidding me?!\\u201d I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I\\u2019ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I\\u2019m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It\\u2019s a 10-digit number. Now I\\u2019ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It\\u2019s like 164576476470, like that. The 4\\u2019s and 7\\u2019s won\\u2019t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I\\u2019m sobbing and saying, \\u201cJust tell me where he is. Just go get him.\\u201d One of them says he\\u2019s in the basement. \\u201cThe basement of this building?!\\u201d I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m trying to get back into the dream, but I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scaffold\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of childcare setting. I\\u2019ve applied to work there. The dream opens up on what I think is my first day of work. So I walk into a classroom. There are maybe 13 to 15 kids and they look to be around an early school age, like 5 or 6 years old. There are two teachers attending them. As soon as I arrive in the room, they leave. I think, \\u201cWow, way to throw me into this.\\u201d But within a few minutes, another teacher comes in and she introduces herself. She tells me she's there to train me. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good then because that was my understanding.\\u201d She starts describing the curriculum to me and giving me a little bit of information about each child. I\\u2019m taking this in and feeling that sounds familiar, as I\\u2019ve worked in this kind of educational setting before. We start to collect what we\\u2019ve done with the kids up and tell them it\\u2019s time to put their things away and get ready to go outside for outdoor time. The kids start going out the door. There\\u2019s something out in the playground. It\\u2019s really, really large. It\\u2019s large enough that it\\u2019s leaving a shadow on the window of the classroom. I can\\u2019t see how high up it goes. It\\u2019s quite looming. There are some men on it who are working on it, too. It has the feel of one of those scaffolds that construction sites have where you climb up and up and up to work on something at the top. It\\u2019s a safe platform for people as opposed to a ladder, which is not very safe and kind of flimsy. So there are a few men on this and they\\u2019re busy with it. I do note (not in my dream, but after waking), one of the men is black. There are also some plants that are starting to overgrow the bottom of whatever structure this is. They\\u2019re moving from this structure into the building. So while the person who is training me is supervising the playground, I am trying to moveis plant that is starting to grow inside the door of the classroom. It feels really strong in my hands. When I pick it up, it\\u2019s like a vine and fits into the palm of my hand like a rope that\\u2019s about 1 inch in diameter. Every time I try to move it away from the door, it just grows back. I\\u2019m doing this the whole time during playground time. The teacher and kids start to come back in the room now because outdoor time is over. We\\u2019re setting up for the after outdoor time curriculum. I feel that I\\u2019m starting to get sick. So, I get a paper towel from the wall, put it over my mouth and I get sick into it. I notice that the vmit is all blood colored, although it\\u2019s not blood. It\\u2019s like food or something like food. Then I put it in the garbage. I start to do something else, I feel myself getting sick again, so same thing - paper towel off the wall, vomit, put it into the garbage. I go to the sink in the classroom. I wash my hands, I wash my face. I come back to what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I am facilitating an activity at one of the tables. I\\u2019m only doing that for a few minutes when I get sick again. So I\\u2019m trying to hide this now because it\\u2019s my first day on the job and I\\u2019m training. I just want to finish out the day. I\\u2019m not feeling overly sick in my body. It\\u2019s just that this keeps happening. I keep vomiting. I keep throwing the paper towel out and then I\\u2019m fine. So I\\u2019m doing this until there\\u2019s another woman who comes into the room. Now I notice that the classroom has two sides. The other side is completely empty. There is no curriculum going on there, no teachers, no students. When this other woman comes in, she says to me: \\u201cHow are you doing on your first day?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh fine, I\\u2019m completely comfortable with this.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s good because I hired you to run the senior school program in this other side of the building. We\\u2019ve lost our teacher and that\\u2019s really what I had earmarked for you.\\u201d I feel a little bit surprised about this because I thought I was going to be hired to team teach with someone and I was really looking forward to team teaching. But, if that\\u2019s the job, then I\\u2019m not going to turn it down. So I ask her how much longer I have for training. She says, \\u201cAnother week or two. You let me know when you\\u2019re comfortable.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell okay, that\\u2019s good then.\\u201d But as we\\u2019re talking, I feel another urge to be sick. So I take another paper towel off the wall and I\\u2019m 06sick into it. I surreptitiously wipe my mouth and put it in the garbage. I do this several times while she\\u2019s showing me around the empty classroom and describing what she wants to have go on in there. Then she looks at me and says, \\u201cAre you being sick?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, I am.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s interesting. You\\u2019re not the only person who has been sick here. We\\u2019ve lost several teachers to the same thing.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHuh, because to me it seems that every time I touch that plant, \\u201c and I indicate the one that keeps trying to overgrow through the door and into the windows, \\u201cI get sick after. I wasn\\u2019t sick before I got here.\\u201d I wasn't sick before I arrived.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Vegetable Garden\\u201d I\\u2019m in the backyard of the house I grew up in. I\\u2019m maybe about 20 years old, possibly a little bit younger. I\\u2019m with my dad. He\\u2019s teaching me how to grow a6 vegetable garden. The plot is quite large. There\\u2019s room for enough vegetables that will have to be kept over the winter. It will definitely feed maybe 6-8 people for a whole year. It's planned out quite meticulously with companion planting as well as staggered planting so that you don\\u2019t get a bumper crop of the same thing all at once. There\\u2019s corn and cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, rhubarb, and herbs; and marigolds and chrysanthemums around the outside as a natural insecticide. Once it gets planted, which is quite a lengthy process, then we have to go back in and set up structures that will support the things as they grow upwards. There is something that looks like it\\u2019s for tomatoes, but it\\u2019s not in the tomato row. It\\u2019s suspended and there\\u2019s little baskets. I can\\u2019t figure out how it\\u2019s suspended because there\\u2019s nothing above it except sky. Then when I look at it, there are bits of other vegetables in it. I can see that there are pieces of cauliflower, so I\\u2019m puzzling over this. It also spins. There are about four of these on a long bar. I ask my dad what it is. He keeps appearing. Although I\\u2019ve done this all by myself, whenever I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing, my dad just appears for guidance. While I\\u2019m puzzling over this, suddenly he is there again. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this for?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe vegetables on it are composting. The gas they emit is good for the atmosphere that the other vegetables are growing in. It\\u2019s like a Natural Miracle Grower.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh. Hmm, I didn't think methane was good to be near people.\\u201d So I get this garden going. There\\u2019s also another part where I\\u2019m fertilizing or something. It\\u2019s like an extension of the natural compost where I\\u2019m taking some of the pieces from the plants - like when you prune or something starts to grow and the bugs have gotten it and it\\u2019s no good. I\\u2019m grating it up almost like a food processor. I\\u2019m putting it into cheesecloth and leaving the cheesecloth in various places in the garden. At one point my dad comes in and says to me, \\u201cBe careful with this one that no one eats it. It was too close to your body when you broke it down into tiny pieces.\\u201d It\\u2019s almost like I put it through a food processor. But I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019ve got on my body that\\u2019s doing this to it. It\\u2019s some unknown thing. He says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t let people eat this. You have to put it back into the ground. Make sure you put it back in the ground.\\u201d It\\u2019s like it was in my body and my body did the breaking down of it. So now the garden is in a state where I can just wait for things to start producing. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m at some kind of setting that feels like my paternal grandparents\\u2019 party. The house isn\\u2019t there, though. It looks like it geographically. There\\u2019s a building and people live in the building. There\\u2019s an orchard growing lengthwise from the building. Sometimes people plant orchards around the building where they live, but this one extends laterally. There\\u2019s all this empty grass - it\\u2019s like a wild meadow. I\\u2019m inside the building. The woman I\\u2019m speaking with is in charge of the building and the people who live there. She\\u2019s asked me to come and advise on a vegetable garden for her community. I tell her that it's already almost the end of June and there isn\\u2019t enough growing time to plant the kind of garden she wants. She wants one similar to the one I have that is already well underway at my own place. She\\u2019s insisting though. So I have to debate the point and explain it further, because she really doesn\\u2019t understand that by the time September comes or even if the growing season gives her until October, she\\u2019s going to have a whole bunch of plants, but no fruit or vegetables because they don't have enough time to germinate now in this type of weather. I do manage to convince her by saying, \\u201cHowever, this doesn\\u2019t mean there is nothing you can do this year. So what needs to be done is the grass and what you\\u2019ve got growing on the land for the vegetables needs to be removed. It can be aerated - tilled up. And there are a few things you can plant in long rows that have a short germination period. It will help to get everyone we\\u2019re training to be gardeners used to it this year.\\u201d So she agrees to that. So she says, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to get some people to help.\\u201d I see her doing this. Now I\\u2019m standing at a thing you leaned on at a reception counter, but it\\u2019s not. There are people who live there or staff that occasionally come out of a door behind that and then go back in. I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing. It\\u2019s not food service. So she\\u2019s standing behind there and as people come out the door, she\\u2019s asking them if they want to be part of the vegetable garden and they\\u2019re all saying no. I think, \\u201cHmm, this isn\\u2019t going to go very well here in the way she\\u2019s presenting it.\\u201d I leave her to that and step off a bit to the side. There are a couple of other women that have a box. It\\u2019s got wallets in it that look handmade with carvings and are beautifully painted. There are some people, one of which is one of my YTT students. They\\u2019ve ordered wallets and are waiting to pick them up. One of them says to me, \\u201cLook, aren\\u2019t these beautiful?\\u201d She\\u2019s matching it with a matching hat and clothes she has on - indigo blues, pink and white. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s really beautifully color coordinated.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t want to look in the box because I don't have any money and I don\\u2019t need a wallet to carry my money in. I also don\\u2019t want to spend my money on something I don\\u2019t need anyway. I make the comment to the person selling them that they are quite beautiful. Then I move away from that area. I go back to the lady and ask if she has any recruits for the garden. She says, \\u201cNot yet.\\u201d then someone comes out and the woman herself looks really downcast and defeated. I see the first woman, the one who is in charge, and instead of asking her if she wants to be part of this project, she tells her she has to. The person she says this to is every resigned. I think this whole presentation of community gardening is not going to work with this kind of asking without describing what it can do for them, or making it an order. So what I do is just leave the building. I walk to the area that will be used. I\\u2019m using my hands to pull up the grasses in a long straight line. The orchard trees on my left. I\\u2019m backing up with my body as I do this with my hands. One other person comes out - it\\u2019s the person who was ordered. I just allow her to watch as I do this. I do one long row of taking the grasses out. I'm doing it very slowly. The soil feels very fertile. It\\u2019s not hard. I can reach my fingers in and squish the soil. It\\u2019s dark and smells like earth. I know that whatever is grown here will eventually grow really well. I notice as my row is going very well, the other lady has just started and she\\u2019s mimicking what I\\u2019ve done. She\\u2019s doing it on her own and I just allow her to do that. The scene changes and it\\u2019s later. I\\u2019m just gazing at what I\\u2019ve planted. I think it\\u2019s radishes - they do germinate rather quickly. There\\u2019s a long row and they look really good.\"],[\"\\u201cJack\\u201d This is just a snippet. I am with my daughter and some other person that\\u2019s male - I think it might be Kenny - and Jack who is a friend of mine that I\\u2019ve had since elementary school and I still keep in contact with him. We\\u2019re supposed to be picking Jack up because he\\u2019s agreed to help us with something. He keeps not being where he said he would be. So the three of us are running around from spot to spot looking for him. It\\u2019s an urban setting and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are very slushy and it\\u2019s hard to get through. We\\u2019re muddy. As we get to checkpoints where we\\u2019re supposed to meet him, he\\u2019s not there. Now I\\u2019m not with my daughter. I don\\u2019t know what happened to her. In fact, Jack is supposed to be looking after her. It\\u2019s muddy what his responsibilities are and if he\\u2019s actually looking after them. The other two people are going through these convolutedWell, we don\\u2019t have his phone number.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well I do.\\u201d So I get out my cell phone and I look. Someone has changed his last name, but I know it\\u2019s his number because I know where it is in my contacts. When I press his number, what comes up is not his name, but something completely different that starts with D-H-L and then this other name. I think, \\u201cThat\\u2019s odd. How can anybody have done this in my phone?\\u201d Then I look over and I see him, but he looks like he\\u2019s sleeping. He\\u2019s oblivious to his surroundings. As I walk over to say hey what's up, he disappears. Then I go back to the other two people. We\\u2019ve been looking for him because he\\u2019s supposed to be doing something with us. I\\u2019m trying to explain that I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on here and something is going on with my phone and he\\u2019s illusive.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fortune Teller\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It\\u2019s summer. It\\u2019s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It\\u2019s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I\\u2019m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I\\u2019m with some friends. I can\\u2019t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt. She\\u2019s in the boat that I\\u2019m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She\\u2019s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I\\u2019ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who\\u2019s driving the boat is not me. It\\u2019s a motorboat - something I don\\u2019t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I\\u2019m hazy on one that is - it\\u2019s not water skiing, it\\u2019s not floating, I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we\\u2019re staying. I guess I\\u2019m in a motel because it\\u2019s on the ground. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I\\u2019m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It\\u2019s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it\\u2019s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There\\u2019s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it\\u2019s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I\\u2019ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there\\u2019s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They\\u2019ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that\\u2019s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she\\u2019s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she\\u2019s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she\\u2019s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that\\u2019s complete. So they\\u2019re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life\\u2019s purpose. I\\u2019m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I\\u2019m really surprised that she\\u2019s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there\\u2019s somebody ahead of me. I don\\u2019t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don\\u2019t go in with her and I haven\\u2019t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she\\u2019s advertised. I don\\u2019t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She\\u2019s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She\\u2019s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she\\u2019s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they\\u2019re laughing like, \\u201cWow! I can\\u2019t imagine myself doing this!\\u201d Or \\u201cI\\u2019m so surprised at what she said!\\u201d These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They\\u2019re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it\\u2019s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it\\u2019s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren\\u2019t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I\\u2019m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She\\u2019s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It\\u2019s a woman I know. I\\u2019m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life\\u2019s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there\\u2019s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she\\u2019s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives. She says, \\u201cWow I\\u2019ve made $350 doing this.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a \\u201cwho knew?!\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou are making this up?\\u201d She\\u2019s speaking as though she\\u2019s making it up. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGrandpa T\\u201d I\\u2019m in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house on North Shore Blvd. I seem to spend a lot of time there alone, wandering around from room to room. It\\u2019s a really big house. The odd thing is that my grandparents are sleeping in the room I always slept in when I was there and I am sleeping in their room. But this one particular day, I get up in the middle of the night and they\\u2019re still sleeping. I walk down the long hallway into the kitchen. I just sit there. There was never a table in the middle of the kitchen in real life, but there is in my dream. I sit down at it. I feel like there is the presence or essence of other people coming in and out of the kitchen. I\\u2019m just sitting there feeling into them. I notice the dynamic between them in a way I never did when I was a child in that house. I\\u2019m noticing personalities and why they act the way they do. I spend a few hours doing this in the kitchen. Then I get up from the table and go over to see if there is anything on the stove. I make sure all the burners are off. Then I walk down the hallway into the room my grandparents used to sleep in. I get into the bed and lie there for a while awake. As I\\u2019m lying there, my consciousness wanders out the sliding patio doors into the grounds that are around the house. I notice that there\\u2019s a musty smell I\\u2019ve never noticed before. It\\u2019s coming from what would have been the east side of the grounds. There\\u2019s some soggy area - a bit of marsh - that I\\u2019ve also never noticed before. I attribute that to the musty smell. Then my consciousness goes down to the boat house. I feel this mixture of fear at how big it seems to me or that it doesn\\u2019t seem big on the outside, but on the inside it yawns back into the ground. There\\u2019s this big boat in there that doesn\\u2019t seem like it would possibly fit when you look at the boat house from the outside. The discrepancy between what it appears to be on the outside and what it actually houses on the inside is what gives me that little bit of fear. My consciousness comes back around up to the top where there is a greenhouse. I notice that it was barely ever used. There are a few remnants of plant pots and projects that were started and never finished. Then I go over to the sunroom, which is outside, and I sit there. It\\u2019s still nighttime. There\\u2019s the sense of disuse there as well. I also feel like there\\u2019s some leftover bits of gatherings. I think, \\u201cWell, at least this got some use.\\u201d Then as I\\u2019m sending there, I notice my grandfather is beside me, sitting on another chair. He\\u2019s complaining about why it takes my grandmother so long to do everything. I lean over and pat him on the arm the way a parent would. I say, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s because you\\u2019re so picky. If you weren\\u2019t so focused on details all the time, she wouldn\\u2019t take so much time trying to fulfill them for you.\\u201d He sits back in his chair and appears to be thinking about this. He\\u2019s considering it. I leave him there and go back into the house. I go through the living room, through the hallway, and down the stairs to the basement. There are a lot of things piled up in there. I consider that they\\u2019ve never really gotten rid of the stuff that their own kids left behind when they moved out. I\\u2019m thinking and wondering why this is - what sense of something seemed to stop and not move on for them. My feet feel the cold of the floor and notice it\\u2019s marble. I think, \\u201cWow, a lot of the materials used in this house are very expensive.\\u201d The room has a fireplace at one end. I remember as a kid being allowed to create a fire there but there was no arrangement of chairs around it or of it ever being used by people sitting around the fireplace and just gazing at the fire. I feel a little bit sad at how the basement isn\\u2019t a lived in space. It\\u2019s more a storage place for memories that aren\\u2019t really integrated into life. So I go back up the stairs into the living room. I sit in one of the charis and notice that there is a rectangle in the wall. It looks like it has a little door in it and I\\u2019ve never noticed it before. It\\u2019s very tiny - probably about 6x4 inches. I open it up and there\\u2019s a key inside. I\\u2019m sitting there with a key in my hand. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy would somebody go to the trouble of disguising this passageway into the inner walls and not lock it and just leave a key in it?\\u201d The key has some meaning, and I\\u2019m wondering what it is. As I\\u2019m sitting in the chair, my grandmother comes and sits beside me. She says to me, \\u201cYou know one of my favorite things about this chair is?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt opens up to a bed.\\u201d It\\u2019s a single chair. She shows me how you can push it back like a recliner. The part you are leaning on flops out once. The part where your legs are flops out. A person can sleep comfortably there overnight. I say, \\u201cOh, that is a really good idea.\\u201d I tell her that my space is very, very small. I indicate from the end table over to one couch. Then I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s how big my entire living room is.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well that couch pulls out into a bed, too. If you had these two pieces of furniture, you could double the size of your space because then you wouldn\\u2019t need one of your bedrooms.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a really clever idea. Then she walks away down the hall and goes back to the bedroom. I just sit there in the living room. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much of my grandmother is there actually in this space?\\u201d I wonder if she was ever able to use her brilliant mind that I knew her to have beyond the house. In my dream, I feel some anger directed to my grandfather. It\\u2019s like it comes out of my body in a concentrated shot towards him. Then after it does, I feel bad because he\\u2019s a nice man. Then he appears beside me in the chair in the living room that my grandmother was sitting in. I can tell from his demeanor that he\\u2019s not upset with me at all. He has felt my anger, but it\\u2019s not something he\\u2019s ever felt against himself at one point. We sit there in companionable silence. I leave him there and go back to the bedroom and get in bed.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Inner City\\u201d In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It\\u2019s really hot. There\\u2019s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I\\u2019m inside a building. It\\u2019s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I\\u2019m helping people. I don\\u2019t know the people I\\u2019m working with. So I\\u2019m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It\\u2019s really oddly shaped. It\\u2019s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It\\u2019s covered with sticky potato. I think it\\u2019s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there\\u2019s this big hose thing that\\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. It\\u2019s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I\\u2019m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there\\u2019s a sieve thing on it. I\\u2019m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they\\u2019re moving really fast. They\\u2019re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She\\u2019s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I\\u2019m helping. I feel like she\\u2019s centered me out as though I\\u2019m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn\\u2019t up to par. It\\u2019s a whole demeanor like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to watch you even closer.\\u201d She\\u2019s making me nervous now. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I\\u2019m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They\\u2019re trying to speed up and they\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can\\u2019t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There\\u2019s a ramp and there\\u2019s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I\\u2019ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I\\u2019m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don\\u2019t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I\\u2019m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They\\u2019re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She\\u2019s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there\\u2019s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t she put the bigger rock that\\u2019s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?\\u201d Now I notice that she\\u2019s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she\\u2019s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She\\u2019s calling the thigh bone a \\u201cfemoris\\u201d but in a sing-song type voice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cUh, no!\\u201d But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, \\u201cI wonder if they knew she was in there?\\u201d I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We\\u2019re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There\\u2019s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we\\u2019re instructed to sit back into child\\u2019s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It\\u2019s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I\\u2019m stretching and there\\u2019s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don\\u2019t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I\\u2019m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I\\u2019m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I\\u2019m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I\\u2019m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone\\u2019s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I\\u2019m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.\"],[\"Unfortunately, the details have faded a bit, but I don\\u2019t want them to slide completely away. This setting has become recurring now. I\\u2019m in a town and the only reason I go there is to teach at the Yoga Studio. This is the real life part of this dream. There are street vendors outside of the Yoga Studio door. The street is really long. There are all kinds of stores and vendors. I stop after walking a long time. I\\u2019m standing in front of one of the stores and it\\u2019s some kind of curio shop. I talk to three vendors and I\\u2019m not sure if they all own the store or if one of them is friends with the people who own it and they\\u2019re just sitting together and chatting. I chat with them for a bit then enter the store. The store is dark and dusty. It\\u2019s like there is a window somewhere because the lighting is natural, but it\\u2019s as though the light is coming through a really dirty window. So it\\u2019s dim inside, but I know there isn\\u2019t an artificial fluorescent source of light. There are so many things inside and they are stacked in front of the window, so it\\u2019s hard to see. I stand and wait until my eyes adjust a little bit. I\\u2019m trying to see what are all these things. I can\\u2019t really identify anything. They are objects, possibly books, a combination of both. Nothing really stands out as a single object or book. I walk around the store. There\\u2019s a part of me that likes that musty smell of history. Even though I can\\u2019t discern what the things are, I actually like being in this store. I\\u2019m not there to buy anything. I\\u2019m simply curious. I stay in there for a bit. There\\u2019s a feeling of comfort. Eventually, I exit the store. I\\u2019m standing out on the street again. I see some people I know who I have taught at the Yoga Studio. They\\u2019re heading towards the studio. I\\u2019m thinking to myself: \\u201cOh, was I supposed to teach?\\u201d I didn\\u2019t realize the studio had reopened. I enter the studio and people are leaving as though a class has just finished. I\\u2019m noticing that some of them have showered. I think to myself: \\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize we had a shower either.\\u201d It\\u2019s crossing my mind that so much has changed since I taught there. I\\u2019m remembering that I\\u2019ve been here before in a dream, but I was locked out. I\\u2019m feeling this time that I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m not. I have a few conversations with people there - one at the desk, one with someone who is just leaving, and another I can\\u2019t remember. I exit the studio and go back to the street.\"],[\"\\u201cKeep it Small\\u201d There\\u2019s some kind of outdoor grouping. There\\u2019s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I\\u2019m not there to particularly attend. It\\u2019s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I\\u2019m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son\\u2019s friend\\u2019s moms, Melissa. She\\u2019s Noah\\u2019s mom. She\\u2019s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: \\u201cHere are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don\\u2019t react.\\u201d The lecturer doesn\\u2019t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, \\u201cAnd this is how you can keep it out of your face.\\u201d I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn\\u2019t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I\\u2019m asking her: \\u201cAre you buying into this? What do you think?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for some time now.\\u201d She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn\\u2019t had any \\u201caction\\u201d in quite a few months. I say, \\u201cWell, maybe that\\u2019s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you\\u2019re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That\\u2019s a good thing!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She\\u2019s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn\\u2019t anything to be outrageously happy about. I\\u2019m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that\\u2019s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn\\u2019t be able to pull so many people into this. It\\u2019s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it\\u2019s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I\\u2019m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I\\u2019m at home. I\\u2019m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it\\u2019s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I\\u2019m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I\\u2019m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I\\u2019m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I\\u2019ve got orange and blue in there now. I\\u2019m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.\"],[\"\\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d This dream begins with me driving through the town I lived in with my biological mother. I\\u2019m making a circle around the downtown area. I\\u2019ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I\\u2019m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I\\u2019m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I\\u2019m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, \\u201cThere was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I\\u2019ve seen those exact roots.\\u201d When I\\u2019m saying \\u201croots\\u201d I\\u2019m picturing old brick at the bottom that I\\u2019ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn\\u2019t so. I just walk away because I know there\\u2019s no point arguing with somebody who doesn\\u2019t know anything and who\\u2019s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they\\u2019re hungry because we\\u2019ve been walking around and it\\u2019s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I\\u2019m making up something I call \\u201cSurvival Juice.\\u201d I\\u2019ve got these big glass carboys (jugs). I\\u2019m putting a lot of roots into them - some I chop first and some I just stuff down through the hole at the top. It\\u2019s a cloudy light beige color liquid. I simply describe it as \\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d - it\\u2019s a medicinal mixture I\\u2019ve made that is going to help us get through what we\\u2019re going through right now. I hand out a cup of it to each of my kids as well as the people at the restaurant.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bubble Gum Pipe\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room and people I used to work with at a restaurant while at university are gathered in this room. They\\u2019re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They\\u2019re there, too. At first I don\\u2019t notice them because they\\u2019re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we\\u2019re in this other place. They have a baby. I\\u2019m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we\\u2019re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I\\u2019m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I\\u2019m watching the skaters. I\\u2019m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She\\u2019s got a platter in her hands. It\\u2019s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She\\u2019s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It\\u2019s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she\\u2019s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I\\u2019m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don\\u2019t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don\\u2019t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: \\u201cFreya, get over here. I\\u2019ve got one for you.\\u201d So I start to walk closer to her. But I\\u2019m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it\\u2019s warm and there\\u2019s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI heat it up with taffy first.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don\\u2019t want it in my mouth. She says, \\u201cCome on. You\\u2019re coming with us.\\u201d I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, \\u201cMy dad, I need to let him know where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. He\\u2019ll be okay for a bit.\\u201d I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go see my mom and dad.\\u201d We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We\\u2019re almost at her parents\\u2019 place. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He\\u2019s going to be worried about me.\\u201d I look down and say, \\u201cOh we don\\u2019t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can\\u2019t even call him.\\u201d She says to me, \\u201cYour dad was crying when I saw him. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d Then I get more distraught. She says, \\u201cHe knows where my parents live. He\\u2019ll know where to come get you.\\u201d I think that he won\\u2019t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, \\u201cHow did we get all the way over here?!\\u201d Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman\\u2019s house. I think, \\u201cHow is this truck even making it down the side because it\\u2019s so steep?\\u201d It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I\\u2019m not going to get to my dad in time. He\\u2019s going to be gone by the time I get there because this is taking so very long. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Accident\\u201d I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There\\u2019s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There\\u2019s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it\\u2019s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There\\u2019s an image of Ken. He\\u2019s raking or something - he\\u2019s doing something to the land. I feel like I\\u2019ve just finished doing what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There\\u2019s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There\\u2019s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. I\\u2019m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I\\u2019m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it\\u2019s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she\\u2019s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I\\u2019m starting to become aware of the room I\\u2019m in. I can\\u2019t move my body. I feel like I don\\u2019t remember what happened. I see Ken. He\\u2019s in the room. He says, \\u201cYou were in an accident.\\u201d He leaves. I\\u2019m in this room in the hospital. I don\\u2019t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can\\u2019t touch my face. Ken\\u2019s wife says to me: \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay.\\u201d I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can\\u2019t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo. Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.\\u201d The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re so far away I can\\u2019t identify them. I\\u2019m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, why shouldn\\u2019t I be doing this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, this is where you had that accident.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t say anything else. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m supposed to remember something or if I\\u2019m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can\\u2019t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I\\u2019m bobbing around and thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s funny. I don\\u2019t think I know how to swim.\\u201d Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the house. I\\u2019m in a bed. Ken\\u2019s wife is standing over me and says, \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThe water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?\\u201d I feel around my face with my fingers and there\\u2019s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, just rest.\\u201d She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, \\u201cI thought we weren\\u2019t supposed to tell her.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.\\u201d I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There\\u2019s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s about time somebody told me what really happened before.\\u201d This time Ken answers. He says, \\u201cOkay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.\\u201d Then, before I wake up, I\\u2019m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I\\u2019m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Gym\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big gymnasium. It\\u2019s so crowded I can\\u2019t see anything. I can\\u2019t see the floor or the equipment. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in a few hours. I go outside the building to get some air. I notice that I\\u2019m really depressed. I was depressed in the gym. I\\u2019m depressed outside. I feel detached from all the people around me. I don\\u2019t want to be there. The air is dusty and feels dirty. Then my brother swings by to where I\\u2019m standing. He asks if I can help him out for a few minutes. I say, \\u201cWell I have to be back here at 7 to teach.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine. We\\u2019ll be back in plenty of time.\\u201d I get in the car with him. Immediately, it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s driving with this really rash intent to get somewhere really quickly. I feel the car is moving more quickly than is safe. Immediately he goes right onto a 7-lane highway. He races over and we stop at a gas station parking lot and there\\u2019s a trailer. He asks me if I will hook the trailer to the ball and hitch at the back of the car. I say, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I get out of the car. I pick up the end of the trailer with the female end. I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder if I can lift this without him.\\u201d It lifts really easily and I think it\\u2019s odd because it should be heavier than this. As I go to attach it to the male end at the back of the car, I notice both ends are made of plastic and realize that\\u2019s why it felt too light. As I set the female part on top of the male part, there\\u2019s a little cap that\\u2019s not quite big enough to reach over the top of the ball. There\\u2019s no resounding click when it makes contact. There\\u2019s no side pinions that go down through the top to the bottom like there normally would be. Of course, they would have been made of metal, but they\\u2019re not. As I\\u2019m doing this, I\\u2019m picturing the metal one and what the parts and pieces would look like. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no. This is not good.\\u201d I yell into my brother, \\u201cDo you know this is made of plastic?\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes. It will be fine. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I detach and reattach it a couple of times. I tug on it with my hands. I\\u2019m still really dubious about this. He keeps telling me, \\u201cCome on, we have to go.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell okay, he must have done this before because he moves a lot of things with trailers, so I guess I\\u2019m just going to have to trust him.\\u201d I get back in the car. He starts to take off. I notice that the trailer isn\\u2019t attached and I tell him this. He stops and tells me to go back out, pull the trailer back up and reattach it. I\\u2019m still saying, \\u201cThe whole thing is plastic. This isn\\u2019t going to stay on your car when you\\u2019re speeding on the highway.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes it will.\\u201d I get out and do what he asks me to do - pull the trailer back on, pull the flimsy cap back over. I get back in the car and this time it actually says. He zooms on the highway. We pull off on the other side to this industrial air. The dusty dirty air now has grease molecules in it. It smells like petroleum. I stay in the car. He gets out and quickly loads something onto the trailer. He turns the car and trailer around, and sometimes it stays attached. Now it has heavy things in it. But we zoom back to the highway and zoom back to the gym where he drops me off. I have ten minutes before I have to teach. Luckily, the people have started to leave, so there\\u2019s a window before the other people arrive for what I\\u2019m teaching. I see what they have for equipment. I\\u2019m teaching Pilates. I see they have the thicker mats stacked up and the bender balls you squeeze. I tell the people waiting for the class to get a mat and a ball and set themselves up. I have five minutes until class starts. I walk across to the storeroom to see what they\\u2019ve got. I find those rubber resistance bands and gliders for moving planks. I think that\\u2019s good for next time and I\\u2019ll just go with the bender balls and thick mats because it\\u2019s only a half hour class. I go back out. People are set up on their mats. Other people have come in and set up stationary bikes between the mats. I\\u2019m thinking that this is not safe. I look around and there are so many people that I can\\u2019t see who's in charge. I can\\u2019t see the clock, either. I just start my class. I take them into one series of exercises. Everybody is responding super super slowly. The bicycle people keep getting in the way. I look at the clock and my class is over already, but we haven\\u2019t even done anything. This brings that really heavy depressed, pointless, going nowhere dejection back into my body again. The people stack their mats on the side. There\\u2019s no interaction between the students and me. They\\u2019re like zombies. I\\u2019m going back to the storeroom to put the equipment away. There is a mirror and I look at myself. My face was infected with pus on the forehead, under my left eye, on my left cheekbone, and from the top of the left side of my forehead across to the middle. I\\u2019m looking for something to soak up the pus. I can\\u2019t find anything. Then I go back out. This other instructor who normally teaches yoga is trying to teach the people on the stationary bikes to do yoga on top of the bikes. I just wonder what\\u2019s wrong with everything. I don\\u2019t like this environment and don\\u2019t want to be part of it.\"],[\"\\u201cOuiglio and The Dog that Moves Sideways\\u201d I am in a car. I\\u2019ve been given the instruction to drop something off at the house that belongs to a friend of mine who is a bartender in a restaurant. He is a very social person. He\\u2019s very outgoing. He\\u2019s a good dad and has a couple kids. He sells cars and works at the bar a couple shifts a week because he enjoys the people and the contact. He\\u2019s asked me to come to the bar, pick something up, and drop something off at his house. I know where the bar is. I drive that way and meet him there. He gives me a package - it\\u2019s a rectangle, plain, and grey, almost like a cake box from a bakery but more sturdy and heavier. I go back to my car and put it in my car. He tells me the name of his street because in the dream, I\\u2019ve never been to his house. It\\u2019s a really strange flow of vowels and consonants together. He tells me very clearly to go down to the end of the street and turn right at the McDonald\\u2019s. The street runs parallel to the street that McDonald\\u2019s faces. I do this and all that happens is I drive into the parking lot behind the McDonald\\u2019s - it belongs to the McDonald\\u2019s and doesn\\u2019t lead anywhere else. In my confusion, I drive around the area looking for a street with the name, but I can\\u2019t find it. I drive back to the bar. As I\\u2019m parking the car I see another person - Stephanie - she\\u2019s a server but sometimes manages the bar. She has with her a very odd looking dog. She\\u2019s nervous about leaving it alone because she\\u2019s rescued it from somewhere. So she\\u2019s brought it with her to keep it by her side during her shift. She calls it a dog, but it doesn\\u2019t look like a dog. It\\u2019s small like the size of a miniature poodle. It doesn\\u2019t really have poodle hair or even dog hair. It has a thick cotton yarn six-inch long hair or fur or covering. Its face is kind of like a llama. The \\u201cdog\\u201d is in a bag. She takes it out of the bag. I\\u2019m giving her my attention. She\\u2019s excited about this creature. It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s been waiting to adopt it for a long time, but because of its odd habits and strange nervous system, she\\u2019s not supposed to leave it in the house until it adjusts to our climate or world. I say, \\u201cOh wow, I\\u2019m so happy for you.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019ll take it out of the bag and show it to you.\\u201d The dog stands there. Normally dogs will dig in the dirt with their front paws and the dirt flies between their legs and behind them. But its upper body is twisted, so when it digs, its torso and paws bend to a ninety degree angle off to the side. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s really odd.\\u201d She picks the dog back up. I follow her into the bar because I have to talk to my friend about where his house is. I sit there waiting for him not to be busy with customers. She asks me if I\\u2019ll watch the dog in the bag for a moment. I do. I touch the dog and notice the texture of its coat. It\\u2019s like ropes. It\\u2019s very strange. Then I get this energetic flow from the dog. I feel like I\\u2019m suddenly transported to a different perspective. It\\u2019s like all of a sudden I see a quantum field. I see now the driveway and street behind the McDonald\\u2019s was there all along but I missed it because I was looking for something that looked like a street. My friend is still busy with customers and I don\\u2019t talk to him. Stephanie comes back and I give her the dog. I get back in my car and follow the instructions. As I go back behind the McDonald\\u2019s, I see the street. I wonder why I didn\\u2019t notice it before. I turn down the street, find his house, drop off the package, get back in the car and find my way back home.\"],[\"\\u201cPhoto Albums\\u201d This dream doesn\\u2019t have a lot of pattern to it. It\\u2019s mostly scenes, like a photo album. I am at Omar\\u2019s mother\\u2019s house. His mom\\u2019s family is there. His brother is there. His daughter is there. There are other random people. There\\u2019s an idea that we need to go somewhere, but I don\\u2019t really understand what it is. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m sitting in the living room and I feel Omar\\u2019s present. I can see him, but no one else seems to know he\\u2019s there. He tells me to get out my photo album and show it to his daughter. She\\u2019s curious about what he was like as a teenager and a young man. My photo album from my house appears in my hands. I open it up and start to show her different pictures. She\\u2019s much older now than he is in the album. She comments about how young he looks. As I turn the pages, she says, \\u201cOh I didn\\u2019t realize my dad could do that.\\u201d We get into some conversations about things that he did when he was young. That\\u2019s all I remember.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Television Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house of my daughter\\u2019s grandparents, both of whom have crossed over. The house doesn\\u2019t look exactly like the house they used to live in, but I know it\\u2019s their house. I\\u2019m in it and I can feel the air has a different quality - it\\u2019s light and has particles in it, it\\u2019s as though I am standing in front of a window and can see light streaming in with particles floating in it. It\\u2019s so light and bright. The house is empty but it feels like there\\u2019s a presence in the light. Gradually Roberta and Tom appear. They look just like they did when I met them. Tom is busy with a project. He\\u2019s making something outside - he\\u2019s building something. Roberta is inside. She\\u2019s putting something together with her hands. One of her daughters appears and she\\u2019s laughing and joking. She\\u2019s, in a loving way, mocking what her mom is doing. Then they ask me if I would be involved with this project. I ask what it is that they\\u2019re doing. They say they\\u2019re creating hairstyles for people that are going to be on the television show. I realize that there\\u2019s a producer involved that\\u2019s giving some of the instructions, but I can\\u2019t see him and they\\u2019re just making reference to him. Roberta and Tom have a lot of autonomy. Someone is just doing the filming. I agree to do part of the hairstyles. They\\u2019re putting the styles together on paper first, but not as a drawing - it\\u2019s a standout relief like you\\u2019d make a sculpture - only they\\u2019re doing it with bits and pieces of things to create a finished product that is a hairstyle. There are all kinds of stuff woven into the hairstyles as if it\\u2019s been upcycled out of bits of ribbon, yarn and human hair. It\\u2019s colorful and unique in a way that I\\u2019ve never thought of before. It\\u2019s actually coming out more like a headdress which makes sense because they are Native North American. Then Tom comes in from outside and he\\u2019s washing his hands because he\\u2019s been making some kind of vehicle, some kind of car. I don\\u2019t see what he\\u2019s doing, though. He says he\\u2019s about finished and his part is ready to go. We say that we\\u2019re ready to do the headdress. We share a meal and then the producer comes and films Tom\\u2019s part outside first. Someone else is following the prototype headdresses we created and implementing it. We\\u2019re returning the camaraderie, laughing and joking. At one point, Roberta is saying something to me and her daughter is standing right behind me and making remarks like, \\u201cOh sure sure,\\u201d really close to my ear. Roberta says, \\u201cWhat are you saying?\\u201d Her daughter won\\u2019t repeat it. I think that I don\\u2019t like being a vessel for this. Then the producer comes in and asks us if we would like to preview the movie. Everybody says yes. We go to the living room and the lights are dimmed somehow - this is weird because there are no lights in the house, only the heavily particled lightness. But it does dim so we can see a movie projected onto the wall. The opening credits go up showing the background parts that everyone did - creative direction, innovation, etc.. Then, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a screen that comes up with Tom\\u2019s car. I realize the movie is about the making of it. I\\u2019m astonished at the innovation that has been put into this vehicle. It\\u2019s similar to the headdresses we developed. His vehicle is made out of so many different things. It doesn\\u2019t look junky, though, it looks really sophisticated, polished and well integrated. In fact, you wouldn\\u2019t even know it\\u2019s a vehicle when you first look at it. There are so many different things in it. It definitely looks metal, but when you look, you can see pieces that form the finished metal but aren\\u2019t metal. They\\u2019ve got this upcycled feel to it, but in a highly sophisticated and finished product.\"],[\"\\u201cThe ATM\\u201d I\\u2019m in a lineup in the bank. My son is with me. I\\u2019ve got cash and gift cards to deposit. I\\u2019m twelfth in line and when I get to be second in line, I start to organize my piles of cash and gift cards. I realize that I cannot find my bank card, although I know it\\u2019s in my purse. So I\\u2019m disorganized and have too many things in my hands and there is too much stuff in my wallet that is not a bank card. As I\\u2019m trying to juggle all these different piles of things, I now become the first person in line and it\\u2019s my turn. I still can\\u2019t find my bank card. I say to the couple behind me - a man and a woman who appear to know each other and have been chatting happily the whole time - \\u201cI need to set my stuff down on the floor. I can\\u2019t find my bank card. I know it\\u2019s here. Feel free to go ahead.\\u201d They do and I can still hear them chatting happily with each other. I\\u2019ve spread everything out on the floor and sort through them. I\\u2019ve got envelopes opened with bills I\\u2019ve looked at and returned. There are things from my son\\u2019s birthday party. There are gift cards for McDonald\\u2019s that I know we\\u2019ll never use because we don\\u2019t eat there, but we can deposit them into our bank account. I finally locate my bank card. Every time I thought I located my bank card, I would look at it and it was a replica of a bank card but wasn\\u2019t a bank card. It keeps getting into the pile of things to deposit into the ATM by accident because it looks so much like a bank card but it\\u2019s not one. Although when I\\u2019m finally read to make my deposit, the couple that was chatting happily has gone and there are different people who are ready to have their turn. I walk up with my son and say to the person who\\u2019s next: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been looking for my bank card and have already been waiting in this line. Is it okay if I go next?\\u201d They\\u2019re quite happy to let me go. I get there and the screen is like an electronic game board - like \\u201cSnakes and Ladders\\u201d or \\u201cGame of Life\\u201d or \\u201cMouse Trap\\u201d or one of those really colorful game boards for kids with lights and red, green and yellow. I try to put my bank card in and realize it\\u2019s this dummy bank card again. I pull it out and am trying to sift through. I have different deposits in between each finger and thumb as if my hand is a categorized sorter. I know I\\u2019m taking a really long time. The bank machine spits out the pseudo bank card. I ask my son if he\\u2019ll hold a couple things. I\\u2019m still trying to get the bank card. I turn around and explain to the person behind me: \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. The machine keeps rejecting my card.\\u201d Then, I locate the real bank card and put it in. Now it\\u2019s asking me to select from one of the buttons underneath if I want to deposit gift cards. The button is really tiny. There are three buttons you can press and they\\u2019re all really close together. I keep trying to push the one button. Finally it works. Every time you push a button, a whole bunch of other things light up on this screen. There are pictures of circus people and they aren\\u2019t just pictures, they\\u2019re animated parts that are moving. I get the gift card thing to work and insert them one at a time. On the screen, which is quite large - probably 12x12 - it\\u2019s like a record of your deposits and says exactly what you deposited and how much the gift card was worth. So I\\u2019m feeding four gift cards in. Then it tells me what bills I need to pay. I had the bills all organized. You have to push each bill into the machine to pay your bills. I think I\\u2019m almost done when the bank teller comes out with three big boxes of past records of bill payments. I\\u2019m unprepared to deal with all of this. I finish my transaction and allow the ATM to return my card so someone else can have their turn. I thank the person behind me for waiting patiently. Then I look at what's in these boxes. It is my whole life, everywhere I\\u2019ve lived, as if the bank has kept records of this and it\\u2019s all in the boxes and sorted sequentially in years and months in a proper sorting job. All of these envelopes have been opened with transaction receipts that are on letterhead folded in threes and put back in the envelope and sorted chronologically. It goes all the way back through every relationship I\\u2019ve ever had prior to my daughter\\u2019s birth with all the different houses I\\u2019ve lived in, everywhere I\\u2019ve traveled. I think that I\\u2019ve taken care of this. I\\u2019ve paid my taxes. I didn\\u2019t even know there were records that this stuff existed. I decide to just shred them and not even attempt to go through all these boxes and take everything out to look at it. I\\u2019m done with that. I\\u2019m good. I pick the boxes up. I walk around the giant line of people waiting for the ATM. I notice the material of the floors and walls. I notice the architecture of the building. Everything is made of marble. Feet click on the marble. It\\u2019s very ostentatious, yet it is quite simple. I guess it\\u2019s like an expensive institution style architecture without a lot of external trappings; it\\u2019s all straight and linear, boxed. The ceiling, however, is really high. I\\u2019m standing at the teller waiting to say that these things need to be shredded. I see the woman who was part of the couple chatting happily. She\\u2019s telling one of the tellers that now there is a hot studio on the top floor of this building. She\\u2019s pretty happy about this and she\\u2019s going to go up there and try it. I think to myself, \\u201cWow, that seems odd that there would be a hot yoga studio on the twelfth floor of a bank institution.\\u201d I watch her go upstairs. She\\u2019s dressed really colorfully. She\\u2019s wearing a tan mini skirt and bright pink jacket that almost meets the hem of the mini skirt. I watch her walk up the stairs. The teller takes my boxes. I say, \\u201cPlease just shred these.\\u201d Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cHigh School, Again\\u201d The dream starts off and I\\u2019m in something that looks like a school. It\\u2019s quite a big building with a couple floors and has the feel of a high school. There are lockers lining the hallways. It\\u2019s the expanded version of high school but doesn\\u2019t look like the one I went to - it just represents high school. In one of the rooms, there are four large round tables, but they\\u2019re really low to the floor like you\\u2019d see in a daycare. There are chairs around the tables. There\\u2019s a bathtub with a shower curtain pulled across it on one side. Across the hall from this room - and the hall is lined with lockers - is a doorway that leads into my apartment. All I see of my apartment is just the one room you enter. So as you open the door, it goes into a living area. There is some living room furniture like a couch and a couple other chairs for single people, some end tables and lamps. There\\u2019s a closet with a cheap sliding door where coats are hung. It does look like there\\u2019s a kitchen off to the right although I do not enter it in my dream. In my dream I leave my apartment, walk across the hall and see that people are starting to gather around the tables. I see a couple friends from high school. I\\u2019m still friends with one of them even though she\\u2019s moved quite a distance away. It doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s been a long time because we do message on Facebook. She stands up and I give her a hug. Then we both sit down at the table. I\\u2019m having trouble fitting my adult size body under the table - my knees don\\u2019t fit under because the table and chairs are so low. I kind of sit sideways to the table and rest my elbows on the top. Then I see another person that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. She moved right out of high school and she and her husband live out west. I\\u2019m really happy to see her and give her a big hug. She says, \\u201cOh my goodness, that was a really strong hug.\\u201d She\\u2019s laughing and I\\u2019m laughing, too. I tell her that I\\u2019ve been working out and my arms are strong. There\\u2019s some kind of job that I\\u2019m to start in February that requires upper body strength. I say, \\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t always been like this, but I really wanted the job. So in November I started lifting weights with my arms. Good thing it\\u2019s only December! If this were February, I might have squeezed you harder!\\u201d She laughs. We sit down at the table. Again, it\\u2019s hard for me to get my legs under, so I sit sideways with my elbows on the table. Other people join us. We\\u2019ve taken out our lunch and are eating a little and chatting with light-hearted humor. I notice behind me that there\\u2019s a different group of people starting to assemble at the other round table. I notice Lisa - the friend who betrayed our friendship. She also betrayed her own brother\\u2019s wife. It\\u2019s the brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends that are starting to gather at the table behind me. I\\u2019m aware of this out of my peripheral vision. Then I need to go into the washroom, so I excuse myself and get up from the table. I go to the bathtub with shower curtain. I\\u2019m not having a shower. I don\\u2019t remember using the toilet or sink. I just go in and pull the shower curtain across. I\\u2019m in there for a few minutes then come out again. Now I see that Lisa is sitting at the table with her brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends. They all have stony looks on their faces. She has her arms folded over her chest. I think, \\u201cUgh, why is she even sitting there? I wonder what\\u2019s going on with that. They look so awkward and agitated.\\u201d But I\\u2019m glad she didn\\u2019t sit down with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I\\u2019m hoping as I walk back to my table that she won\\u2019t look at me. She doesn\\u2019t, which is good, and I sit back down with my friends. Then, we\\u2019re finishing our lunch and it\\u2019s time to go somewhere else. Everyone else in the room has cleared, including Lisa. There\\u2019s only one person left at the table where I was sitting and I\\u2019m wanting to clean it up. There are rolls of paper towels which actually look like toilet paper rolls. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s a good idea to cut paper towel rolls in half because people only normally need a little bit anyway.\\u201d I remove a couple pieces and wipe up the table. Then I take the rest of the paper towel which is now opened. I set it in front of my apartment door. I\\u2019m tidying up and putting everything away. At this point, a few people start coming back into the room. It\\u2019s all clean and lunch has been put away. Somebody says, \\u201cWhere are all the paper towels?\\u201d As I\\u2019m about to indicate that I\\u2019ve put everything away, there\\u2019s a rumor flying around the room. The rumor is an embodiment of itself where it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s more than one voice talking at once. I can hear phrases like, \\u201cWho would take all the paper towels? Why are there no paper towels? Has anyone reported this?\\u201d I think, \\u201cWh? Was there supposed to be a lot of paper towels in here?\\u201d I\\u2019m about to indicate that there were no other paper towels in here and I have a roll right there, but all these rumors with false information got together and now there were supposed to have been three boxes of paper towels lined up against the wall and they\\u2019re all missing. The janitor is going to be upset. I say to someone, \\u201cWell why doesn\\u2019t someone ask the janitor if there\\u2019s supposed to be three boxes here? Ask where they\\u2019re supposed to be kept. There\\u2019s no point getting all upset about this.\\u201d Then I point with my finger and say, \\u201cLook! There\\u2019s a partial half roll right there. Let\\u2019s use that for what we need and then go and retrace the steps of where these have all gone.\\u201d Nobody is listening. Then I see Lisa look at it. She\\u2019s adding to the rumor that I\\u2019ve stolen all the paper towels. I\\u2019m trying to explain to people that I just cleaned up and wiped up all the tables. I put the half roll in front of the door because I didn't know where it went and didn\\u2019t want to leave it on the center of the table. No one is really focused on any one certain thing and no one is asking the janitor where they\\u2019re supposed to be or if in fact any are missing at all. Maybe he hasn\\u2019t brought them up for the day.\"],[\"\\u201cGrapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water\\u201d This dream starts in my house. It\\u2019s not the house I currently live in; it\\u2019s not a house I\\u2019m familiar with at all. I\\u2019m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we\\u2019ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It\\u2019s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It\\u2019s beautiful. It\\u2019s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don\\u2019t say anything. We\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cYep, this is going to be good.\\u201d We go in. There\\u2019s an older woman who is taking people\\u2019s names. She\\u2019s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it\\u2019s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person\\u2019s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it\\u2019s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people\\u2019s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We\\u2019re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she\\u2019s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it\\u2019s like a black walnut dark. It\\u2019s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people\\u2019s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It\\u2019s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re standing on. I realize what they\\u2019re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life - they\\u2019re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it\\u2019s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I\\u2019m on a rollercoaster, but it\\u2019s moving through the church. I can see the track that it\\u2019s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there\\u2019s no track after that and we\\u2019re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don\\u2019t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It\\u2019s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That\\u2019s where everybody is going. So we\\u2019re new and we follow the crowd. It\\u2019s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I\\u2019ll slide backwards, but I don\\u2019t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there\\u2019s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there\\u2019s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It\\u2019s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I\\u2019m sitting in, I realize it\\u2019s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it\\u2019s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We\\u2019re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it\\u2019s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I\\u2019m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I\\u2019ve noticed that we\\u2019re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We\\u2019ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it\\u2019s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we\\u2019re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn\\u2019t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: \\u201cHave we contributed to this in some way?\\u201d So there\\u2019s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we\\u2019re just supposed to help make it or if we\\u2019ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there\\u2019s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I\\u2019m asking her if she knows where we\\u2019re supposed to be at what time. She says, \\u201cOh yes, I still have that information, it\\u2019s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven\\u2019t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you\\u2019d be back.\\u201d That\\u2019s just a memory. Then the people we\\u2019re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We\\u2019ve walked down this path from the church - it\\u2019s a dirt path that\\u2019s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren\\u2019t in an urban area. It\\u2019s like non-urbanized, but we\\u2019re not in the woods because there\\u2019s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can\\u2019t see what they are. It\\u2019s not just a dock, it\\u2019s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we\\u2019ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I\\u2019ve recently noted that he\\u2019s involved in this conspiracy group and they\\u2019re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He\\u2019s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it\\u2019s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we\\u2019re with take the cloth off the boat. I\\u2019m happy to see it\\u2019s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: \\u201cYou know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI do, but it\\u2019s not mine. Whose boat is it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn\\u2019t here and this other person who I don\\u2019t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it\\u2019s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I\\u2019m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I\\u2019m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it\\u2019s okay. He says, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It\\u2019s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I\\u2019ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I\\u2019m checking out the rigging.There\\u2019s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They\\u2019re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it\\u2019s a weird place to have this because normally they\\u2019re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can\\u2019t see what the operate. I\\u2019m trying to figure this out. The ship\\u2019s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I\\u2019m looking at it I\\u2019m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I\\u2019m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they\\u2019re not even ships at all, but they\\u2019re bobbing up and down so they\\u2019re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I\\u2019m off the boat of the woman who I didn\\u2019t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that\\u2019s okay because I didn\\u2019t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don\\u2019t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he\\u2019s not there. So I text him and ask him if he\\u2019s going to be sailing today. He says, \\u201cYes. Just wait there and I\\u2019ll be down at my boat in a moment.\\u201d My daughter and I wait. We\\u2019re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We\\u2019re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, \\u201cOkay, are you guys ready to go?\\u201d We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it\\u2019s right up against the dock and as we look in, it\\u2019s so deep that it\\u2019s black - you can\\u2019t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it\\u2019s so long I can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s enormous. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Radio Show\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really interesting old house here. It\\u2019s semi-dark, too - it\\u2019s like the air has that kind of presence to it where the molecules have some kind of sentience. You can feel the energy in the air. It feels compassionate. So it\\u2019s also not very light. The windows, although they\\u2019re big, don\\u2019t seem to transmit an awful lot of light, so that casts a little bit of a shadowy effect over everything in the house. I\\u2019m aware that there is a floor above me, but I don't go into it in my dream. The ceilings are really high. The windows are deep and wide. It feels like mid-eighteenth century architecture of someone who would have had enough money to build a fair-sized house. I guess you would call the parlor, because it\\u2019s off the kitchen, has a big archway that goes into the sitting room. I can see the sitting room and kitchen from the parlor, but I stay in the parlor which has a big couch with deep cushions in it and a turkish rug that\\u2019s woven and quite colorful in muted tones. There\\u2019s electronic equipment against one of the walls. I\\u2019m there because I\\u2019m supposed to be recording some kind of radio show. In order to add my segment, I have to walk over to the electronic equipment - it\\u2019s got dials on it - and I\\u2019m moving the dials around watching the needle on the screen move up and down as I turn the dial. I\\u2019m trying to get it centered in the screen so I have a signal. Once I get the needle centered, I can hear the radio show that\\u2019s in progress. When I hear a certain tone, I\\u2019m supposed to start talking. I have brought with me what looks like an iPod, but it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s some kind of device that adds music that will be a bridge. I have to fade in the music, let it play for a few seconds, then fade the music out, then I\\u2019m to say what I\\u2019m supposed to say. My segment is 30 minutes. So I do this. I am waiting for the tone and I hear the tone. Somebody else\\u2019s music enters the feed. I can hear it, but when I try to center the dials to add my section, that music won\\u2019t go away. I think, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just sit here and wait the half hour that my segment is supposed to be and if the music keeps playing, then I\\u2019ll just leave after the half hour is over. I\\u2019m waiting. Twenty-three minutes pass and I know there\\u2019s only seven minutes left. I think it\\u2019s almost going to be time for me to go when someone else comes in the room. She says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re not adding your part.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, there\\u2019s this strange music that isn\\u2019t responding to any of the dials.\\u201d So she goes over and starts moving the dials around. She\\u2019s trying to fix it. Her girlfriend comes into the room and sits down on the floor and waits. She spends the next seven minutes fiddling with it. Then the time is up. I just tell them I\\u2019m going to go. They ask, \\u201cCan you come back and try again tomorrow at the same time?\\u201d I consider this for a minute wondering if i want to keep just coming back here and waiting for nothing to happen. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try and come back one more time tomorrow.\\u201d Then, I\\u2019ve got this pack that goes across one shoulder, across my body and sits on my hip. I reach into it and grab two round discs about the size of a Canadian toonie. But they\\u2019re not toonies. They\\u2019re bumpy, thin and made of a condensed grain of some sort. I\\u2019m thinking that if you put them in water, they\\u2019ll swell up. I hand one of them to her. I close up the flat. As I turn around I notice one of my students is there. He walks with me as I go out the door. I walk down the porch and all of a sudden, it\\u2019s a lot lighter outside, but the sun isn\\u2019t shining; it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s less darkness. Het disappears - I guess he walks somewhere else. There\\u2019s a group of people, vendors, that have lined up these tall skinny tables that are like tubs along the sidewalk. I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s in them - they\\u2019re a little taller than my head, so I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s inside. They\\u2019re probably 1 foot by 2 foot in diameter and maybe another 1 foot deep. At the end of one, there\\u2019s a stepladder and I can climb up to see what\\u2019s in there. As I climb up, I see a whole bunch more of these little discs. I realize that they\\u2019re not made of grain, but of almonds. A woman who appears to be in charge approaches. She says \\u201cAa-mond\\u201d instead of almond. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cIs that the proper way to say this?\\u201d She repeats it twice like a callout: \\u201cAa-mond Aa-mond, Aa-mond Aamond.\\u201d So she\\u2019s selling them. She asks me if I\\u2019m interested in one of the Aa-monds Aa-monds. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you.\\u201d She says, \\u201cCome and sit down with me. I want to talk with you.\\u201d There\\u2019s something that looks like a two-person porch swing where the people are facing each other and your feet sit on the bottom and it moves on its own rocker. She sits in it and indicates that she wants me to sit across from her. So I do. She leans in. She has a smirk on her face as though she thinks it\\u2019s funny and says, \\u201cWhat do you think of Aa-mond Aa-mond?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe catchy way you\\u2019re pronouncing it? Or the product itself?\\u201d She says, No, what do you think of the way I\\u2019m calling it out?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, it\\u2019s catchy. Caught my eye. I don\\u2019t understand what it is, but it was catchy enough that I turned my head to listen to you.\\u201d She kind of laughs. Right at that point, the dream ends, but in front of my face, I see this dangling pendant. It\\u2019s the size of my face and is all silver. It looks like it\\u2019s made out of molded Mercury. It\\u2019s a cat - a wild cat. It\\u2019s strangely futuristic amid this old-style market. It\\u2019s sleek, like a jaguar. It\\u2019s dangling on something. So it just appears and hangs down in front of my face. It\\u2019s probably 8-10 inches long and maybe about 4 inches wide. The mouth is slightly open and the lips are sort of curled back and it has fangs. It really looks like a jaguar head, except its ears are flattened, so there\\u2019s a sleakness about it that really doesn\\u2019t belong in the historical feel of the house, street market or the Aa-mond Aamond that people are selling.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Mural\\u201d It\\u2019s strange that I\\u2019m in the bedroom I had when I was a kid, but the furniture is gone. There are several people here with me, including my daughter and somebody I used to work with - I can\\u2019t remember which restaurant and I\\u2019m not even sure of his name. I think there is the man who did my daughter\\u2019s tattoo. I feel like my stepmother is in there, as well. The point of everybody being there is to draw a mural. It\\u2019s not clear what the subject of the mural is supposed to look like. One person starts off drawing in black with paint and a paintbrush what looks to be a fish. But then somebody comments, \\u201cNo that\\u2019s not right. That\\u2019s not what it looks like,\\u201d and then adjusts it - makes the torso/belly area a little thinner and makes it even thinner as it goes back towards the tail. Then someone else says, \\u201cMmm, that\\u2019s closer, but it still doesn\\u2019t look right.\\u201d Then someone else takes the paintbrush and begins to draw legs on it. Now it\\u2019s starting to look more like an insect with somewhat of a fish face. There\\u2019s a consensus that yes, that\\u2019s much closer to what it resembled. Then my daughter gets in there and removes part of it and adds what I think is much more accurate in terms of the legs and ribcage. Then I fall asleep for a little while, maybe just five minutes. I don\\u2019t think anyone noticed I was sleeping. When I woke up, it\\u2019s stunning. I\\u2019m thinking that it\\u2019s exactly what it looks like and it\\u2019s even got more details. I see the tattoo artist with the paintbrush in his hand and think yes, he would have been the one to put the detail on it. Then the other guy leaves the room and I do, too. We go down the hall and into the kitchen. He stays in the kitchen and I go out front of the kitchen. Now it looks like the kitchen has a passthrough window and the seating area is a big wide square auditorium. There are long rectangular tables set up that hold food, like a wedding buffet. The tables are covered with a white cloth. There are also round tables covered with white cloths and they have multiple chairs at them. There\\u2019s a stage like a school auditorium, but there\\u2019s no one on it and people aren\\u2019t facing the stage, either. The food is all set out on this one L-shaped table. I look at it and think that the food looks disgusting. It looks sloppy. Every single one has dried ramen noodles on the top as some kind of garnish. The items in the bowls are covered with breading. Each one looks slightly the same, only a little different. There are also cheese balls rolled in cracker crumbs and deep fried. I just think, \\u201cUgh, there\\u2019s nothing fresh anywhere.\\u201d My son is sitting at the table and I know he needs to eat. So I take two plates - one for him and one for me - and I head for the platter of plain roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. I think we can eat that. Just as I get there, a man who looks like the man who bought my sailboat. In my dream he has three little kids. He takes the big serving fork and squishes all the chicken up with the mashed potatoes and gravy and it\\u2019s making some kind of thick soup. I\\u2019m aghast because there were dried wheat noodles on the top and now they\\u2019re all mixed in. I say to him, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that on a buffet! Now nobody else can eat that.\\u201d He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWell, my kids like it that way.\\u201d I tell him that now there\\u2019s nothing for us to eat. I\\u2019m angry. I can feel the anger in my body - I can feel my heart racing and my body tightening up. So I try to sift through it with my spoon to determine if there are any pieces of potato or chicken that the gravy and wheat didn\\u2019t stick to. But after putting two tiny spoonfuls on my plate, I know it\\u2019s hopeless and I just set the plates down. My son goes back to the table and he\\u2019s just sitting there. I approach the kitchen and am thinking, \\u201cI wonder if that Rob guy has anything back there that he could give us that is not quite ready to be served on the table and hasn\\u2019t been coated with all that yucky stuff yet.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and notice that at the base of the passthrough window has holes with stagnant water in them. The water is black with algae. I can smell the mildew earth smell rising up from it. I wonder if the water was removed from it, if it would dry up and be more healthy. There\\u2019s a plastic pump with a long hose and a hand pump at the other end. It\\u2019s like the pump you\\u2019d use to pump out the bilge in a sailboat. So I stick the end in the water and I start pumping. The water does go out of the hole, but as soon as it goes out, it fills up again. I repeat this process about three times. It keeps filling up, but it only fills up a little bit, just enough to cover the black earth that is the component part of the hole. So I set the pump down and I stop. I\\u2019m hesitant to ask for food from the kitchen. I go back to the table and tell my son, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just go.\\u201d We walk down a different hallway than we entered the room from. There are multiple bedrooms like there would be in a hotel for people to sleep in.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Operation\\u201d In this dream I\\u2019m at my sister and brother-in-law\\u2019s house. I\\u2019m sitting on a stool in their kitchen with my elbows on the kitchen island. My nephew who is training to be in Medical school - in fact he\\u2019s almost finished - has got a colander out of the cupboard and put three or four potatoes in it. He leaves it on the island and then leaves the kitchen. I think to myself: \\u201cHmm, I guess I\\u2019m supposed to be making the mashed potatoes.\\u201d Instead of cooking them and mashing them with a potato masher, I poke them repeatedly with some sort of instrument that I have in my hand - it\\u2019s some kind of kitchen tool. I do this until they are little tiny pieces of potato in the colander. Two other members of my family (it\\u2019s fuzzy who they are) come in. They are criticizing the way I\\u2019ve done this and saying it won\\u2019t work. My nephew returns to the kitchen and says, \\u201cOh yes, this will work. This is how I learned to do it at school. I\\u2019ve done this before. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d Because he said that, the people who were criticizing me stop criticizing. Then the potatoes are cooked and they\\u2019ve turned out just fine.\"],[\"\\u201cFootball Team\\u201d I'm walking through a pine forest. It\\u2019s fairly dense. I\\u2019m moving my arms up over my head in places so I can get my body through. It starts to get a little more sparse, then comes out into a clearing. There\\u2019s snow everywhere. I see up ahead of me a frost fencing and something that looks like it could be a building, although it\\u2019s mostly masked in snow. I walk through the snow towards the frost fencing. A man is standing there and he\\u2019s giving directions of some sort. He indicates that I am supposed to go straight ahead. As I\\u2019m walking through, other people start to gather. It\\u2019s getting a little more crowded. Then I remember I\\u2019m standing in a circle with people. I have something in my hand but i can\\u2019t see what it is. Other people are standing around and I know one of them - Blake. He gives me a bear hug and says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really good to see you.\\u201d As he lifts me up, my feet are off the ground. I can feel my body stretching - it feels like a full body stretch. When he sets me down, I wish he would do it again because the stretching felt really good. We\\u2019re being told to continue on our way towards the building. I notice the guys are wearing football uniforms - jerseys and pants. I wonder if I\\u2019m there for a game.\"],[\"\\u201cOpen Air Concert\\u201d I\\u2019m standing in a crowd in a large fairground area. There is hard packed earth and grass underneath my feet. It\\u2019s dark - it\\u2019s night time. The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn\\u2019t say anything but I know it\\u2019s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There\\u2019s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he\\u2019s somewhat hard although I don\\u2019t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There\\u2019s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren\\u2019t sitting down though, they\\u2019re just standing up. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don\\u2019t want to sit with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I\\u2019m looking for Trent because he\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen and know. I don\\u2019t find him.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Daughter\\u2019s Fish Tanks\\u201d My daughter is away and my son and I are taking care of her pets. It\\u2019s a two-story house and I\\u2019m really uncertain whether or not we all live together in the safe house or if my son and I are staying in my daughter\\u2019s house for the purpose of taking care of her pets. We\\u2019re on the main floor of the house when the dream starts. We are looking after her cats and some other strange mix of mammal - I\\u2019m not really sure what it is. It has skin that is slightly furry but not a lot of fur, maybe like a horse. It\\u2019s small, a little smaller than a cat. It has a long neck and very appealing eyes. We\\u2019re going about our daily activities. I\\u2019m mucking about in the garden and Daniel is doing his own thing. We feed the mammal-like creatures in the morning and then again at suppertime. We do this for a whole 24-hour day. When I go down to the basement to get something, I see two other tanks there. One of them is a water tank and it\\u2019s filled with water creatures. The other one has reptiles in it. I\\u2019m horrified because the one with the reptiles is a really large, large, large cage and the reptiles are at the bottom but there\\u2019s a tiny very angry chimpanzee about the size of my hand rattling the sides of the cage and screaming because it\\u2019s so hungry. I yell up to my son, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you tell me she\\u2019s got two more down here?!\\u201d He says he\\u2019s sorry and he forgot. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god the snakes are all upset!\\u201d And there\\u2019s a cobra, a black cobra with gold markings on its skin and it\\u2019s half-sitting up with its hood fanned out. All the animals are agitated. The water tank with the fish like ones have their teeth bared and I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to eat each other. I\\u2019m just really horrified and upset that the animals are suffering because we did not feed them. I tell my son to go get the food for the reptiles and the tiny chimpanzee. I\\u2019m looking around for the food for the water tank. So I put the food in the tank and am watching the fish eat it. I notice the water level has dropped down at least a food. I think I\\u2019d better put more water in it. I get a pitcher and fill it with warm water. I\\u2019m checking the temperature with my fingers to make sure it\\u2019s body temperature. I add two pitchers in and now the water is about six inches from the top and I think that\\u2019s good. Then I go to check on the other tank and they seem okay. I\\u2019m just watching their behavior for a few minutes. Then I turn around and the fish tank is full to the top with water! How did this happen? It can\\u2019t be this full because the fish and other creatures will swim overtop of it and out onto the floor and they\\u2019ll die. So I take up the pitcher and I\\u2019m slowly trying to submerge the pitcher a little bit so that only the water goes into the pitcher without also pulling some of the creatures or living plants with it. But one is in there! I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s an aquatic animal or plant. So I try to keep the water in the pitcher and just pour out the creature. I manage to do this and then I pour the excess water into the laundry tub. I go back to the fish tank. My son has poured some hot water in and again I\\u2019m really upset. I feel it with my finger and take some of the water out then add some cold water in and it feels normal again. I\\u2019m looking at them to see if they\\u2019re all still living. I\\u2019m just in such a state of agitation because I know this is terrible for them. As I\\u2019m dumping out one more jug of just water to equalize the temperature, I look and all the water is gone! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, how could you do this?! Go get a jug!\\u201d I\\u2019m putting body temperature water into my son\\u2019s jug and tell him to quickly go put it in the tank. I ask him how long it\\u2019s been like this. Then I take another jug in. I\\u2019m wondering if that\\u2019s enough to keep them breathing until we manage to fill the rest of the tank up. We are frantically doing this. I notice the tank with the reptiles and the small chimpanzee is getting even more and more agitated. I wonder what else is going on where they are or if they\\u2019re agitated because the creatures in the water tank might be dying. I\\u2019m wondering if I should let them all go and maybe they\\u2019ll live. The feeling is quickly mixed in with the fact that my daughter trusted us and I need to soothe this so that they\\u2019re alive when she gets here and allow her to make that decision. I\\u2019m also looking at the expression on the small chimpanzee\\u2019s face. This small chimpanzee is capable of communicating to me what is really happening in the animal world in both tanks.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Shopping Mall\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large urban city. It\\u2019s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can\\u2019t identify where I am because of it. I\\u2019m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I\\u2019ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It\\u2019s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I\\u2019m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says \\u201cyou are here\\u201d and lists the index of all the stores, but I don\\u2019t see one. Because I\\u2019m still looking, I\\u2019m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren\\u2019t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they\\u2019re offering. They\\u2019re all specialty shops. Each store that\\u2019s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they\\u2019re not made of raincoat material or anything; they\\u2019re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they\\u2019ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there\\u2019s very little inventory offered in each. I think, \\u201cWow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.\\u201d Then I figure that whatever it is that they\\u2019re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what\\u2019s in the windows and note in a general way, \\u201cOh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I\\u2019m not even going to look at it.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cAdventures\\u201d I take a taxi to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I arrive and he\\u2019s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I\\u2019m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I\\u2019m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He\\u2019s also wearing something similar. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t really look like pajamas, so it\\u2019s okay to go out in them.\\u201d So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He\\u2019s in the front seat, passenger side. I\\u2019m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I\\u2019ve ever been to the town stadium. I\\u2019m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, \\u201cDo you mean the Place or the Colosseum?\\u201d At the same time as he\\u2019s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He\\u2019s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I\\u2019m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we\\u2019re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It\\u2019s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it\\u2019s glassed in and there\\u2019s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it\\u2019s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there\\u2019s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I\\u2019ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He\\u2019s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I\\u2019m trying to think where I\\u2019ve seen him. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He\\u2019s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they\\u2019re hundreds of years old. They look like they\\u2019re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it\\u2019s old because the lawns aren\\u2019t maincured, but set because they\\u2019ve been cared for so long they don\\u2019t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it\\u2019s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800\\u2019s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you\\u2019re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It\\u2019s just a screen door and is not latched. I can\\u2019t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman\\u2019s voice say, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I answer back, \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It\\u2019s a kitchen. It\\u2019s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it\\u2019s made just for cooking. There\\u2019s a doorway and we go into the next room. There\\u2019s a proper sized eating table in it. There\\u2019s another oven on the wall and I don\\u2019t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it\\u2019s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn\\u2019t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you\\u2019re on the waterfront. We\\u2019re about to go down the steps when I say, \\u201cJust a minute. Let\\u2019s walk back through here again. I noticed something.\\u201d So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, \\u201cLook, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There\\u2019s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn\\u2019t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.\\u201d Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We\\u2019re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I\\u2019m walking. He doesn\\u2019t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It\\u2019s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I\\u2019m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He\\u2019s a little more scared than I. I\\u2019m surprised that he\\u2019s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it\\u2019s like a pig fetus. It\\u2019s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He\\u2019s getting a little scared. It\\u2019s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I\\u2019m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can\\u2019t see it if you\\u2019re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There\\u2019s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there\\u2019s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They\\u2019re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there\\u2019s this other kind of thing that I see. It\\u2019s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to swim in that water.\\u201d Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She\\u2019s clothed and under the water. It looks like she\\u2019s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, \\u201cOh no! We have to save her!\\u201d So, I slip into the water and grab her. She\\u2019s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady\\u2019s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There\\u2019s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she\\u2019s only been hanging onto the pole and she\\u2019s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she\\u2019s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She\\u2019s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, \\u201cLook, she\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I\\u2019m giving her small sips and supporting her head.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Hanson Family Home\\u201d I am at a picnic table outside near the side of a road. There are two picnic tables. Although we can\\u2019t see the cars driving by from this area, I know we\\u2019re right beside a highway. There\\u2019s a gravel shoulder at the edge of a big road on one side of us. There\\u2019s a rough grassy area that\\u2019s speckled with dirt and gravel; there\\u2019s not very much growing there, just a little bit of grass. These two picnic tables are angled in an L-shape. There's a really rough structure, like what you\\u2019d find at a really old gas station store, but there are no gas pumps. So I\\u2019m sitting there and we\\u2019ve got some kind of meal. We\\u2019re evaluating whether or not this thing you sit in can be seen or noticed. One looks like a bathtub and the sides are copper, but it\\u2019s copper coating over enamel and the copper is being used to disguise it; the edges are probably about fourteen inches. There\\u2019s another one where the edges do not come up so high and they are only about six inches tall, but there\\u2019s a lip around the outside. It\\u2019s also been copper coated. We\\u2019re sitting in them on top of the picnic table bench. The other people at the table (not in the tubs) are saying whether or not this is noticeable. We think the shorter one will be less noticable. As it turns out, when we get a good look at them and people are sitting in them, the one that goes up fourteen inches kind of hugs your rib cage and sits under your armpits and because of the copper color, blends in with what people are wearing. You can\\u2019t really notice anyone is sitting in it as they\\u2019re eating. Whereas the other one has that big lip that sticks out and it\\u2019s a vast color difference between the tub and the people\\u2019s bodies and the shape of it is unnatural. So, we\\u2019re reporting back that the shorter one is not a good disguise. Then the scene changes and we\\u2019re in the Hanson\\u2019s house, only there is hardly any furniture in it and in some rooms, there\\u2019s none. The parents are there. The mom especially is more visible than the dad but I know he\\u2019s there somewhere. We walk in the door and the mom is sitting on a ladder facing away from it. She\\u2019s reading something. We go through that room which is empty of furniture. We go into a sitting room with a couch along one wall and where the tv would have been, there is nothing. No one is sitting there. Then we walk into what would have been the dining room. Again, there\\u2019s nothing in it. We go into the kitchen, which is now just an island attached to the wall with cupboards overtop. We walk in between the island and the wall to where the kitchen sink and counter occupy the whole end of the wall. I\\u2019m with Carrie, the youngest member of the family. Her older sister was my best friend in high school and in real life she\\u2019s gone - she died of cancer - but in my dream she\\u2019s still there as a ghost. Carrie and I are trying to wash a mountain of dishes that their four brothers and friends created. It\\u2019s horrible! I pick up one bag off the floor; it\\u2019s a shopping bag that was full of egg salad and some of the egg salad spills out onto the floor. I\\u2019m trying to scoop it up back into the abg. There\\u2019s all this gooped on food and you can\\u2019t even wash the dishes until you sort out dirty dishes from garbage, so we\\u2019re doing that. As we\\u2019re doing that, we\\u2019re hearing a conversation coming from the room with the couch. We\\u2019re both listening and trying to figure out what the two guys are saying. One is one of her middle brothers. He sounds different though. The other is a stranger and we don\\u2019t know who he is. The stranger sounds like he\\u2019s trying to sell something to her brother. We just don\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s trying to sell and it doesn\\u2019t make any sense. Her brother is kind of interested but not responding entirely favorably to the sales pitch. Then there\\u2019s silence - they both fall silent. I said to her: \\u201cDon\\u2019t your parents live in a different house now? Did they keep this house you grew up in? Are just you kids living in it? Are you all splitting the mortgage or rent?\\u201d Then, we turn around and the stranger is coming in through what would have been the eating kitchen. He stands there and addresses us; he\\u2019s trying to give us the same pitch. I\\u2019m highly suspicious of him. He looks and sounds slimy like a salesman trying to sell something that isn\\u2019t authentic. He looks wormy - his body shape is kind of wormy; he\\u2019s really pale and slender and he\\u2019s got tight cropped mousy brown hair and a nondescript face. I automatically don\\u2019t like him. Carrie and I look at each other with a slitty eyed look, like, \\u201cRight this guy\\u2019s gotta go!\\u201d She says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll handle this.\\u201d She turns around and says, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d I continue cleaning up the dishes and am making some headway now - I scrape the garbage into one bag and am washing. When I\\u2019m finished, I go into the room where they are. The guy that I thought was her brother was actually a student from my advanced yoga teacher training, only he\\u2019s gained 200 pounds. He\\u2019s wearing an old man\\u2019s housecoat that you put on over your head. You can sort of see the rolls of fat of his body through the mesh of the robe and it has the big cotton pockets on the front. He and Carrie have obviously had some kind of conversation and the stranger is gone. We go back through the room where her mom was sitting on the ladder, but her mom is gone. Now we\\u2019re climbing up the stairs to go to the upper floor with just three bedrooms. Two of the boys share one, the other two share another and Carrie and her sister share the third. But Ellie\\u2019s bed is empty and Carrie is in the room by herself. She answers the question I asked her earlier and says, \\u201cNo, we don\\u2019t have an extra house. This is still our family home.\\u201d I\\u2019m surprised and feel confused because in the pictures, there is furniture in the house and this one doesn\\u2019t look like either home. I look over at Ellie\\u2019s empty bed and it is still the way she left it the last time she slept there. It has the green plaid bedspread and some of the ways she would have creatively decorated their tiny room. There\\u2019s something of mine in the room, too, because I stayed overnight there. I decide to pack my things up and it\\u2019s time to go.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arrangement\\u201d The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor\\u2019s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It\\u2019s some kind of reception, but I\\u2019m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don\\u2019t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he\\u2019s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he\\u2019s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I\\u2019ve earned it. I see in my mind\\u2019s eyes the word, \\u201cPlacement\\u201d on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I\\u2019m talking to them and realize I\\u2019m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It\\u2019s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There\\u2019s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It\\u2019s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It\\u2019s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he\\u2019s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I\\u2019m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I\\u2019m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I\\u2019m moving from one group to another making sure they\\u2019re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I\\u2019m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I\\u2019m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I\\u2019m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It\\u2019s hard for me to do this. I\\u2019m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It\\u2019s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There\\u2019s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I\\u2019m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don\\u2019t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll just sit with you.\\u201d This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There\\u2019s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It\\u2019s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it\\u2019s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I\\u2019m just now understanding this. So I\\u2019m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven\\u2019t had any time to get to know each other. I don\\u2019t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They\\u2019re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what\\u2019s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don\\u2019t. But my arranged husband does. There\\u2019s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we\\u2019re all in my arranged husband\\u2019s car and driving up towards his house. It\\u2019s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I\\u2019m responsible for making food. I\\u2019ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They\\u2019re working on a collaborative project. I\\u2019m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, \\u201cWell, is there anything else I can eat? I\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHere.\\u201d I say here, \\u201cYou can make the toast.\\u201d I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I\\u2019m feeling more at home. I\\u2019m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I\\u2019m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There\\u2019s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I\\u2019ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon. She says, \\u201cNo, all we have is on the racks.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve chosen this chapter book I thought he would like and see it. I tell him that\\u2019s not the book I wanted to get him and describe the stories in the book that I wanted to give him. This builds a little bit more of a bridge between us.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Line Up\\u201d I\\u2019m in a doctor\\u2019s office but it\\u2019s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I\\u2019ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We\\u2019re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There\\u2019s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren\\u2019t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we\\u2019re looking at is the demographic of people who don\\u2019t believe in paying their bills online or don\\u2019t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can\\u2019t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we\\u2019re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they\\u2019re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It\\u2019s mostly elderly people. But there\\u2019s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It\\u2019s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I\\u2019m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, \\u201cMy appointment was at 8. It\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?\\u201d The receptionist who looks like my son\\u2019s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. This isn\\u2019t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone\\u2019s appointment was scheduled for 8am.\\u201d I feel like screaming at her but I don\\u2019t. I tell her that I understand it\\u2019s not her fault, but inside I\\u2019m frustrated and angry. I\\u2019m dizzy and starting to get a headache. I go back and sit down. Now it\\u2019s almost 5pm. There is a person that does the procedure I came for and I know they tend to leave a little bit earlier than the rest of the staff. I go back to the desk and say, \\u201cAm I still going to be able to get this done today?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you have two choices. You can wait until we open in the morning or I can give you this syringe and you can inject yourself at home. You still have to wait for your appointment.\\u201dI have this dissonance between my inner landscape which is angry and frustrated and tired and hungry and thirsty with what I\\u2019m saying to her. I tell her I\\u2019ll take the syringe full of medicine. Then I say, \\u201cWell wait a sec, if I have to stay anyways, is she going to be back tomorrow?\\u201d She tells me she is. I say, \\u201cWell nevermind then, I might as well wait and have her do it properly since I have to stay here overnight anyway.\\u201d She hands it to me anyway, and says, \\u201cWell take it just in case.\\u201d She hands me a syringe full of liquid medicine. I go back and realize that while I\\u2019ve been talking to her someone who arrived after me has gone in and got their appointment. I\\u2019m unbelievably agitated. I also realize this is just great, I\\u2019m going to have to stay overnight because you\\u2019re not allowed to go home. If you go home they put you back in the line up, so it\\u2019s a never ending cycle of having to wait from 8am until the end of the day when they can\\u2019t even take you. I push two chairs together and try and stretch my body across the chairs. My friend is doing the same thing. We take off our coats and use them as pillows and lie down. The night passes with me not being able to sleep because I\\u2019m too hungry and too thirsty. I wish I had water. I\\u2019m feeling that restlessness in your legs from not getting enough exercise. So, I start to walk around the building. I walk around twenty times and then come back in and it\\u2019s past midnight. I get back in the chairs and go to sleep. I sleep for maybe five minutes and am woken up. Some part of the chair is sticking in my back - it\\u2019s wooden and pressing in my thigh so I feel like I\\u2019m getting a bruise. I stay awake until I see the morning light coming into the building. I sit up in my chair and see the people come back to the desk. I feel like threatening them somehow and saying I\\u2019d better be first! That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Working Vacation\\u201d I\\u2019m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I\\u2019m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I\\u2019m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn\\u2019t look like that now. There\\u2019s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It\\u2019s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it\\u2019s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They\\u2019re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that\\u2019s really sturdy. I don\\u2019t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it\\u2019s that big. It\\u2019s on its side and they\\u2019re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don\\u2019t really know what they\\u2019re building but they\\u2019re quite busy with it. They\\u2019re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they\\u2019re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they\\u2019re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It\\u2019s a mixed group of boys and girls and it\\u2019s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn\\u2019t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I\\u2019m not really sure what I\\u2019m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it\\u2019s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they\\u2019re doing and it doesn't look like they\\u2019re really doing anything except running around, I\\u2019m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don\\u2019t enter. There\\u2019s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don\\u2019t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn\\u2019t matter in the dream, so I\\u2019ll use the pronoun \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that\\u2019s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they\\u2019ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they\\u2019re exactly the same length and width. I think that\\u2019s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they\\u2019re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they\\u2019re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you want the other shoe?\\u201d The child doesn\\u2019t respond to me. I\\u2019m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I\\u2019m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn\\u2019t. I just wait around and all I\\u2019m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I\\u2019m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I\\u2019m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it\\u2019s a little darker than it is outside. There\\u2019s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It\\u2019s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We\\u2019re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I\\u2019m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She\\u2019s around 8. I notice that she doesn\\u2019t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We\\u2019ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we\\u2019re in a meadow now. We\\u2019re still walking and the sun sets and we\\u2019re in twilight. I wonder if we\\u2019re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don\\u2019t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can\\u2019t sleep. I\\u2019m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they\\u2019re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter\\u2019s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter\\u2019s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what\\u2019s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I\\u2019m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I\\u2019m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that\\u2019s strange. I\\u2019m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, \\u201cI think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.\\u201d She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don\\u2019t have a bathing suit so I\\u2019m just wearing something that won\\u2019t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we\\u2019d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn\\u2019t very big. Then I\\u2019m not sure how we\\u2019re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they\\u2019re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Red Coat\\u201d I\\u2019m in the Central Hotel for a gathering. There are a lot of people. It\\u2019s packed. It feels dark and stuffy. I\\u2019m wearing a red jacket over a dress. Someone who works there takes my jacket and hangs it up for me. I go to sit down at a table. I\\u2019m supposed to meet people there. As I sit down, I realize that everyone is meeting there prior to moving next door for a wedding. I take my seat and am scanning the room for people I know. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I just sit in the seat. I\\u2019m waiting until we are going to be notified that we\\u2019re moving. Then it seems rather sudden that someone from the hotel circulates through the guests telling them it\\u2019s time to move. They\\u2019re saying things that cause us to be hasty and move quickly and not to linger. I get up and move with the flow of the crowd. We exit out the front door and immediately take a left and go into the door beside it, then up a long set of stairs and into a big room. The room we just left was crowded and stuffy but had kind of a homey atmosphere - the decor was of wood with wood posts that held the ceiling up and it had that well oiled hand hewn feel to it. This upstairs room is just one big rectangle that\\u2019s maybe hastily put together. No one sits and stays for a long time. It remains empty. There\\u2019s no warmth when you walk in. There's a long table. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m supposed to sit here. Again, I\\u2019m scanning the room for people I know. I see two people who used to live in my neighborhood and I thought were my friends. They know I\\u2019m there but keep to themselves and make no effort to come talk to me. I seem to know the people I\\u2019m sitting with but I can\\u2019t identify them in the dream. I realize we\\u2019re here for a reception. The servers bring food out. Everybody has the same plate of food. We eat without gusto. The servers take the food away and place dessert on the table. I pick at it. They sit down jugs of beer, but I don\\u2019t normally drink beer. I take a little bit in a cup and it tastes refreshing and very cold. I drink about half my cup. People are getting up out of their seats and moving into smaller groupings. There\\u2019s lively talk coming from these groupings. I feel isolated and unwelcome. I\\u2019m not sure what the reception is for. I get up and circulate a little. There\\u2019s a little dancing. I want to dance but there\\u2019s no one to dance with. I like the music and am feeling the dance in my body but there\\u2019s no one to share it with. I see someone who used to be a neighbor and go down to her. She says hello and talks with me for a few minutes. We sit down in chairs. I go to show her something on Facebook, but there\\u2019s no internet signal and my phone won\\u2019t load it. She gets bored and wanders away while I\\u2019m waiting. I just close my phone up and put it back in my purse. I go into the original room where I saw my old neighbors and they\\u2019re still involved in a conversation. They see me but don\\u2019t wave or beckon me over. I feel like I just want to go home now. Then I realize my red jacket is missing. I ask one of the staff if it\\u2019s possible to go downstairs and get it from the coat rack. They tell me that downstairs is now closed. It\\u2019s really cold out and I need my jacket. Now I'm unsure what to do. I stand by the doorway and another staff person comes up and says, \\u201cI\\u2019ve found three red jackets downstairs. Is one of these yours?\\u201d I think the first one is. It\\u2019s a felt jacket and it\\u2019s long. I put it on as though I recognize it. It\\u2019s comfortable and feels like it fits me. Then I see the other red jacket and think, \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s my grandfather\\u2019s coat.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m mistaken. The one I\\u2019m wearing is not mine. The noisy one is mine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell just keep the other one.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I can't do that, it\\u2019s not mine. It belongs to somebody.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, no one has claimed it. It\\u2019s been here for a long time.\\u201d I take it off and put on my grandfather\\u2019s coat. I\\u2019m holding it because he\\u2019s not giving me anywhere to put it. There are no hangers and he\\u2019s walking away. I feel uncomfortable that I have this coat that\\u2019s not mine. Then I go out the door because now they\\u2019re closing. I have this coat that doesn\\u2019t belong to me over my arm. I\\u2019m not sure how far to go with it, so I stand across the street because i can\\u2019t stay in the building.\"],[\"\\u201cFor a Little While\\u201d I\\u2019m in a village. It\\u2019s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don\\u2019t live in houses. It\\u2019s outside living. People\\u2019s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I\\u2019m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it\\u2019s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I\\u2019m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I\\u2019m waiting for her dad. I know he\\u2019s there but he\\u2019s invisible. He has a presence but I haven\\u2019t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we\\u2019re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I\\u2019m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It\\u2019s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there\\u2019s food you can eat with your fingers that\\u2019s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we\\u2019ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there\\u2019s privacy from everyone else\\u2019s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He\\u2019s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He\\u2019s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he\\u2019s still there in spirit but in the flesh he\\u2019s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we\\u2019re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She\\u2019s looking around. I think to myself, \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for the parents she doesn\\u2019t have.\\u201d I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I\\u2019m happy to look after her. She\\u2019s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter\\u2019s father. I miss that he can\\u2019t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.\"],[\"\\u201cGutting the Backpack - Lucid Dream\\u201d This is one of those lucid dreams where you just close your eyes for a moment and your body is rooted down despite the fact that you feel like you want to get up and move. I\\u2019m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There\\u2019s liquid or digestive juices with it. I\\u2019m horrified for a moment, then I think: \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s not an animal, that\\u2019s a backpack!\\u201d The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It\\u2019s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn\\u2019t open it with a zipper.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Symphony\\u201d I\\u2019m at my friends Maggie and Joey\\u2019s house, only it\\u2019s not their house, it\\u2019s the old Farm House. Maggie and Joey live there. I\\u2019ve gone up to visit them. Maggie has all kinds of little interesting things for us to do. We\\u2019re making jelly at one point. Then we go into a different room and are doing a craft. We\\u2019re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he\\u2019s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That\\u2019s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on with him because he\\u2019s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, \\u201cCome and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he\\u2019s wearing a tux.\\u201d I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some \\u201cdoing of the hair.\\u201d I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She\\u2019s got several things that she\\u2019s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don\\u2019t think anything of this. I think she\\u2019s just seeing how this will look or how these two items will look if you put them together. Then she says to me, \\u201cI can\\u2019t go. I\\u2019m really sick. I don\\u2019t feel up to this. But it\\u2019s something Joey really wants to do.\\u201d I ask her, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re sick?\\u201d She tells me she\\u2019s been sick for a really long time and she thinks that her time is limited. I feel this grief moving up through my feet, through my legs and into my heart. It kind of suspends all my decision making qualities. I\\u2019m just standing there trying to take this all in. i look at her really closely, looking for traces of truth, not of her words, but that her body is actually that sick. I\\u2019m looking at her skin and the sclera of her eyes. I\\u2019m trying to see what I have not noticed before and wasn\\u2019t aware of. Then I tell her I don\\u2019t want to go to the symphony and she should do this because it\\u2019s something special and they\\u2019ve been planning it for a long time. Then suddenly her hair is drawn back into a formal style with a bun at the back of her head. She\\u2019s wearing earrings that dangle down from her ears. She\\u2019s dressed in a strapless gown. She looks beautiful. We go back down the stairs. This time she disappears into the kitchen. I\\u2019m in the living room and Joey is standing there. I say, \\u201cI hope you guys have a really good time. This will be wonderful. You two look fabulous.\\u201d He comes over and gives me a hug. His face is overtop my left shoulder. I can feel that he\\u2019s crying. He says, \\u201cI hope you're still here when we get back.\\u201d Now I just feel kind of numb. I feel heavy. I no longer know what to do while they\\u2019re gone and I don\\u2019t want to stay in the house but I do. I look outside down the long farmhouse style driveway. All the earth looks frozen. The trees are bare. There\\u2019s no growth left in the ground. It\\u2019s nighttime. Even in the activity that was in the house of jamming things in jars and making preserves is tucked away. The house feels empty. I think, \\u201cMaybe I should just have a bath and go to bed.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe RV\\u201d I\\u2019m in an RV. It's kind of close quarters. There are at least three other people with me. We\\u2019re taking turns going to the back of the RV and using the washroom facilities. My belongings are in a suitcase tucked under the back bed and there is always something else on top of it or beside it, and always some waiting for someone else to get their things out first, so I can get to mine. It\\u2019s really cramped. Everything always seems rushed. I\\u2019m supposed to be hosting some kind of group discussion and I\\u2019ve been planning it for some time. There\\u2019s about twenty people involved and a certain day that it happens. In my dream, today is the day. I\\u2019m trying to use the washroom and get my clothes out, but there\\u2019s always someone else in there. I\\u2019m starting to feel rushed and I\\u2019m going to be late. I have this other book satchel that I brought on the trip and it had all the things I needed for the group discussion. It was all organized and I put it in there before the trip. There were pens I needed and a little tiny laptop and paper and a couple of other things that look like slim books, and they all fit in there nicely. I can\\u2019t find this. Someone has moved this. I\\u2019m looking for the people in the RV to ask them: \\u201cWho moved my thing? Where did you put it? I need it and have to go now.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time to go and I can\\u2019t find it. So this lady named Maria says, \\u201cHere, I have a few pencils and a pad of paper you can use.\\u201d I notice that hers have her name on everything. Everything I\\u2019m using says Maria. I think that was a really good idea that she had. I thank her and exit out the RV. I go back behind it to a long building and I enter the building. There\\u2019s a big room like a studio room. People are already there and sitting and waiting. One of the people that signed up, before I can get to the place they\\u2019ve left empty for me, he sits down in it. I wonder what he\\u2019s doing. He opens this paperback book and starts reading these really cryptic sentences. I think, \\u201cWhat does that even mean? I can\\u2019t even recognize any part of that sentence as relating to the subject matter we\\u2019re gathered here for.\\u201d Now while I was happy to give him some time leading the group, because he was part of this group, I see everyone else is looking puzzled and it\\u2019s my responsibility to facilitate. I think I should redirect this somehow. So I quietly shuffle around the outside of the circle and come down on my hands and He holds up the cover and it\\u2019s some completely different book, completely different topic. So I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, well, I had something scheduled before this, but my group didn\\u2019t show up or they were late. So I thought I would just take this time to get my stuff in anyway,\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t really do anything about this without completely disrupting and if they\\u2019re listening, I\\u201dll just walk away.\\u201d So I do. I leave him there to talk about whatever he was trying to talk about with my group. I get halfway back to the RV and three of the other group members have also left and run up behind me. They say, \\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don't know. He just usurped my group and is using it for his own purposes.\\u201d They say, \\u201cWell, we came to hear you, so we\\u2019re not going back,\\u201d and they leave. I get to the RV and open up the door. Maria is sitting at the driver\\u2019s seat. I tell her, \\u201cThank you very much for your things. I didn\\u2019t need them. I really like the nametags. Where did you get them?\\u201d I tell her that Brad was taking over the group and say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t he one of your students?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, he is. He shouldn\\u2019t be doing that. I\\u2019m going to go see what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d She leaves the RV. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m sitting in some kind of classroom. The desks are in rows. I\\u2019m sitting in a row, second desk from the front. There is no teacher in the room. The desk is empty. There\\u2019s nothing written on the board. The classroom door is open. I can see out into the hallway. Perpendicular to the open door is a long table and it has two women sitting at it. They\\u2019re busy writing things. I know that they are receptionists. There\\u2019s a little bit of a ripple of whispering that goes through the classroom. It sounds the way people would whisper when they\\u2019re alarmed - the uplifting and more staccato notes of the voices. I hear the word, \\u201csnakes.\\u201d All of a sudden I realize they must be talking about the two boa constrictors that are normally lazing around in the large tanks at the back of the room behind me in the back row. Without turning around to look to see if they are actually missing, I get up and start looking on the floor. I\\u2019m walking really slowly, so as not to alarm the snakes because they\\u2019re normally just lie there and not bother anyone as they rarely eat and they sleep a lot. I don\\u2019t see any lying around the perimeter of the classroom. I look out to where the desks are and where the secretaries are sitting. I see the really long one, it\\u2019s longer than the length of the table they\\u2019re seated at. It\\u2019s snuggled itself up against the baseboard. I\\u2019m thinking that if I just quietly go up to their desk and tell them not to be alarmed but they should move slowly and quietly then we can get the snake and return it to its home and this will be fine. Also I didn\\u2019t tell anybody else in the classroom because I don\\u2019t want a whole bunch of noise and people running around making a whole bunch of vibrations and stampede sounds on the floor. That would also alarm the snake. I just quietly get up and wander slowly towards the door. All of a sudden there\\u2019s this big alarm voice. People are yelling, \\u201cSnake!!!\\u201d at the top of their lungs. They\\u2019re climbing over each other and on top of the desks and are trying to get out. By this time, I\\u2019m standing right in front of the secretaries\\u2019 table. The secretaries leap out of their chairs and run the opposite direction. I see that the snake has rolled out so it\\u2019s halfway underneath the secretaries\\u2019 table now. But I\\u2019m still not alarmed. I turn around to go back into the classroom. I haven\\u2019t decided what to do. But I\\u2019m thinking there\\u2019s a handler\\u2019s fork at the back of the classroom by the cages. It\\u2019s got a six-foot long handle and a \\u201cU\\u201d on the top of it, and you can just pick the snake up with it and guide it back to its home. Normally the snakes will tolerate this. So I\\u2019m walking calmly towards the back of the room and I just turn around to make sure the snake is still under the table, and it\\u2019s not! It has accordioned itself up, so now instead of it having an eight-foot long body, it has a two-foot long body tightly coiled like a spring that\\u2019s loaded. I think that\\u2019s weird because constrictors don\\u2019t normally do that. In a split second, it has released the spring and I feel it hit my back and it\\u2019s biting right at the back of my heart. It has teeth now. The teeth won\\u2019t let go of me. I arch my back trying to break it\\u2019s grip. It doesn\\u2019t. I start shaking my upper body and arching and twisting my spine, trying to dislodge its teeth, and it does. It goes back down to the floor and now I\\u2019m running, getting up on the desks, still trying to get the fork so i can use it to defend myself. I\\u2019m hoping it\\u2019s not going to reload itself into that spring and lunge at me again.\"],[\"\\u201cOld School\\u201d I\\u2019m both in the place when it existed in its own time and again later as some kind of impermanent guest. In the dream, when it starts, I\\u2019m living there. Then it\\u2019s almost like the time I spent actually living there is a memory I\\u2019m unaware of as I re-enter it. The setting is a cleared area in a forest. The structures are really rustic; they\\u2019ve been hand-hewn and erected without machines. Everything has been done by hand. In fact, the floor inside one of the structures, the one I\\u2019m in, is made of gravel and wood chips and it\\u2019s quite chunky. I\\u2019m inside one of these structures in the village and looking out the window. I look at the other structures from the window and think, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s interesting. When they resurrected this, they put them in a different spot than they originally were.\\u201d I notice that the windows aren\\u2019t made of glass, but something a little opaque. I\\u2019m not quite sure what the material is. I\\u2019m inside one of these and it\\u2019s definitely the biggest of the structures and has two floors. I don\\u2019t go to the upper floor. I\\u2019m sitting on something and it\\u2019s not really a couch - it\\u2019s something stuffed with straw or horse hair. I\\u2019ve got a binder with me. I take it out and it\\u2019s study notes. I realize that I should have looked at these earlier because I actually have a lesson plan that\\u2019s due today. I'm not worried though. I think. \\u201cAh, that\\u2019s fine. I just have to sit here and sit still and do it.\\u201d So I start to read through the instructions and I hear some people talking in one of the other rooms. I stand up and walk over the rough floor and sure enough there are two other people. I\\u2019m wearing headphones at this point. One of the men is telling a story to the other man sitting there about how he got one of his jobs and a job he was quite happy with. He had been called in to fill in for someone else. He had some kind of project and no one had ever seen this kind of projector before. It put all of the work he needed to teach up on a whiteboard and it was really easy, it was compact, it was able to stream a whole bunch of different things into one machine. The way he told the story, people were marveling at it, asking him where he got it, etc. He had picked it up from somewhere exotic. They had called him in to do this kind of work in this school on a regular basis and they hadn\\u2019t hired anyone for years and years and years apparently, according to him. What he didn't realize is that my headphones were picking up the entire conversation he was having with his friend. His friend realized this and said, \\u201cI see we have someone else on the line.\\u201d He said, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s just Lynn.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re right, my headphones are picking it up, but I\\u2019m not Lynn.\\u201d Then I try to reach around to my ears and see if I can find some buttons that would turn off their conversation, although it had been interesting. I actually want quiet so I can do my own work. I leave the area where they had been making contact with each other. I realize as I was leaving that they weren\\u2019t even there and the whole thing was a hologram. I go back to my binder and sit on the stuffed cushion. I hear someone coming down the stairs from the upper floor. It\\u2019s a woman. I tell her that I\\u2019m going to do these lesson plans here. She just acknowledges that and drifts off. I don\\u2019t see her again. As I\\u2019m looking through the lesson plan, someone from my headphones asks me what I want to teach when I finish my program. I don\\u2019t know who it is - it\\u2019s like a disembodied voice. I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve worked with kids before and I really don\\u2019t think I want to put that much physical energy into my day, plus they get sick a lot. I really want to be in an environment where there\\u2019s not so much illness. Middle school, eh, that\\u2019s a lot of work, too, but in a different way. Maybe?\\u201d I realize that as I\\u2019m telling this, I want to teach high school because the environment is generally cleaner in terms of illness. You don\\u2019t need as much equipment because the kids don\\u2019t need to be entertained. I\\u2019m thinking that if I had the same technology that I overheard the man talking about in the other room, then the high school kids would be engaged and it\\u2019s really quite compact and doesn\\u2019t take up much space. I put this to voice and say, \\u201cYou know, I think I want to teach high school kids.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cRed Sand\\u201d I\\u2019m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I\\u2019m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it\\u2019s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it\\u2019s actually ending. She\\u2019s co-teaching with another person I\\u2019ve never seen. I think it\\u2019s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I\\u2019ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It\\u2019s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they\\u2019ve obviously already had their asana class and they\\u2019re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it\\u2019s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we\\u2019re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she\\u2019s white, if the whole class was like this or if it\\u2019s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it\\u2019s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I\\u2019m surprised to see her. She says, \\u201cNo, the whole class was like this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d So I ask her, \\u201cIs this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d There are six people. I think, \\u201cWow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.\\u201d Then I say to her, \\u201cI have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.\\u201d I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I\\u2019m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don\\u2019t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that\\u2019s leaving. As I\\u2019m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don\\u2019t even know what they are. But I\\u2019m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith\\u2019s flute looks like an obo, but it\\u2019s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it\\u2019s such beautiful music. You can tell they\\u2019ve played together for a really long time because they\\u2019re really tight together. They\\u2019re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there\\u2019s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I\\u2019ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, \\u201cGood, we\\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\\u201d The music has something to do with what they\\u2019ve been practicing in the class. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, \\u201cI hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.\\u201d We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we\\u2019re at the outskirts of town. He says, \\u201cLook what they\\u2019re going to put on this land.\\u201d He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he\\u2019s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he\\u2019s doing this, I\\u2019m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, \\u201cOh, I think there\\u2019s red clay under this.\\u201d I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, \\u201cLook. There\\u2019s red sand underneath here.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just spray painted. I say, \\u201cI don't think so, it looks real. It\\u2019s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.\\u201d He\\u2019s quiet and doesn\\u2019t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he\\u2019s adding onto it so it\\u2019s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.\"],[\"\\u201cHomeless\\u201d This dream just seems to start where I\\u2019m in a house that\\u2019s not mine. I was only able to bring a few of my things. One of the things is my spices. I found a big shelf for them. It\\u2019s deep enough to hold a spice bottle. There are eight shelves just spice bottle height apart. They\\u2019re pretty wide and there are two of them. I found them somewhere; somebody threw them in the garbage. I thought to myself: \\u201cThese would be perfect for my spices.\\u201d I am surprised when I see them on the wall and wonder who did that. Anyway, they\\u2019re there and I\\u2019m glad to see them. I\\u2019m looking around for my clothes and I don\\u2019t know where they are, but I\\u2019m sure I was able to bring them. The bed is as wide as it is long. It must be a King size bed. I realize that that\\u2019s where I\\u2019m sleeping. As I\\u2019m looking through the dressers for my clothes, someone comes in and it\\u2019s Keith who I know from the studio. He\\u2019s sleeping on the other part of the bed. I feel really uncomfortable with this arrangement, but I\\u2019m glad I at least have somewhere to sleep. I move as far to the opposite edge of the bed as I can. When he enters the room he tells me, \\u201cOh by the way, your clothes are in that dresser.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay good. I\\u2019ve got something to cook with and I\\u2019ve got some clothes.\\u201d I also have a wagon with a handle. I sleep but it\\u2019s a restless sleep. I\\u2019m too conscious of not rolling into him or something. The night passes. I see that the light at the windows is moving from dark to grey so I can get up now. As I\\u2019m getting out of bed, I accidentally lean my elbow on a part of his private parts and I feel really bad, but he doesn\\u2019t wake up. I get up anyway. I\\u2019m sorting through the clothes in the dresser, trying to put what\\u2019s mine in the wagon. I think, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s no room for the spices, I guess I\\u2019m going to have to leave them here.\\u201d So I leave the house adn go out onto the sidewalk. I\\u2019ve put too many things in the wagon and the sides aren\\u2019t high enough, so they keep falling out and getting dirty on the ground. But I don\\u2019t have anywhere to wash them. As I\\u2019m at the intersection, there\\u2019s a big mailbox. I don\\u2019t have a key for it. The postal service worker has opened the front of the mailbox so I can see what\\u2019s in my mailbox. It\\u2019s a whole bunch of CDs. I think, \\u201cOh, I mailed those to myself so I can still have them.\\u201d But the postal service worker says I\\u2019m not allowed to keep those in the mailbox and instructs me to take them out right then and there. I already don\\u2019t have enough room for my clothes and wonder how this is all going to fit in the wagon. I take all the clothes out and think, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re dirty anyway.\\u201d So I put them out on the ground and it\\u2019s a slushy snowy day. I put the CDs in the bottom of the wagon, then put the clothes back on top. It actually works out not too badly. I think, \\u201cWell, okay.\\u201d Then, I\\u2019m walking along the sidewalk. I\\u2019ve been invited to go to this staff meeting at the hospital where I used to teach. So I drag the wagon along with me, walk all the way to the hospital, enter the hospital, find the staff room and go in. it\\u2019s a Christmas party. They all have brought food to share. I don\\u2019t have anything so I feel conspicuous. The ladies, however, are really nice and they\\u2019re saying how much they miss my classes and what a good teacher I am. The feeling of being conspicuous and awkward starts to wear off a bit. This one lady says, \\u201cOh look at what I\\u2019ve got on DVD!\\u201d It\\u2019s one of my classes. She says, \\u201cHere, we can actually do the class. We haven\\u2019t had a cardio class in years.\\u201d So she puts in the DVD and a few of the ladies start doing it, but this makes me feel uncomfortable again. I leave that room and go into a different room. In this room are the teenage kids of the staff. They\\u2019re sitting around kind of bored and are starting to throw food around just for something to do. I think, \\u201cOh! I\\u2019ve got all these CDs in my wagon. Maybe that will entertain them and they\\u2019ll just sit here for a little bit.\\u201d I want to extend the time that people stay at this party because it\\u2019s warm in here. There\\u2019s a couch and there\\u2019s a little bit of food and I don\\u2019t have anywhere else I can go for the night. So, I start to sort out the CDs. I\\u2019m putting them in alphabetical order which is something I\\u2019ve never done in my entire life, but it organizes them well enough that the kids are starting to sort through them. In fact, all of them are quite occupied with this and they\\u2019re each picking out one that they like and playing it. Then one of the parents comes in and says it\\u2019s time to go. The kids start leaving one by one by one. I feel really sad. I see that it\\u2019s starting to get dark. There\\u2019s a dog in the room. I wonder because people are leaving and the dog is still there if it doesn\\u2019t belong to somebody. So, I follow it as it walks from that room into the bathroom. I see it has vomited all over the bathroom. There\\u2019s a little pile of dog shit on the counter. There\\u2019s vomit in the garbage pail. I\\u2019m wondering if the dog is sick or no one took it outside. So I'm asking people whose dog is this. Nobody claims it. More and more people are going. They don\\u2019t take any of the food with them. I\\u2019m starting to wonder if I could maybe stay there and no one would notice. I think I might as well take the risk. But what am I going to do with this dog because it\\u2019s shitting everywhere? I don\\u2019t want to go outside because I\\u2019m afraid if I go outside, I won\\u2019t be able to get back in. There's one woman left. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this your dog?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d I say to her, \\u201cCould you not take it with you, though? Wouldn\\u2019t your kids love this dog? I think it\\u2019s really sick and it needs somebody.\\u201d She agrees to take it. They leave and I\\u2019m alone in there. I\\u2019m starting to gather my CDs together in a pile. Every time I stack them, they fall. None of them will stay in a stack anymore. I take a big giant knife and cut them in half, then I cut them in half again. I put the pieces back in the wagon. I put my clothes over top, but they seem to have disappeared. I wonder if the kids have taken them. There\\u2019s only a few clothes left; it\\u2019s mostly just these pieces of CDs. While I\\u2019m sitting there, one other person comes out. He must have been in the bathroom. He asks me if I need any help. I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, I have some interesting news for you that you might want to hear.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cRemember your friend Amy?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d He says, \\u201cShe\\u2019s been accused of lying about other people\\u2019s dreams. I thought you might want to know that.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, I guess it came back around.\\u201d I\\u2019m sad for her and wonder what\\u2019s wrong with her that she does that to get attention. I guess that\\u2019s good that people know I wasn\\u2019t lying.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Courtroom\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure when this dream starts if I\\u2019m just observing and then become one of the people or if I was one of the people all along. I\\u2019m in a courthouse. I can see it from the outside - the big wide stairs, the huge pillars, the giant doors, the big spacious hallways that are made of marble, the floor is really slippery and looks wet but it is not. This is the part where I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m just observing or if I\\u2019m one of the people. In the hallway there are just a couple of people. I\\u2019m walking through it trying to find some justice. I can feel this tight ball of outrage mixed with grief in the middle of my chest. I wonder which courtroom I\\u2019m supposed to be in. as I\\u2019m looking at each door, I\\u2019m looking for some sign that this will be where my case will be heard. There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there\\u2019s four, then eight, then sixteen; they\\u2019re multiplying exponentially. Then they\\u2019re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it\\u2019s all just men. Then there are so many that there\\u2019s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They\\u2019re only inches away from me and now there\\u2019s even more. I\\u2019m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, \\u201cThese aren't regular men. Look, this man\\u2019s gay.\\u201d As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there\\u2019s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They\\u2019re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there\\u2019s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that\\u2019s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they\\u2019re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that\\u2019s the end of it. But then they regain their footing and they start to make some space again as they\\u2019re running down the next hallway. Then I\\u2019m in the crowd, I\\u2019m not just watching. I\\u2019m looking for a place where we can blend in so the people who are chasing us won\\u2019t recognize us. Or is there a door that isn\\u2019t just a courtroom but actually leads to someplace we can hide. So this goes on. The hallways are endless. There\\u2019s nowhere to blend in because someone keeps recognizing us. Then at one point, there\\u2019s enough distance between us and the people chasing us. I open one of the doors. You can hardly see that it\\u2019s a door because it\\u2019s a white door within a white wall. I open it up and run in. it\\u2019s got a push-in button lock. I can feel somebody on the other side of the door. The door handle is in my hand and I\\u2019m trying to push the button, but the person is turning the door so that the button keeps popping out. It keeps happening over and over and over again. Then I think this is it and I\\u2019m done for. Then I hear this voice on the other side saying, \\u201cPlease let me in!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAlright it\\u2019s not someone trying to chase, but someone trying to hide.\\u201d I open the door up and this big round man comes in. I think we\\u2019re not going to fit in here because he\\u2019s so big. But we do. Now he's in front of me. I think to myself that if someone opens the door, they\\u2019re not even going to see me because he\\u2019s so big he\\u2019s filling up the space. Then I can feel that his body feels soft and doughy, it\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s absorbing me. I think, \\u201cWell, at least it\\u2019s not uncomfortable.\\u201d Then I hear the crowd and the noises of the feet pounding and the yelling. They\\u2019re getting closer and closer and closer. Then they\\u2019re right outside the door. I feel them going a little away and then they\\u2019re gone in the distance. Then it\\u2019s quiet. I start to let out my breath. My heart\\u2019s pounding so hard that I can\\u2019t breathe. It starts to subside a bit. I get an inhale again. After some minutes, I\\u2019m starting to breathe again. Both of us are scared to open the door. It\\u2019s pitch dark in here because there is no justice here. It\\u2019s quiet for long enough that the building sounds empty. I think the fight has just gone on outside. It didn\\u2019t disappear, it\\u2019s somewhere. We open the door, go into the dark hallways. There\\u2019s no one in the building. It sounds like no one is in here. We walk down the hallways until we see the door back to the street. The street is dark. This other person just disappears. I\\u2019m walking and wondering where to go. Then I see one shop that looks open. It looks like a curio shop. I open the door. It has one of those cowbells on the top and makes the cowbell noise. An elderly woman comes out. She tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m over here if you need me.\\u201d She disappears into the piles and piles of stuff. I go off into the room to the right. I don\\u2019t have any money. At first it just looks like junk, broken, dusty, dirty things. I don\\u2019t even really want to sort through them. Then as I look at things more closely I think it\\u2019s not just piles of junk, but actually antique furniture. You can see where she started to decorate the furniture to make it look like a store with lamps and tablecloths and little ornaments around those. But as no one was buying anything, she\\u2019s collecting and hoarding them. Eventually you couldn\\u2019t tell where the arrangement was and where it was just things upon things upon things. But I become interested in the layers because it\\u2019s the furniture I\\u2019m trying to decipher. In one corner of one room, I\\u2019ve sorted my way into it. I\\u2019m interested in this desk because it looks like there is a secret compartment in it somewhere. So I\\u2019m moving things around, taking all this stuff off it...broken picture frames and I wonder who these people are and setting them somewhere else. I\\u2019m moving the lamps. There are too many broken things that I can\\u2019t tell what\\u2019s what. But once I move a lot of the broken stuff, I can start to see actual things. I move the lamp. There\\u2019s a kitchen utensil and it\\u2019s old enough that I don\\u2019t recognize it. I\\u2019m wondering what it was used for. Then I\\u2019ve cleared enough of the space on top of the desk that I can open it. It\\u2019s one of those roll tops that rolls back into itself. Now there\\u2019s stuff inside and it\\u2019s just crammed with stuff! So I have to move all these other things. Suddenly there\\u2019s a man beside me. I recognize him as this guy who I talked to for a little while then realized he wasn\\u2019t a very nice person so I stopped talking to him. Every word he said was so insincere. He says to me, \\u201cLook, there are two little pieces of wood at the back of this. If you lift them up, it exposes a secret compartment.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, how did you know this? There was so much stuff in front of this.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been in here for a really, really long time.\\u201d Then he goes back to sitting on the floor. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s a prisoner there and he\\u2019s trapped somehow. I\\u2019m looking to see what was in this compartment. It\\u2019s cartons, like the kind of boxes that look like shoe boxes but are made of pretty material...or maybe it\\u2019s wallpaper over cardboard. But you see older ladies with them. They wrap things in material and tissue paper so dust moths don\\u2019t eat them. There are a whole bunch of these stacked in here. I wonder if this actually belongs to the old lady who has this store. I find her. I go into the other room and find her and say, \\u201cOne of the desks in the other room has a secret compartment.\\u201d She looks at me with some surprise and affection and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019ve found it!\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell let me know if you need any help, I\\u2019ll be over here.\\u201d I think she doesn\\u2019t mind that I\\u2019m looking through all this stuff and sorting it. I go back into the first room and am thinking that it\\u2019s okay to look through all these things! I\\u2019m sorting them into different piles. I leave the desk open the way I found it. I go across the room. The man is still there and he has his eyes closed like he\\u2019s trapped. It looks like he can\\u2019t move away from that spot. In this one corner of the room, I\\u2019m sorting through things and I find this beautiful string of lights. There are only five lights on it. It looks like hand-blown glass. The blue is a beautiful color. In fact, you can see the different elements in the blue that would have been exposed when the glassblower was blowing it to make the bulb. You can see bits of orange and terracotta and different shades of this deep carnival royal blue. I\\u2019m admiring them and thinking, \\u201cWow, here\\u2019s this beautiful thing hidden amidst all of this junk.\\u201d I set them carefully aside. Now I find a picture with a round oval frame. It looks like me when I was a little girl. I set that beside the string of blue lights. I wonder what else is in here that maybe once belonged to me when I was young. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cEscape\\u201d I\\u2019m in a grey cement building. It looks like the Hoover Dam - it\\u2019s that tall and made of cement like that. It\\u2019s dark. There\\u2019s water on the floor, about an inch of it, and it feels damp and cold. I\\u2019m inside with three people. We\\u2019re taking turns sleeping in shifts. We can only sleep for a maximum of eight minutes. We\\u2019re practicing a rotation that we can take this copper wire thing and roll it up into a key. It\\u2019s kind of shaped like a paperclip. We have to take it out of its shape and roll it into two other things within a certain amount of time. One of the shapes, you take one end and it ends up looking something like a flower. And the other, I\\u2019ve already forgotten what it looks like. We\\u2019re really, really tired. Everybody wants to sleep more than we are, but we can\\u2019t because we\\u2019re training ourselves to escape this place. We\\u2019ve got this old lumpy mattress on the floor so it keeps you off the water. There\\u2019s one set of sheets. The person who\\u2019s sleeping gets to stretch out and the rest of us are just sitting on something like one of those trundle buggies or wheely carts where you put things in them for shopping and they have a handle. Homeless people use them or the elderly. So we\\u2019re sitting on that to keep us up out of the water. So you not only have to be able to snap out of your sleep quickly, you also have to be dropped into your sleep quickly. If we can do all of this within eight minutes - fall asleep, wake up, fold the wire into the two different shapes - then we\\u2019re sure we can manage our escape. Everybody has to go through the rotation and there are four of us all together. So we do this. It repeats in the dream four times. One person has a really hard time waking up and it\\u2019s making all of us anxious. We\\u2019re shaking her and saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta get up! You\\u2019ve gotta get up!\\u201d She finally wakes up. We make her go through that a couple more times so she is waking up at the proper time. When she does, we take the sheets of the bed, but we have to leave the top cover on so it looks like people are still sleeping there because there\\u2019s somebody that comes around and checks and if they realize we\\u2019re gone before we\\u2019re all the way out of the building then we might get caught. So we have to practice taking the sheet off without disturbing the top cover. I\\u2019m actually quite good at this. We do it and I\\u2019m instructing the others, telling them how to do it. We do it, fold it up and put everything in this trundle buggie and leave.\"],[\"\\u201cGoats and Ethics\\u201d I\\u2019ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I\\u2019m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I\\u2019m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, \\u201cHmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really find any. Then I decide I\\u2019m not worried about it because I\\u2019ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I\\u2019m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I\\u2019ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don\\u2019t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I\\u2019m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He\\u2019s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, \\u201cYou have to see this, come with me.\\u201d We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn\\u2019t a yard; it\\u2019s a pool of water. But it doesn\\u2019t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, \\u201cThis is just amazing. You have to see this.\\u201d We bend down and look into the lake. She says, \\u201cLook what I found.\\u201d I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it\\u2019s not made of cement; it\\u2019s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, \\u201cLook! It\\u2019s a goat path.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don\\u2019t understand how it\\u2019s for goats.\\u201d So we\\u2019re kneeling at the side and she says, \\u201cLook.\\u201d I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re post holes.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.\\u201d She presses something and they start to go up - they\\u2019re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, \\u201cAt one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.\\u201d I think, \\u201cI wonder what the value is in that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell they would have used it when they were threatened.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, then, still I don\\u2019t understand what the goats did.\\u201d Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it\\u2019s not wood that things are made of and the reason they\\u2019ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, \\u201cWow, this is incredible.\\u201d Now other students are coming out and it\\u2019s 4:30. I realize it\\u2019s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can\\u2019t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can\\u2019t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Spectre\\u201d I\\u2019m in the house on A. Street. There\\u2019s some kind of renovation going on. There are also a lot of people. I don\\u2019t understand what they\\u2019re there for. I\\u2019m circulating through the various floors and chatting with people. It\\u2019s like someone invited me to an open house and I don\\u2019t know any of the people there so I\\u2019m just casually circulating around, except that I\\u2019m completely familiar with the house. So I don\\u2019t feel as awkward as I would normally in a place where I know zero people. I\\u2019m an outsider to the conversations. So I go upstairs then I go back downstairs. I sit on the porch for a little while. I\\u2019m an outsider to that conversation. Then I go into the main floor where the living room and kitchen are, and the same thing, I\\u2019m an outsider. Then I come back outside and I sit on the front steps. I turn around because something in the conversation peaks my interest. I look at them and I see this spectre. It\\u2019s black and has not necessarily a malevolent presence, but ominous. It\\u2019s leaning against the bricks. Other peoples\\u2019 eyes are facing it, but they\\u2019re continuing on with their conversations as though it\\u2019s not there. So I think they can\\u2019t see it. It makes me feel concerned because it\\u2019s like the usher that walks you down the aisle and it feels like death is the play that\\u2019s about to start. I wonder who is it there for? Then, on the lawn, there are a lot of children starting to gather. They're just playing a game with a stick - throwing the stick and catching it. There\\u2019s a ball that they\\u2019re kicking through a hoop. Now I wander through the house again. This time instead of just meandering, I\\u2019m looking to see if there\\u2019s any imminent danger or someone that\\u2019s unwell and might need some help. I go through the floors looking for that. When I get back down to the main floor I realize I need to use the washroom. I wander over that way. There\\u2019s somebody in it, so I stand outside and wait. When he comes out, he\\u2019s quite a chatty fellow. He starts trying to engage me in conversation, but I\\u2019m very uncomfortable because my bladder feels full and it\\u2019s pressing against me and I don\\u2019t want to engage right now, I just really want to use the washroom. But he\\u2019s oblivious to this. By this time I\\u2019m hopping from one foot to the other and saying, \\u201cExcuse me, please just one moment while I use the washroom.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t stop talking. I just go in the washroom anyway and close the door. I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and he comes in as though I\\u2019m not on the toilet and just continues the conversation! He\\u2019s talking about the renovations that he\\u2019s done to the bathroom. He\\u2019s actually quite impassioned and seems oblivious to me sitting on the toilet. Now my bladder\\u2019s been relieved so I\\u2019m able to focus on what he\\u2019s saying. It\\u2019s actually really interesting how he has renovated the bathroom on a budget, but it looks quite nice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHmm, note to self, a couple of these are good ideas!\\u201d He wanders out and I finish taking care of my needs in the bathroom, washing my hands. I\\u2019m looking at how clean this bathroom is. It\\u2019s very nice but really tiny. All the grout is white and it\\u2019s got a lot of decorations, but everything is clean and dust free. I\\u2019m thinking that there\\u2019s something unusual about the man and his hair or head. He\\u2019s still standing outside the bathroom door chatting. I\\u2019m looking at his face. The skin around his face kind of grows right into his hair; he doesn't have a hairline. There is a lot of hair growing out of his ears, kind of the way a hedgehog\\u2019s face continues to grow into its fur coat. And with his stature, he looks like a hobbit. He has the engaging warm friendly countenance of the hobbits. He\\u2019s still chatting away. Now somebody else is interested in his conversation. I go back through the living room and out onto the porch. The spectre is still there. Now it\\u2019s starting to get dark; it\\u2019s twilight, but the kids are still playing and no one has come to collect them. They vary in age from five to maybe eight, so they shouldn\\u2019t be out in the dark on their own. I\\u2019m wondering who\\u2019s going to claim them. I stay. They\\u2019re still playing happily. One of them gets too close to the road. As part of the game, they lay down flat on their belly right at the edge of the road. I\\u2019m scared that a car is going to come around and not see them because they\\u2019re flat and it\\u2019s starting to get dark. I\\u2019m wondering at what point I should intervene. I\\u2019m watching for traffic and looking to see if cars are coming. In that period of time, the child gets back and goes to the lawn where it\\u2019s safe. Now there are people starting to gather at the right hand corner of the house. I see the spectre start to move. It has a scythe and suddenly the scythe gets really long and the handle is in the spectre\\u2019s hand. The spectre is reaching it up over its head and over to the other side because it looks like it\\u2019s intending to scoop someone with the scythe and blade standing there. I feel my body erupting in a big \\u201cNo!\\u201d from the center of my being and I don\\u2019t know who it\\u2019s scooping. The crowd at the side of the house meld together - the people are indistinguishable from each other and I still don\\u2019t know who it\\u2019s claimed.\"],[\"\\u201cLittle Animals with Trunks on the Movie Set\\u201d This dream starts at the restaurant where I worked while at university. It\\u2019s a continuation of another dream where I heard they were hiring and I brought my application in. It starts by me meeting there with a bunch of other people I used to hang around with when I worked there. We are meeting there and it\\u2019s a Sunday night. We\\u2019re going to see a concert and the reason we\\u2019re meeting there is because the manager or one of the bartenders (I\\u2019m not sure who) has picked up a bulk purchase of tickets and we have access to them as employees at this bulk rate. I\\u2019ve been included in this. I\\u2019m feeling hopeful that I have a job there because I\\u2019ve been included. So, it\\u2019s shift change and I'm sitting at the bar with everyone else. Some of the staff are eating, which is typical - they\\u2019re getting their meal at the end of their shift. Some staff come in earlier and eat their staff meal before their shift starts. So there are a lot of people around and it\\u2019s a festive atmosphere. The people that have finished their shift are buoyant because they\\u2019re counting their tips. The people that are starting their shift are buoyant because there\\u2019s an anticipation of the money they\\u2019re going to make. There\\u2019s always good music playing there. I see people I went to highschool with. Their uniforms are all fresh and I can tell they\\u2019ve just been hired that day. I have a conversation with two of them. The tickets go around and I take mine. We\\u2019re figuring out who\\u2019s going to carpool with who and in what car. We\\u2019re waiting for the schedule to go up because it\\u2019s Sunday night. George, the manager, disappears into the back and somebody comments that he\\u2019s taking a long time to work on it. The crowd is thinning because people have finished their meal or left with their ticket and carpool or are on the floor starting to take care of their section. I\\u2019m still waiting to see if I\\u2019m on it because I\\u2019ve been included in this. George hasn\\u2019t come out from the back yet. I ask the owner who personally gave me a package with my ticket in it. Now I remember that they also had a small birthday celebration for me. Several people have given me a birthday gift and I didn\\u2019t expect this. I ask the owner if he knows if I\\u2019m on the schedule. He says he doesn\\u2019t know. He takes my hand and then leaves. One of the other managers is standing there, so I ask him. He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He has a sad look on his face. I feel really dejected and don\\u2019t even want to go to the concert now. I\\u2019m wondering why not only everybody who used to work with me has been re-hired, but these other people that went to highschool with and who never even worked there before have been hired. I leave. I get on the bus to go home. The bus is leaving and it does go down P. Road, but it stops and I disembark. It\\u2019s not just a bus stop, it\\u2019s an intersection of all different kinds of transportation. There\\u2019s a big ship at the dock. There are skateboards. There\\u2019s a snowmobile. There are other things I don\\u2019t remember. At first I choose a skateboard and it\\u2019s interesting because it is snowing. I\\u2019m surprised that as I go up a hill with snow that I can maneuver on this - it\\u2019s a combination of pressing my right foot down, then the left foot lifts up a little, and then you use your body weight and your center of gravity to heave it forward - it\\u2019s similar to skiing. I get up this very small hill then get some momentum and it\\u2019s going along in the snow. When I look down I can see the snowmobile tracks in the snow and they\\u2019ve hardened a bit in the cold, and it\\u2019s actually helping my skateboard to move along. I do this for a little while then get off the skateboard. Now I\\u2019m on some other kind of vehicle. It\\u2019s flying over the snow and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It has a steering mechanism. I am zooming along. It\\u2019s wide and there are a couple other people on it. I look over to the side and there are trees flying by. I can see an animal through the trees. I can\\u2019t figure out what kind of animal it is. At first I think it\\u2019s a warthog. Then I think it\\u2019s too big to be a warthog. Then I get a better glimpse of it. You know when things are speeding by and at first you can\\u2019t see something but then it\\u2019s almost like the thing that are speeding by are so fast that it looks like a motion picture and you can see what the other object is? It looks like a hippopotamus except it has wings and a trunk. Then I see all these other strange pictures. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow! This is the set from a Harry Potter movie!\\u201d I get excited about this. We get off at the next stop. Now my son is there and he gets off with me. I say, \\u201cDid you see that?!\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe animal through the trees!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, what did you see?!\\u201d I describe the process of first thinking it was a warthog then realizing what it was. He says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go take a look at the set!\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYou know what? If that\\u2019s the movie set, then we could actually rewatch that movie and look carefully at that scene through the trees and maybe see us flying by.\\u201d He gets really excited about this, too, and we decide to do that when we get home. Then we walk back the way we came on the vehicle. It\\u2019s taking us a little while to walk because we need to go back to that intersection of vehicles in order to get on one that will take us home. We\\u2019re almost there. We\\u2019re walking down the little hill that I skateboarded up with the snow. Then we decide to go off to the left and see if we can see anything else from the movie set. We get closer to it and there are extras and the caterers and those kinds of people milling about and doing their thing. There\\u2019s a commotion. We follow along with the crowd so we can see what the commotion is about. It\\u2019s a horse and it\\u2019s kicking another horse. I\\u2019m horrified. It\\u2019s just awful. I can hear the people on the set gasping and saying, \\u201cTake that thing out of the horse costume!\\u201d What\\u2019s happening is one of these trunked creatures is dressed up as a horse and the other horse thinks that the first horse\\u2019s spirit is bad so it\\u2019s kicking it because it doesn\\u2019t understand it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s another creature in it. They get the first horse calmed down and they remove the horse skin from the other one and put it into this pen. But the pen is a pit. There are a whole bunch of them in it and it\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s so inhumane. They\\u2019re all writhing around and all you can see are these little trunks. It\\u2019s so awful I wake up because I can\\u2019t stand looking at this or seeing this.\"],[\"\\u201cMessage\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house. On the kitchen table are two notepads in a wicker basket. They have an eclectic assortment of many notes I made while I was on the phone, little lists, self-reminders, passwords, numbers. One is entirely all of this. I\\u2019m almost at the end of blank paper in it. I look through both of them to make sure everything has been covered or written down somewhere else or put where it\\u2019s supposed to be. One of them is like this and I know I can throw it away. The other one has a note in the middle of it. I can\\u2019t remember all of it, but there was the word, \\u201cisa\\u201d or \\u201cesa\\u201d with three numbers above and three numbers below. I can\\u2019t throw this one away; I have to keep it. In fact, I\\u2019ve been meaning to tear out just that one piece of paper because it\\u2019s proof. What it\\u2019s proof of, I\\u2019m not sure. But in the dream, my biological mother has been telling lies about me. It\\u2019s abusive. None of it is true. I\\u2019ve done a lot of self-healing and self-parenting around that and accepted that she will always tell those kinds of lies and there will be some who believe her, but I\\u2019ve moved on and am living my own life. But when I go through these notebooks, I see this one note and am shocked to see it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this proves that i was telling the truth!\\u201d So this is why I do suddenly want to keep this note even though I hadn\\u2019t thought of all those wrongs she did to me in so long. Somebody comes along and moves the basket around and takes the notebooks before I\\u2019ve had a chance to put this one notebook in my pocket. I\\u2019m trying to find out who moved them and what they did with them. There are renovations being done in the next room in the house - the living room. There\\u2019s a man in there wearing white coveralls - the type that painters wear. He\\u2019s up on a ladder and he\\u2019s starting to cut in the edges around the ceiling with the brush the way painters do before they use the roller to the walls. I notice that he\\u2019s got the top half of a toolbox - like the red metal toolboxes people carry around with the insert you can lift out with a handle and some of the heavier tools stay in the bottom. He has this, but instead of it being full of screwdrivers and whatnot, he\\u2019s cemented up the carrying part of it so all that\\u2019s accessible is just this handle. I ask him, \\u201cHave you seen the notebooks from the kitchen?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh yeah, they\\u2019re in that basket over there.\\u201d I look and he\\u2019s pointing to the insert from the red metal toolbox that\\u2019s been cemented up. I say, \\u201cHow long ago did you do this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cEh, about five or ten minutes.\\u201d I ask him if the cement is still wet enough that I can break it open and get my notes out of there because I really need one of them. He\\u2019s indifferent and says, \\u201cEh, you can if you want. I don\\u2019t care.\\u201d Then he continues his cutting with the paintbrush. I\\u2019m indecisive. I think if it\\u2019s in there, it\\u2019s in there forever and the cement is going to harden momentarily. Then I decide that I do want them. So I look around for something to break the cement with. He has a putty knife with a wide blade. I\\u2019m pressing it into the top where the two seams meet. The cement is still kind of wet. I get both notebooks out and am looking through both of them. I don\\u2019t see the one note anymore. I go through them again. It\\u2019s still not there. Then I go through them again, really slowly, one page at a time. It\\u2019s painstaking; it\\u2019s tedious. I\\u2019m starting to feel frustrated with this. I can\\u2019t remember if I find it or not.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and it seems like some kind of celebration. It almost feels like a Christmas Open House or an informal reception of some sort. I\\u2019m wandering through the house looking for somebody I know. I don't see anybody when I go through the first three rooms. When I get to the backroom, I see my friend Kenny. He\\u2019s sitting with one of his sisters and both of his parents. I\\u2019m comfortable with them so I stay there. I don\\u2019t mingle. I just have conversations in turn with each of them until the event starts to wind down and the crowd starts to thin. Kenny leaves. I\\u2019m still taking to his sister; we\\u2019re having a bonding conversation about being the mother of boys. It\\u2019s time for her to go home and it\\u2019s just the parents left. They ask me if I would like a ride and I accept. I get into the car. I don\\u2019t know what happens to the mom, maybe we dropped her off earlier. I\\u2019m in the car now with the dad. He says to me, \\u201cIs it okay if we stop somewhere because I need to pick something up?\\u201d He tells me where it is and I say, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s only five minutes from my house.\\u201d We pull up and it\\u2019s a really tall apartment building. There\\u2019s a circular approach to it and he pulls up the car to the front of the main door. Then he says, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize you can\\u2019t park here. If I stay in the car while it\\u2019s running, do you mind going up and getting the parcel?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d He describes to me the floor that it\\u2019s on and tells me that I have to go down to the end of the hallway and it\\u2019s the last door on the right. He says it should be open. I follow the instructions and end up where he tells me. The door is open. I go into the hallway and see a parcel there and it\\u2019s bright orange, the kind of orange you\\u2019d see on a construction site. I pick up the parcel and exit the door backwards. I leave my left arm in the doorway, so it doesn\\u2019t make a loud noise as it closes. I\\u2019m starting to feel strange about being in somebody\\u2019s apartment when I don't know them and picking something up when I don\\u2019t know what it is. I\\u2019m walking down the hallway feeling kind of edgy. I see two people coming towards me from the end of the hallway. I overhear snippets of their conversation and realize they live in the apartment I just exited. I take note of what they look like. It\\u2019s a man and a woman. The woman is wearing a long nice pretty dress. They are both brown skin. Her hair is dark and pulled back in a bun. As I start to go down the stairs I\\u2019m feeling really unsure about what I\\u2019ve just done. When I get to the car, I share this with the dad. Before he answers or addresses my concerns, I see on the front seat of the car a folded up front page of a newspaper. The picture on it is a picture of my face as I\\u2019m running away from a building and the headline is \\u201cThis Place Has Been Robbed!\\u201d Now I am really distressed. I\\u2019m asking him. He told me it was okay what\\u2019s going on here but while I\\u2019m talking, he starts driving quickly away. Out from the underground parking lot comes a great big bright yellow ocre Cadillac. It\\u2019s the kind of Cadillac really old people drive. It\\u2019s really long and wide and doesn\\u2019t fit in parking spots anymore. I can see through the front windshield, the same man and woman I met in the hallway. I can hear the sound of the engine of the car roaring to live. It\\u2019s driving really quickly. They\\u2019re tearing up the road behind us. The dad speeds up and says he thinks he can lose them. He drives through the downtown to the other side of the city where there is a suburban area. It\\u2019s a quieter place. You can feel the quiet. It\\u2019s dark, nighttime. We drive up a really steep hill and he tells me to get out here and I'll be safe. I don\\u2019t know where I am in regards to my own house. I know I don\\u2019t feel safe, yet he doesn\\u2019t even turn the car off and everything happens so quickly that I feel like I have to get out now and don\\u2019t have time to ask questions because the time we gained on the car chasing us might be lost. I feel threatened as if my life is at stake. On the way I told him I wanted to go to the police. I don\\u2019t remember if he replied. Everything was happening so quickly. I get out of the car. I don't have the package - it\\u2019s not mine and I didn\\u2019t want it. I go in between two buildings - it's a really narrow asphalt pathway. Once I get behind the buildings, I\\u2019m in a square courtyard with all these big houses backed onto it. I\\u2019m standing there in the dark. It\\u2019s a quiet cushy kind of feeling there. I think, \\u201cAlright, I gotta get my bearings. I don\\u2019t have anything with me. How can I get the police and explain what actually happened because I\\u2019m being wrongly accused of something I was tricked into doing. Where is a phone? It\\u2019s nighttime. I need somewhere to sleep but I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019ll be safe.\\u201d My eyes adjust to the dark and I see I\\u2019m at the top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill is the woman from the hallway and in the car. She looks at me and I can tell that she recognizes me. She looks like she\\u2019s getting ready to run up the hill. But I have momentum on my side, so I run down the hill faster and faster and faster. My idea is to tackle her, to take her out, and then keep running until no one can find me. But she guesses what I\\u2019m going to do and ducks under. I roll through the air and we both land on our feet. We\\u2019re squaring off at each other, circling around and around. This is where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Accommodations\\u201d I\\u2019m by the bay, but it\\u2019s not the bay I normally sail from; there is grass around the banks. But it\\u2019s still a place where people tie up their boats and get out and into their cars. It kind of looks like a marina in Wilson, New York. My friend has her boat there and she\\u2019s sitting at a picnic table with a few other people. There is a riding lawn mower and I get on it because I\\u2019ve never sat on one before. She says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you start it up?\\u201d I say, \\u201cIs it okay?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYeah, just start it up the way you would a car.\\u201d I see a key in the ignition and I start it. The engine turns over, it\\u2019s on, and we\\u2019re moving forward. At first i\\u2019m just driving it on the grass, just getting used to it. It looks like the grass has been freshly cut, so I\\u2019m not making any marks on the grass with it. Then, there\\u2019s something in the middle of the grass on a slope - a garden. I see that the grass is taller around the garden and now the lawn mower is leaving marks. So I think it would be irresponsible of me just to have driven this around haphazardly and to ruin the look of it. So I start going up and down the grassed area in an organized way. I\\u2019m trying to get close to the garden without cutting the flowers. My friend has now gotten out and gone back to her boat for something. We finished eating at the picnic tables and she\\u2019s tidying that stuff up. I realize I need to put the lawn mower back where I found it. There are a couple of spots that look really, really bad now because I didn\\u2019t quite finish going up and down properly. So I\\u2019m trying to cut across with those spots close to the garden and there\\u2019s another one a bit further away. I think I do this...I don\\u2019t remember turning the lawn mower off or parking it somewhere. The next thing I remember is I\\u2019m in a car. It\\u2019s pulling up outside an apartment building and I\\u2019ve been sleeping in it. I\\u2019m really, really, really tired. I\\u2019m in the backseat. Luke is driving. The car stops in front of the apartment building. A few moments later, a boy comes down and he opens the door to the backseat. This is strange because the front seat is empty and I thought he would have sat in the front, but he doesn\\u2019t. He sits in the back and now I can\\u2019t sleep, so I sit up. He\\u2019s laughing at me for sleeping or being in the back seat. He thinks it\\u2019s really funny. It\\u2019s Luke\\u2019s son and I can tell because they have the exact same face. We drive over to Lynn\\u2019s house and pull up in the driveway and get out. Luke disappears into the house. I go into the garage, but I go in through the front door. I\\u2019ve been gradually moving my stuff over there. Lynn has agreed to lend me her garage for a little while because I have nowhere to live. My son and I are staying there for a little bit. We have piled up cardboard boxes all over the garage. I\\u2019ve arranged them in a way so they form almost a full wall. I\\u2019ve left a little bit of space between the top of the boxes and top of the garage so light comes in from the rest of the garage. It gives us a place of privacy and a little bit of darkness if we want to sleep. Some time passes by, like three or four weeks. On the other half of the garage, Lynn has set up a gym/spa. She has machines and a room made of cedar strips that you can go in. There's an interesting way of making the cedar room into a sauna by pouring a cup of water into a drawer and then closing the drawer, then out of the spout comes steam. There\\u2019s another that releases steam practically through the whole house. She calls that one the steam room and the one with the drawer, the sauna. I run into Luke again - he\\u2019s her boyfriend - and he\\u2019s in there. He says to me: \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to move out because you can't live here for free.\\u201d I feel embarrassed, shocked and surprised that he said this because when I first moved here when Lynn offered, she said it was okay to live there and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m there. My job has ended but it was six weeks until I got my payment from it and she said it was okay to pay her rent money at the six week mark when my payments all come in. so, this is why I\\u2019m feeling embarrassed, shocked and surprised. I wonder why she told him that I\\u2019m living there for free and why he thinks he has to be the muscle and tell me instead of her. So, I leave the spa/gym area on the other half of the garage and go into our boxed off area. I tell my son, \\u201cI think we have to leave.\\u201d It\\u2019s the five and a half week mark and only four more days until I\\u2019m supposed to get my money. But I don\\u2019t know where else we can go. This is confusing because I don\\u2019t know if we just stay for four days or if the dream speeds ahead for four days and we stay there. My money does come in when it\\u2019s supposed to. It\\u2019s like the money came in an envelope or maybe I went to a bank. I have the money and I\\u2019m sorting it out on the floor where I was sleeping. I have a little sleeping bag there. I\\u2019m putting the money in piles and saying: \\u201cThis is for that debt and this is for that debt.\\u201d Then I count out Lynn\\u2019s money. I go into the house and she\\u2019s in the kitchen sitting at the table with Luke. I glare at him and then put the money in front of her and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s your six weeks of rent just like we agreed.\\u201d I don\\u2019t stay and talk to her. I turn around and leave the kitchen. My son and I are packing up our stuff. I don\\u2019t know where we are going but we\\u2019re just not staying there because of how that situation was construed to feel horrible instead of something helpful.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Spare Room\\u201d This dream is situated in the house that I lied in with my daughter, only it\\u2019s empty and I\\u2019m the age I am now. I\\u2019m moving into it with two girlfriends that I currently work with at the yoga studio. It\\u2019s move-in day but we don\\u2019t have any furniture, so we\\u2019re doing a walk-through. We look through the main floor. It looks clean. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one for everyone. The bathroom looks like it\\u2019s in good shape. They stay up on the top floor. They\\u2019re looking around in the bedrooms for some specific measurements or something. I go down into the basement. Although the basement looks clean and dry, there\\u2019s something creepy in it; it\\u2019s an energy that I feel. I walk over to the sliding patio glass doors. I look behind the blinds. I see an old man there. He\\u2019s gardening. I ask him if he needs anything. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m good thanks.\\u201d He\\u2019s in the backyard on the other side of the glass and I\\u2019m on the inside. I look down to see what he\\u2019s doing. He has a toolbox and he\\u2019s fixing something. I ask him if he\\u2019s going to need to come into the house. He replies in a voice like, \\u201cOh no no, I would never go in there.\\u201d I think he knows something about this creepy energy in the basement. Then I go back upstairs to the main floor. The other two girls are starting to bring in boxes and furniture. I\\u2019m helping with that, bringing in my own stuff. We each set up our bedrooms then go downstairs. They\\u2019re having trouble arranging the furniture in the living room. A couple pieces are mine, a couple pieces belong to each one of them and we\\u2019re just trying to group them together. I look at what they have and say, \\u201cHmm, it\\u2019s funny that this won\\u2019t fit because when I used to live here, I had the same pieces of furniture and they all fit just fine.\\u201d So we keep rearranging and put the couch on another wall and arranging the other stuff around it. We try this on three different walls when I say, \\u201cWait a minute, I know why this isn\\u2019t fitting! That one wall that goes from the main hallway downstairs to the stairs that go up is shorter than it used to be! What\\u2019s going on with that?\\u201d So I open the door to the closet. Now there\\u2019s a closet on that same wall. For some reason we haven\\u2019t put anything in it, nor did we open it when we did our inspection. I open it up and it\\u2019s giant. Then I close it again and look on the outside of the wall and say, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s why nothing will fit there! Somebody has removed part of the wall in order to make this closet twice as large.\\u201d Then we open the closet door again and this time there is a single bed, a dresser, and a couple of low tables in there. There\\u2019s a light from the ceiling. I say, \\u201cI wonder if they had this set up as an Airbnb room?\\u201d One of the other girls says, \\u201cOr maybe they just needed an extra bedroom?\\u201d Then we close the closet door again. I notice that there is a clothing bar running down the length of the ceiling. I think I say out loud, \\u201cI wonder where we can put our coats?\\u201d Then between the three of us we decide that since we only each have one coat, we can find room for it in our own closets upstairs. Then I open the closet door one more time because I want to check the workmanship to see if this has been a hack job or if it will stay as another bedroom. I\\u2019m kind of entertaining the idea of an Airbnb room in mind. But this time when I open it up there\\u2019s a little tiny crib along with the single bed and dresser. I\\u2019m wondering what happened to this person or the baby. It kind of looks like they still live here. Then I\\u2019m starting to wonder if there\\u2019s a connection between that and the presence in the basement that I feel. I\\u2019m still thinking about this as I go back upstairs to unpack more things in the bedroom. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cDestruction of Kittens\\u201d The snippets of the dream I remember of last night are of being outside. I\\u2019m an observer. I\\u2019m watching leopards, I think, stalking each other and just generally exist in the undergrowth of the forest floor, like a rain forest. There are vines growing between trees and a lot of colors of underbrush. It\\u2019s quite lush. There are blooms, as well. The trees are tall and thin. I can see these large cats stalking each other in the shadows of the trees and pouncing playfully as cats do. Then I look from straight ahead to the left, so my head is turned about ninety degrees of what it just was. I see in the undergrowth a nest of kittens, really young, the kind that aren\\u2019t up and running yet, but folded in upon each other and sleeping as a unit. There are four of them. I\\u2019m aware that the mama is closeby but she\\u2019s stalking something. I just watch them sleeping. You can see the belly breaths, the way all babies do when they sleep breathe. I\\u2019ve missed a snippet. The next thing I notice is this long vine that\\u2019s being whipped back and forth so it\\u2019s really tight. It\\u2019s without discretion cutting everything it comes in contact with as it whips back and forth. It crosses over the nest of kittens and they are destroyed, splattered all over the area.\"],[\"\\u201cRe-living the Move\\u201d I\\u2019m re-living what I\\u2019ve been doing this last week, which is helping my daughter move from a big house into a tiny apartment. I\\u2019m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m in the kitchen and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m up in the attic and there\\u2019s stuff there. There\\u2019s a whole other apartment\\u2019s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she\\u2019s ever had since she was a kid and it\\u2019s all just everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess and it\\u2019s not sorted. She hasn\\u2019t packed any of it into boxes and she\\u2019s asking me to help her, but she\\u2019s not ready. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I\\u2019m in the attic and my friend is there. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s helping, she\\u2019s just sitting there and she\\u2019s talking. Her mood is light and she\\u2019s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They\\u2019re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They\\u2019re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I\\u2019m reaching in and at first I\\u2019m pulling out things that are just garbage and I\\u2019m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn\\u2019t belong with the toys. My friend says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and she says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let\\u2019s do it!\\u201d She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn\\u2019t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don\\u2019t really want to do this because I won\\u2019t be present for what I\\u2019m packing. Then I realize that maybe that\\u2019s silly because I\\u2019m just packing and maybe I don\\u2019t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn\\u2019t really affect me. It actually tastes like water, so that\\u2019s kind of strange.\"],[\"\\u201cBoard Games and Cereal\\u201d I\\u2019m leaving my house with a board game. It\\u2019s resting against my hip and I\\u2019ve got my left hand around the box to keep it closed. I\\u2019m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It\\u2019s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn\\u2019t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven\\u2019t fallen out. It\\u2019s old and the box doesn\\u2019t hold it\\u2019s shape very well because it\\u2019s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I\\u2019m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There\\u2019s somebody else but I can\\u2019t remember who it is now. We don\\u2019t have any front steps and it\\u2019s like a ramp. It actually feels like I\\u2019ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a long line of stores. We\\u2019re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there\\u2019s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there\\u2019s somebody else I know. They\\u2019re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don\\u2019t have masks on either. I note this and say, \\u201cWell, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!\\u201d We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I\\u2019m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, \\u201cThe cash register is over there and you have to line up.\\u201d Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they\\u2019re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They\\u2019re giving me cash. It\\u2019s not debit. I\\u2019m questioning this. The store owner comes back having finished organizing what she wanted to organize. She says, \\u201cThank you so much, I can take it from here.\\u201d I pick up my board game again. I see Julie, who I used to work with at the restaurant. I realize I\\u2019m wearing a hat, glasses and a mask and she\\u2019s probably not going to recognize me. She\\u2019s talking to somebody else I know who calls me over into the conversation. I say, \\u201cDo you know who I am?\\u201d She\\u2019s looking like she might. I take my hat off first and then I just take one of the loops of the mask from my ear quickly. She says my name and I put the mask and hat back on. She gives me a big hug and says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen you in so long.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019ve aged. You look fantastic.\\u201d I wait. She tells me about her life. This goes on for a little bit. I wonder if she\\u2019s going to tell me about her three boys. She tells me she\\u2019s in a new relationship. We say goodbye and she leaves. I notice that a piece from the board game, a house, is moving. It\\u2019s escaped from the box and is flying around. I shout this: \\u201cOh no! The house piece is on the move!\\u201d My kids are trying to catch it. They crawl underneath a cart that shopkeepers put out on the sidewalk for the day - it has legs and a bin and is made of wire. They\\u2019re crawling under these and one of them catches the piece and puts it back in the box. I\\u2019m feeling like we\\u2019ve been gone from the house too long. We turn around and start to make our way back home. I see somebody else on the sidewalk. There\\u2019s a stand up display that a man is hiding behind. He\\u2019s peeking to the person standing on the sidewalk. The person on the sidewalk is describing to us a little fearfully that somebody is spying on them. I don\\u2019t understand why they\\u2019re scared because it\\u2019s just somebody looking at them through a natural gap between the displays. I approach the guy that\\u2019s been accused of spying and say, \\u201cHey, how are you?\\u201d He says he\\u2019s good and he says, \\u201cLook. I can see the entire street through this little tiny gap.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s amazing.\\u201d He\\u2019s got pajamas over his clothes, but just the legs of pajamas. He\\u2019s wearing them like chaps, only they don\\u2019t have a belt. I say, \\u201cThis is interesting, what you have on your legs. May I ask what the purpose of it is?\\u201d He tells me it\\u2019s just a creative idea he had for dressing and he just likes it that way. It\\u2019s not for protection or anything like that. I say, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s very interesting.\\u201d Now the other person who was freaking out and accusing him of spying has been deflated and has stopped having a fit about it. The person that was accused, he was walking around and describing how he made these pajama bottom legs. He\\u2019s not peeking through the thing anymore. I guess that\\u2019s why the other person is okay now. Pajama-bottoms guy walks the opposite way and the other person continues across the street. Then I notice that the pieces of the board game are moving, they\\u2019re vibrating a lot. I\\u2019m saying to my kids, \\u201cWe really have to get home now or we\\u2019re going to lose control of these things and they\\u2019re going to fly out all over the place.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying that, the house piece flies out again. It goes way underneath this great big long outdoor bin of a different store. It goes far enough underneath that there are cobwebs. I\\u2019m not fantastically excited about chasing it under here but I do because the game is useless without that piece. I saw it go under there but it\\u2019s really dark. I feel around with my hand and there\\u2019s only one thing that\\u2019s not first so I grab it. It doesn\\u2019t look like the house piece anymore - it\\u2019s flat and not moving. I go back under there again to check around for anything else and there\\u2019s not. I put the piece in the box and am feeling like it\\u2019s not the piece. I\\u2019m already wondering where we\\u2019re going to get another one of those pieces. I know that we can\\u2019t. We continue on towards the house. There\\u2019s a guy I dated for a little while lingering around the outside. He\\u2019s trying to engage with my family. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t talk to him. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near us.\\u201d I don\\u2019t speak to him. He\\u2019s acting like I did. He\\u2019s smiling and being oblivious. He\\u2019s walking with my family. I\\u2019m getting really annoyed because he\\u2019s dense and acting like someone welcomed him in when nobody did. He follows us up the ramp and now he\\u2019s in the house. I\\u2019m ignoring him. He\\u2019s at my back. I set the board game down on the table. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says, \\u201cHere, if you put this on, it will take away all the pain from your neck, shoulders and back.\\u201d I look down and at first it looks like the thing a catcher wears in a baseball game. It\\u2019s made of this dark blue rough cotton stuff, like something a priestess would wear. It\\u2019s over my clothes. He\\u2019s pulling the drawstrings at the back tightly - they\\u2019re laces - the way someone would lace up the back of a corset. It\\u2019s very constricting and makes my arms stick out awkwardly by my side. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t want this. Can you please just get out of the house? You don\\u2019t live here. This is not your place.\\u201d He lies down on the couch and goes to sleep. I\\u2019m poking at him and he won\\u2019t move. I don\\u2019t know how to deal with this. I\\u2019m looking for my daughter to ask her if she can take these laces off and get me out of this thing. I go upstairs and there\\u2019s been a whole pile of people up there with a whole bunch of kids. They\\u2019ve gotten into everything. They\\u2019ve pulled it all out. I get the vacuum out and start vacuuming things up. You know when there\\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff in the rug and you can hear it clicking as it goes up the vacuum tube? I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019ll have to clean all this up with my hands. I start doing this. I realize there\\u2019s more furniture than will fit in the rooms and there\\u2019s stuff all over the floor. I\\u2019m trying to sort it out and figure out what goes in what room and what we really need. We need something to put towels in and there\\u2019s nothing in the bathroom and no cabinet. Where are we going to put all the towels? I go into my room. There\\u2019s stuff all over the floor! There\\u2019s this three year old kid and I don\\u2019t know who she belongs to. She\\u2019s dumped everything out onto the carpet. I pick it up and put it in bags. I think I\\u2019ve got as much as i can with my hands and start to run the vacuum. When I lift up the bedskirt to vacuum under the bed, the vacuum won\\u2019t go any further. I bend down and look. There are bags of oatmeal cereal that have been poured out and dumped. The oatmeal is eight inches thick. It\\u2019s all underneath the bed. My daughter comes in and knows I\\u2019m upset. She says, \\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cCan you please just keep picking this stuff up off the floor? Look, the vacuum isn\\u2019t even getting it all out.\\u201d Somebody has taken this black soil from a plant and it\\u2019s slightly wet so even when the vacuum goes over, it leaves a black stain everywhere. I\\u2019m overwhelmed with all the stuff that isn\\u2019t useful and is not in place and the people who aren\\u2019t listening to me and are in my house.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Studio\\u201d I\\u2019m at the studio where I teach. It\\u2019s set up differently, though. The front of the building extends way out into the street and instead of just having a glass front, three of the sides are glass so it\\u2019s a lot more transparent and visible to people walking by. Before it always felt like a sanctuary with natural brick walls and the glass front and wood floors. In this dream it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. I\\u2019m standing at the front desk which is a lot bigger. One of the owners is there. The back hallway that normally leads into the studio is now a back entrance, so people are coming in the back entrance as well. There\\u2019s more than one studio now with two doors. I see my ex-husband and a bunch of his high school friends. They\\u2019re walking like a clump of high school age guys, pushing each other playfully and stuff like that. They walk in without checking in at the desk because they\\u2019re all self-absorbed. They just go down the hall into the studio. The owner is trying to piece together their names and check off their memberships for them. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh great, they\\u2019re going to be in my class that I\\u2019m about to teach in a half hour.\\u201d I\\u2019m mentally rearranging my sequence so I can make it more physical because guys that age need that in order to focus and be present. So I\\u2019m just standing there in my head for a few minutes. Then a bunch of people come in through the back behind me. They\\u2019re also really loud. I don\\u2019t get to finish processing how I\\u2019m going to change my class in my head. They\\u2019re asking questions about the kids class. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cKids class? We don\\u2019t have kids yoga.\\u201d My answer surprised them a little. They're talking amongst themselves. I look at the time and see that it\\u2019s time for me to teach my class. I go across to the hall and am starting my music. I go into the door and instead of a whole bunch of people lying on their mats, there\\u2019s a teacher from the jujitsu studio standing at the front and a whole bunch of eight year olds. I notice the room is really hot not because it\\u2019s a hot class but because there\\u2019s been so much body heat in there working really hard. It hits me like a wall when I open the door. I go back to the desk and say to the owner: \\u201cDo we have kids yoga?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t reply. She\\u2019s already engaging with the group that had come in from the back and discussing the kids yoga with them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, hmm, I guess they do.\\u201d Then I wait for her to finish her conversation with them. I say, \\u201cI don't know where my class is. The room is full of other people and kids.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh they\\u2019re supposed to have finished five minutes ago.\\u201d I go back to the door and this time they see me because I\\u2019m standing with the door open. The teacher says, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll just be five more minutes.\\u201d I open the door fully and turn to look at the back of the room. I see my whole class practically sitting on top of each other. They don\\u2019t have their mats rolled out. My ex-husband is there with his gang. They\\u2019re all wrestling, piled on top of each other. Now it\\u2019s fifteen minutes past the time I was supposed to teach. I go back out to the desk. I tell the studio owner that it\\u2019s disrespectful to not follow the guidelines when you\\u2019re supposed to start and stop a class. She sighs, kind of dejectedly. Then we start talking about an energy exchange. She says, \\u201cWe both need it. I can give you a hot stone massage and I\\u2019m really in need of a thai massage.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that sounds like a really good idea.\\u201d We don\\u2019t deal with the problem of the room stuffed with people. The dream skips over and we\\u2019re trying to set up one of the rooms in the back hallway for the energy exchange. But as soon as we get into the room, the group of kids yoga is exiting and they\\u2019re all over the place. I realize I have to go into teach and say, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m sorry, I can\\u2019t actually do the energy exchange, I have to go teach.\\u201d I go into teach. The group changed all the playlist around so I\\u2019m trying to figure out where mine is because now it\\u2019s playing hard rock. I do that. I put the quiet song on. I do manage to get everyone onto their mats and I start to teach my class. The dream blips. I don\\u2019t remember teaching the entirety of my class. When I come back out to the desk, the studio owner tells me she can\\u2019t do the energy exchange because she has a baseball game to go to now. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ask you to come all the way in on a Saturday for this.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she\\u2019s being kind of passive aggressive about this because her tone of voice and body language imply that she does want me to come in on a Saturday for this. I think I don't. I say, \\u201cWell is there any other Monday that you would be available? I could come in a little earlier before I teach.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, I have baseball on all of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she obviously knew that when we talked about an energy exchange so she really did mean to exchange on a Saturday. I decline the Saturday and leave the building. I start trudging through the stone and guess I\\u2019m going home. I get part way there and I see my ex-sister-in-law\\u2019s two dogs. I forget their names, they\\u2019re a specialty breed and look kind of like poodles or labradoodles, medium sized-dogs. I see them in the snow. One is more of a carmel color and the other is more white. The carmel color one is having trouble walking through the snow. It\\u2019s stopping and the snow plow hasn\\u2019t come by yet. They think they\\u2019re in a snow bank but they\\u2019re actually in the middle of the road. I pick up the carmel colored one and the white one is still running through. I forget their names so I\\u2019m just calling it, \\u201cCome on! Come on you can do this!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to encourage it to go back over to the sidewalk. I\\u2019m going to walk the dogs home. The one I\\u2019m carrying is kind of heavy and my feet and legs feel heavy because of the snow. I look behind me for one second and then I don\\u2019t see the white one anymore. I look back the way I came and it\\u2019s lying down in the middle of the road. At first I think it\\u2019s dead. I touch it and it responds and it\\u2019s still warm, so it\\u2019s not dead. Now I\\u2019ve got both of the dogs in my arms and am trying to hold them under my arms like two footballs. They\\u2019re obviously sick and not well. I\\u2019m worried that their life is beginning to blink out. I\\u2019m struggling with them as I go down the sidewalk into the Co-op. It\\u2019s funny because she never lived there, but her twin sister did. I get stuck. There\\u2019s a community yard sale going on. I notice where the office used to be is a sign that now says, \\u201cSeneca College.\\u201d It\\u2019s now an office where they are trying to recruit teenagers from the Co-op directly into the college. I think that\\u2019s a pretty good idea. I\\u2019m trying to walk up the sidewalk towards her unit. There\\u2019s another dog and it\\u2019s a whippet - a racing dog with a long pointy nose. It\\u2019s snarling and growling aggressively as if it\\u2019s going to attack the other two dogs. I\\u2019ve got them in my arms and they\\u2019re not responding. They\\u2019re barely breathing. I tell this group of teenagers: \\u201cCan you please go ahead of me so there are people between that dog and these because it\\u2019s going to attack. They oblige. They do and are really nice about it. But we\\u2019re moving really slowly. I finally get to her door and knock on it and say, \\u201cLook who I found.\\u201d She\\u2019s so grateful and I say, \\u201cOh, you live beside where I live!\\u201d Now it\\u2019s twenty years ago and I\\u2019m apparently living in the same unit I lived in when my daughter was little. She gets the dogs back and puts them in a specialty bed she made for them. She\\u2019s a nurse and is looking after them and everything seems to be fine.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sound\\u201d I\\u2019m on my way or coming from somewhere. I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven\\u2019t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We\\u2019re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It\\u2019s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can\\u2019t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they\\u2019re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it\\u2019s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they\\u2019re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn\\u2019t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, \\u201cYes, I know. I don\\u2019t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, are you coming for Trina\\u2019s fiftieth birthday?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t know about that, but maybe.\\u201d She writes the date down and tells me it\\u2019s going to be on April first. When she\\u2019s writing this down I say, \\u201cYou know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn\\u2019t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll put my phone number down here, too.\\u201d She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have yours either.\\u201d She gives me another piece of paper, it\\u2019s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I\\u2019m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it\\u2019s so small that there isn\\u2019t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, \\u201cHmm, there\\u2019s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d While she\\u2019s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I\\u2019m doing this, she says to me, \\u201cHave you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they\\u2019re trying to change things in this town.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow they must really have their work cut out for them because there\\u2019s so much dark horribleness in this place.\\u201d She\\u2019s telling me that there\\u2019s a movement against them coming in. I just say, \\u201cNo, I didn\\u2019t know about either one.\\u201d Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I\\u2019m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I\\u2019m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I\\u2019ve asked her for a drink of water which I\\u2019ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it\\u2019s windy and they\\u2019re blowing open. So I\\u2019m trying to pee as I\\u2019m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it\\u2019s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, \\u201cCome back anytime.\\u201d I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there\\u2019s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way. I just press his phone number to see if he\\u2019s home because I don\\u2019t want to go out there if he isn\\u2019t. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Baby\\u201d I\\u2019m in an arena, the kind where people have hockey games and figure skating competitions. I\\u2019m carrying a baby, maybe about 4-6 months old. I\\u2019m walking around the arena. I see one of the managers from the restaurant where I used to work, Blake. I don\\u2019t approach him yet. I go into one of the change rooms. Nobody is in it. I see one of those dropdown beds that you push into the wall. I drop it down and I lie down on it with my baby and I begin to nurse her. I finish that. She\\u2019s happy and fed. I put her in a sling attached to my body and open the arena door and go out onto the ice. I\\u2019m skating. I skate around and around and around. I\\u2019m enjoying myself. The baby is liking this, too - I can see her smiling face inside her hat and she\\u2019s laughing. A good deal of time passes and I think that\\u2019s enough. We go back and I open the heavy arena door, it\\u2019s kind of hard with a baby in a sling in front of my body. I step down a step and go back to the change room. I stop because Blake comes in the door and tells me that I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that in the arena without something from the drug store, I can\\u2019t remember what. I say, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t realize that.\\u201d So, I put my coat back on and the baby is still in the sling. We walk out of the arena, down the long ramp, down a few blocks to the drug store. I\\u2019m in the drug store and looking at all these baby products. I think I don\\u2019t need any of these things. I leave the store and go back to the arena. As soon as I arrive, Blake comes back out again and he\\u2019s questioning me. I am trying to tell him that I know what I\\u2019m doing, but he\\u2019s agitated. He follows me into the change room. I want to lie down again and nurse my baby. He\\u2019s telling me I\\u2019m doing a whole bunch of things wrong. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s four pillows on the bed, it will be fine.\\u201d He leaves but he\\u2019s exasperated with me. I nurse my baby again and then she\\u2019s tired so I let her rest. I pile the pillows up around her. Because Blake has made me question myself, I stand there for a moment and think, \\u201cIs there any way that she would be ready to start crawling and get out of these pillows?\\u201d I\\u2019m positive that she\\u2019s not ready. I leave the change room and go out into the arena foyer. Now there\\u2019s a big lineup and it\\u2019s no longer an arena. At the end of the ramp where the door opens is a pier where a ferry backs in so people can drive onto it and go across the lake. While I\\u2019m standing there, I see one of my son\\u2019s friends and his mom and they\\u2019re waiting in the lineup. There are two different lineups about two feet apart. I\\u2019m standing between them. They both have a different agenda. The mom is going one place and her son is going another place. They\\u2019re arguing because the mom is saying one thing but her son is contradicting her saying, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what it says in the Bible.\\u201d I wonder when he started being interested in that because he certainly wasn\\u2019t all the years he was friends with my son. I think he deserves to be listened to. I ask him a couple questions about why he\\u2019s making that statement and why he has to go this way. He explains it to me. I think that makes sense and I guess really the only way to find out is if you actually get on the ferry and go to the destination and see if all those white rocks are actually there. I wish him good luck or the best or safe journey or something. I turn to the mom and say, \\u201cI think he\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t talk to me, she just keeps looking straight ahead and she had the whole time she was standing there. I turn around and walk back through the lineups and up the ramp, back to the arena and into the change room where my baby is still sleeping. I decide that I\\u2019m tired and I lay down beside her, put my head on the pillow and go to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cCourt Date\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house I used to live in and it was the top floor of a bungalow and in the basement was a doctor\\u2019s office. I\\u2019m in the back bedroom. I\\u2019m sitting on my bed and I have a laptop in front of me. I\\u2019m also curling my hair, which is extremely strange because I have naturally curly hair and I\\u2019ve never used a curling iron in my life. I take a piece of my hair and I put it between the mouth of the curling iron and I pull the curling iron all the way to the end the way I\\u2019ve seen other people do, which actually straightens my hair, then I wrap the curling iron around my hair and I hold it and then I unwrap it. Instead of my hair being curly, it\\u2019s straight. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m doing this and don\\u2019t understand why I would do this. I have this dream consciousness that is confused and then there\\u2019s another consciousness that is also saying, \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t even work! It doesn\\u2019t even curl my hair the way it\\u2019s supposed to!\\u201d My son is only about eight years old in the dream and he\\u2019s occupying the other back bedroom. I know he\\u2019s there because I can hear him moving around. Since I hear him moving around, I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts on the two documents I\\u2019m writing on my laptop so I don\\u2019t lose my train of thought because I\\u2019m going to do a board game with him or something. I want to see what he wants to do now that he\\u2019s awake. It\\u2019s morning. I have been up for quite a while. He has just woken up and I can hear this because there\\u2019s movement. I look on the laptop and I\\u2019ve got one document open where I\\u2019m trying to collect my thoughts and focus for an upcoming court case with my son\\u2019s father. The other one is something that I\\u2019m writing as a creative project that I\\u2019m not sure is for school or just enjoyment. I click into the court case one because that one\\u2019s more important and has a date coming up soon. I\\u2019m trying to sort out the threads in my head of how the court date arose, what the reason is for it. It\\u2019s really hard to sort out because I don\\u2019t want to make it into an attack on my son\\u2019s dad\\u2019s character, yet every reason I would put in there that I would say anything about is also going to be something to do with his character. I think this is why it\\u2019s so hard to write. If it wasn\\u2019t for his character, there wouldn\\u2019t be a court case. But he continues to lie and doesn\\u2019t follow through on any of the custody conditions. He just doesn\\u2019t do them then lies and says he was. So I typed five words out then keep deleting them. I close the laptop and get up to leave the room, but the door opens and my son is standing there. I ask him what he would like to do today. He says that he wants to go out to someplace. I get up and we go out into the kitchen to have breakfast first, but his dad is standing there. I\\u2019m confused as to how he got in the house. He\\u2019s in the kitchen and he\\u2019s making a piece of toast or sandwich or something and is carrying it out into the living room. He lies down on the couch and puts the sandwich on his chest and turns the tv on. I feel that this is somehow a violation of not only the custody arrangement but of my own personal space. Then my son goes into the living room and is watching the television, only it\\u2019s guys out on the town and it's really inappropriate for an eight year old boy to be watching. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat kind of arrangement is this?\\u201d I could have sworn he had his own place. I\\u2019m standing there in the kitchen trying to sort that out in my head. I\\u2019m wondering why I don\\u2019t remember this. Then I think of twelve other times recently where he\\u2019s been in the house and I start to doubt myself and think maybe I don\\u2019t have my own space and maybe he does live here and maybe this is what the court case is about because we still have to have personal time with our son. But since he\\u2019s making the sandwich and turning the tv on, it\\u2019s eroding my son\\u2019s attention and he\\u2019s just going over to the tv and now I\\u2019m not getting my own time with my son because of what his dad is doing. I walk back down the hall to the bedroom. I go back to the laptop because I think maybe there\\u2019s a document to help me remember whose day this is supposed to be and what the arrangements are because I didn\\u2019t think he was living with us. As I\\u2019m looking for that, my son comes into the bedroom. I say, \\u201cOh good, you\\u2019re back.\\u201d I close the laptop and think maybe I don\\u2019t have to sort this out. I say, \\u201cWould you like to play a boardgame?\\u201d He says yes. I say, \\u201cGood.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ve got this pinball machine in the closet that would be really interesting to play plus it would be good for his hand eye coordination and I like that it\\u2019s not television, it\\u2019s the opposite, it\\u2019s something you kind of do with your body. I say to him, \\u201cLet\\u2019s just play this for a few minutes. Then we can go out for a walk because it\\u2019s snowing out and it\\u2019s really pretty.\\u201d He says that he would like to do that. I show him how to pull the big plunger back, then watch it hit the ball, then the ball goes up and hits the other lights. I say, \\u201cThen you have to move this way, then you have to move that way because you want the ball to hit the paddle, then you use the flippers to hit it. We\\u2019re trying to get it to go into this part of the tube.\\u201d He does and he tries but he doesn\\u2019t pull the plunger back far enough and he gets discouraged. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay, here try it again, it\\u2019s alright.\\u201d But he only pulls it three times and gets discouraged again and wants to go out and lie on the couch with his dad and watch tv. I feel really defeated by this because that\\u2019s all his dad does. I tell him, \\u201cWell, your dad\\u2019s not supposed to pick you up at four, so let\\u2019s go for a walk, let\\u2019s go outside and walk through the snowflakes.\\u201d But then his dad comes down to the room and opens the bedroom door and bends down and picks him up and takes him back into the living room. Now I feel really resigned. I sit back on the bed, open up the laptop, and from my own memory, I\\u2019m typing out what I remember the custody arrangement to be. Every time I type a sentence, the computer erases it. There\\u2019s something wrong with the computer. Then I think that maybe if I record my voice and do text to talk, that will work, then I\\u2019ll just fix the typos that those things always make after. I'm trying to do that. Then I hear my ex going out the door. I hear the front door shut. I look out and he\\u2019s taken my son and gone. So I go out the front door and think that at least I can go for a walk now. I go out onto the back porch. It\\u2019s a beautiful sunny day. My phone rings. It\\u2019s my friend who lives in Holland now and I haven\\u2019t talked to in years. I tell her, \\u201cOh, hi!\\u201d I\\u2019m excited to hear from her. I notice she has a Dutch accent now and she didn\\u2019t when she lived in Canada and I think that\\u2019s from being in Holland for so long. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m just about to go for a walk, but I\\u2019d really love to talk to you. Can I call you back later?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell I only have time to talk right now.\\u201d I notice as I\\u2019m talking to her that my son is on the stairs at the bottom of the deck. I\\u2019m wondering what he\\u2019s doing there because he was supposed to be with his dad. I tell my friend, \\u201cI actually can\\u2019t talk to you right now because my son is here.\\u201d She sounds really disappointed, but I promise to call her back. I hang the phone up then these two men come walking up the back porch and I realize that they\\u2019re for the doctor who lives in the basement because this happens all the time between the hours of 8-4. It\\u2019s a man and his twelve to fourteen year old son. They\\u2019re walking together and the dad\\u2019s taking him to the doctor\\u2019s office. They\\u2019re about to go in when the man looks at me and says, \\u201cBathe me.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019m not going to do that!\\u201d He pulls up a chair and another for his son. His son sits in one of the chairs. He sits in the chair and crosses his ankle over his thigh and sits back a little bit, then he crosses his hands over his chest. Then he looks at me and says, \\u201cIf you come here I\\u2019ll tell you why that\\u2019s funny.\\u201d His son has a smirk on his face and so does the dad. I think he\\u2019s genuinely trying to tell me a joke. He looks completely harmless and his body movements are such that he\\u2019s still trying to keep the time for his appointment. I think, \\u201cShould I let him just tell his joke?\\u201d I start to walk over in front of him so he can give me the punch line, then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Domo\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to teach my class and there\\u2019s so much noise that I can\\u2019t even hear the sound of my own voice. I\\u2019m not sure what building I\\u2019m in, it\\u2019s got a sloped ceiling but the ceiling is also really high and there\\u2019s a little bit of slope to the floor. It\\u2019s almost like a lecture theatre, except there are no chairs. It\\u2019s supposed to have really good acoustics but it doesn\\u2019t because there\\u2019s so much background noise, but it\\u2019s not the students in the class that are talking, it\\u2019s students in the hallway and crowds of people outside. I can hear construction, jack hammers and buzz saws. It\\u2019s a cacophony of sound and so loud that I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m speaking or not. I can\\u2019t start my class. I go to the hallway, open the doorway and ask the people out there waiting to go into another class if they could please be quiet because they\\u2019re so loud. As I\\u2019m saying this, I realize there\\u2019s not supposed to be any talking in the building. So they say they will be quiet. I go back into my class. As soon as I start teaching, I can hear them again. They\\u2019re playing sports in the hallway, yelling and cheering. I can\\u2019t start. Then I\\u2019m sitting off to the side, I still have to sit there for the full hour, but I\\u2019m not teaching because I can\\u2019t. I see my brother. He\\u2019s not in the class, but he\\u2019s wandered up from the construction sight where people are building something. He\\u2019s taking a break. We talk for a few minutes. I feel really good to see him in my heart, I feel comforted by his presence. Then, it\\u2019s quieter. It stays quiet. I say I\\u2019m going to start trying to teach my class again. I ask him: \\u201cWill you stay?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t practice yoga, but he says, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll try it this time.\\u201d There he is. I move my mat from the middle of the class up to the front as though I\\u2019m a participant. This way I can be beside my brother. My voice, because of the design of the acoustics, it doesn\\u2019t matter that I\\u2019m not facing my class because the voice is supposed to carry anyways. So I start teaching and it\\u2019s so nice and quiet. I get through the sun salutations and a few other postures, then all the horrible noises start again. I try to teach a little bit more but I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I do a few more things just continuing on, hoping the class can see me and just follow along. This works for about five minutes, then the whole cohesiveness disintegrates so I stop. By this time the hour I was supposed to be in there was over and I\\u2019m free to go. I ask my brother, \\u201cEven though it was only a part class, what do you think? You looked like you were doing everything just fine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, you know it is a good class. But I\\u2019m not going to start doing it every day.\\u201d I laugh because I know he wouldn\\u2019t do that anyway. He goes back to the construction area and I go out the opposite door of where the students are going into the noisy hallway. I exit out of the building but it\\u2019s not really a hallway, everything turns into glass. There\\u2019s a glass vestibule and a door to the outside which is a docked area with a walkway and piers but I don\\u2019t see any ships. It\\u2019s good to be out in the sunlight and air. I see the husband and two kids of the two studio owners I work for. I walk towards them. I\\u2019m supposed to meet them because we\\u2019re all waiting for her. While we\\u2019re waiting, one of her kids is squatting down on the dock and looking into a hole in it. I\\u2019m curious at what they\\u2019re doing, they\\u2019re trying to pull out a bug. I walk over closer and actually see that he\\u2019s pulled out one already and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I wonder what kind of bug it is. I squat down closer to see and I\\u2019m just watching, I haven\\u2019t said anything to him. He has some kind of tweezers and is trying to pull out another bug and he\\u2019s working away at it for a few minutes. Then he says to me, \\u201cCan you see it down there?\\u201d I get a flashlight out from the back of my cell phone and am shining it around in the hole. I can see something but I don\\u2019t know what it is. Then he says to me, \\u201cHere,\\u201d and he hands me the tweezers. \\u201cCan you try?\\u201d So I get down a little closer on my belly. I can see something down there now. I want to be careful I don\\u2019t injure it. I put the tweezers around it gently and start to pull a little bit. Then I take it out. I have it just behind it\\u2019s skull, around its neck. I set it on the dock. It\\u2019s just sitting there, kind of like it\\u2019s stunned, probably because of the light. It was quite dark down in the hole. It\\u2019s got a very very very dark green body and a gold head. It has a band of gold at the top of its tail and the rest of its tail is green, a greenish black. I say, \\u201cOh what is this?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t have scales, it has the body of a beetle, but without the hard shell on the top so it\\u2019s soft. It\\u2019s tail is reptilian. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a domo.\\u201d I say, \\u201dHmm, I\\u2019ve never heard of that.\\u201d We look at it a little bit more. It has really beautiful black eyes and it looks like there\\u2019s a soul in them. Probably it\\u2019s three inches long. I say, \\u201cOkay?\\u201d He says yes. Then I put it back in the hole. The other things that he\\u2019s pulled out look like dead bugs, probably that the domo has fed from. I just use the side of my hand to brush them back into the hole. I give the son back his tweezers. We stand up. The daughter says something to me but I can\\u2019t recall now what it was. We move off to the side away from the dock. We\\u2019re still waiting for their mom to come. We sit. I don\\u2019t know how we got inside the building but we are. We\\u2019re in a different part of the building. The kids are playing together and I\\u2019m sitting down. The husband comes over and starts talking to me about something. Then he says, \\u201cJust a sec, close your eyes.\\u201d As soon as I close my eyes, I feel this big particle start to fall on my eye and face. He blows on my face. I feel it move along my eyelashes. Then he says, \\u201cOh are you upset that I did that?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking it was a little bit weird having his breath so close to my face. I don't think he meant anything intimate by it. I think he was just having a dad reflex, like when you say hold still and blow to interrupt a thing that was going to fall in your kid\\u2019s eyes. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But then I look at the thing and it\\u2019s like a big giant salt crystal, probably a quarter inch by quarter inch like a triangle cube. Now they\\u2019re falling all over the place. There\\u2019s a bed that\\u2019s not mine and somebody is supposed to be lying in it. These salt crystals are all over it. I look and there is a handheld vacuum off to the side. I say, \\u201cHey I\\u2019m going to use this and see if I can get these things off the bed before they fall all the way down to the bottom.\\u201d I turn the vacuum on and suck up these things. But there are so many of them that they are spilling out of the vacuum as quickly as they\\u2019re coming in. I dump these things out of the vacuum. I open the vacuum up, clean it all out, put the vacuum together and turn it on. I put my hand over the nozzle and feel that it has good suction. I go back to the bed and try to suck these into the vacuum. I pull the mattress away from the side of the bed so I can get in there. I do this a few times. Now I realize that I do need to sleep here. I don\\u2019t want to lie on these hard crystalline things. I\\u2019m trying to get them off the bed. I\\u2019m fiddling with this and trying to clean it. Then I see that the studio owner, the kids\\u2019 mom, is back. Something completes. I don\\u2019t have to wait anymore. I\\u2019ve done what I\\u2019m supposed to do and can check out now.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Songwriter\\u201d I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It\\u2019s like a small theatre, so it\\u2019s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they\\u2019re hosting a band. I don\\u2019t sit at one of the seats though, I\\u2019m standing at the back. I\\u2019m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I\\u2019m listening to the lyrics because I\\u2019m familiar with them. I\\u2019m really just wanting to enjoy how they\\u2019re paired with the melody. We\\u2019re about four songs in. He sings this one and it\\u2019s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I\\u2019m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn\\u2019t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight\\u2019s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I\\u2019m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he\\u2019s finished and, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to tell you about that song.\\u201d I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It\\u2019s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It\\u2019s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, \\u201cOh, where did this come from?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI found it in your friend\\u2019s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he\\u2019s dead.\\u201d It\\u2019s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn\\u2019t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn\\u2019t really grieved his friend\\u2019s death. That\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It\\u2019s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, \\u201cNo way, he wouldn\\u2019t have written this for me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.\\u201d I can see it\\u2019s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I\\u2019m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It\\u2019s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d How could there be any other result here other than he\\u2019s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?\\u201d He\\u2019s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he\\u2019s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, \\u201cThank you for showing me this.\\u201d We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Protective Glasses\\u201d I go back to the same theatre. This time I\\u2019m with my daughter. We\\u2019re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I\\u2019m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There\\u2019s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There\\u2019s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they\\u2019re closing them and stuff, but we\\u2019re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we\\u2019re standing there and we\\u2019re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don\\u2019t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: \\u201cWhat are those glasses you\\u2019re wearing? Are they protective somehow?\\u201d She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHmm, wow, maybe they do work,\\u201d kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there\\u2019s an indoor pool. It\\u2019s the same thing where we\\u2019re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you\\u2019re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it\\u2019s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they\\u2019re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don\\u2019t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can\\u2019t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher\\u2019s attention and say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s in there, she\\u2019s in the pool.\\u201d I go back outside so I\\u2019m behind the glass and I\\u2019m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I\\u2019m scanning the water, there\\u2019s no daughter. I\\u2019m starting to get scared and thinking, \\u201cAre they so busy testing everyone that they\\u2019re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?\\u201d I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to be in here! You can\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for my daughter! She\\u2019s underneath the water. She\\u2019s not surfacing.\\u201d They look and she\\u2019s not in there. Now I\\u2019m really scared, like, \\u201cWhat the heck? Where is she?\\u201d The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She\\u2019s definitely not in the pool. We\\u2019re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I\\u2019m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She\\u2019s coming from the back of the pool. They\\u2019re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?\\u201d She says, \\u201c Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.\\u201d I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I\\u2019m upset with her.\"],[\"\\u201cChalk Paint\\u201d I\\u2019m in a car and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are really slushy. You can feel it underneath the wheels of the car when the slush is so thick and heavy that it kind of pulls the car in the direction you\\u2019re not steering, so it\\u2019s a real struggle to let it go straight. I pull into a parallel parking space at the side of the street that looks very much like a street I recognize, which is supposedly the widest main street in Canada. I get out of the car and I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk looking up. It\\u2019s an old railway town. The stores are made of the red clay brick and they go straight up because they\\u2019re tall and skinny and probably have three levels to the stores because they have to plus an attic full of old junk. I\\u2019m reading the names of the stores because I need some chalk paint. None look like they\\u2019re likely to have chalk paint, although one looks like a little bit of a possibility. I\\u2019m just about to walk over to it when I see someone I know from the old yoga studio I used to work at. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing standing there. I tell her I\\u2019m looking for chalk paint. I realize as I\\u2019m saying that she actually lives here. I add, \\u201cDo you know any place that would have some?\\u201d I briefly describe the project I\\u2019m doing and I tell her the look I want it to have because I don\\u2019t want just plain white chalk paint or anything like that. I want seafoam green and a chalky turquoise. She says, \\u201cYes, I know the perfect place. It\\u2019s one block down that way and it\\u2019s called Moody\\u2019s.\\u201d I thank her and walk towards the direction she indicated. I\\u2019m standing in front of the store now and I have my son with me. He\\u2019s about ten in this dream. It doesn\\u2019t look like a place that would have chalk paint, although she said that it does and she goes there all the time and their selection is fantastic and she spent a few sentences endorsing it. So undaunted, I go in anyway. There are kids all in the front of the store and they\\u2019re unsupervised kids probably between the ages of six and eight, maybe nine. They\\u2019re throwing toys up in the air and boys are engaged in a cooperative game of something they just invented. There are a few younger kids just staying back out of the danger zone. I think this can\\u2019t be the right place so I go out of the store, read the sign and see that it\\u2019s spelled the same way, and so I re-enter. Now I\\u2019m looking for someone who is running the store. I see an elderly man and it kind of looks like he\\u2019s wearing a paint smock, so I make a bee-line for him. I ask him if he has chalk paint. He says, \\u201cYes, I do. There\\u2019s a selection right over there,\\u201d and he points. I think, \\u201cHow could I have missed this?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking and there\\u2019s a little shelf, probably about five feet tall by about two feet wide by about ten inches deep. It has three boxes in it that look like there might have been a small canister of paint in them at one point, but they\\u2019re all opened. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s why I missed it because it also has a ramshackle assortment of kids toys on it. However, I walk the way he indicated thinking that maybe there\\u2019s something more here than what I\\u2019m seeing. But no. There\\u2019s one small pint of paint in one of the boxes and the other boxes, you can tell there used to be paint in them but they only have the accessories that would have come with the paint. Miraculously, the one little pint of paint is an antique white. I think, \\u201cWell this might work.\\u201d But I still need the other colors. I\\u2019m not really finished. I walk over to the counter with the paint and there\\u2019s a lineup of parents in front of me all asking him questions about their kids. My son is not in the room anymore, but he\\u2019s ten and I\\u2019m not worried. I think he must have found something to do while I\\u2019m doing this. I wander into the back room and there are more kids playing cooperative games. There\\u2019s a shelf full of kids blocks and he\\u2019s over there and helping some younger kids build something big out of blocks. We make eye contact and I shake my head like, \\u201cNo we\\u2019re not ready to go yet.\\u201d But now I know where he is so I walk back out of that room and stand in the lineup of parents at the counter. When it\\u2019s my turn, I say, \\u201cIs this all the apint you have?\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering why would my friend tell me that this guy has a fantastic selection and it\\u2019s excellent. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019ve got a few more boxes behind the counter.\\u201d I look and they\\u2019re identical to the open ones that had been on the shelf and they\\u2019re also open. As he pulls one out I notice that the paint is not the color that it said on the box. I feel an internal eye roll happening in my own body. I think this is going to take forever. Instead I describe the two colors that I want: \\u201cI want a chalky turquoise and a chalky seafoam green.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell I have this one called mint green.\\u201d I look at it and it\\u2019s far too candy-like. It looks like a wedding reception mint. I say, \\u201cNo. That's got too much blue in it.\\u201d Then he pulls out another one and says, \\u201cHow about this?\\u201d It\\u2019s an obvious blue. I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, that\\u2019s too dark.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cHere, well I have these samples.\\u201d It\\u2019s a board that has a fingerprint of paint colors on it with the paint colors underneath. I think we\\u2019re making progress. I actually find the two colors I want and say, \\u201cYes! It\\u2019s these two. Do you have these?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust a minute.\\u201d He rummages underneath the counter. He\\u2019s gone and it\\u2019s like there are stairs leading down to the basement. He\\u2019s gone for about half an hour. I leave the room I\\u2019m standing in because I\\u2019m in danger of being pinged on the head by some flying toy. I go into the other room where my son is and I just sit there and watch the kids playing. About half an hour rolls by and then the man waves at me from the doorway and gives me the thumbs up. I tell my son it\\u2019s time to go. I go back to the counter and sure enough he has the two colors of paint. I pay him and we leave.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Warpath\\u201d I\\u2019m living with a group of people outside on the plains, like a meadow but the earth is soft. We live and sleep outside. We\\u2019re on the way somewhere, we\\u2019re traveling. We\\u2019re tired and we need to stop and rest. We have adults as well as elderly people and some young kids in our group as well. I\\u2019d say when the dream starts there are probably about one hundred of us. We gather flower tops and berries and roots as well as small animals and that\\u2019s our food. I don\\u2019t get the small animals, but somebody does. We sleep on the grass, too. We\\u2019ve got wool blankets that we wrap ourselves in. There\\u2019s a group of indigenous people and the first time we come into contact with them, they have deep reddish brown horses that they\\u2019re riding. They just come in and they sweep through and it\\u2019s so quick and so violent that we\\u2019re in shock, we\\u2019re stunned, we don\\u2019t even react. Some of us just run and others are caught up by them or killed instantly. A couple of the women are carried off. We don\\u2019t know where to go to hide from them because there\\u2019s just more of this wide open plains area. So what we do instead is we\\u2019ve got these iron spikes, they\\u2019re like pegs that are about nine inches long. The next day we drive them into the ground around the outskirts of where we are so that the next time they come, they ones on foot will step on these and so will their horses and hopefully that will deter them from the mad sweep that they do really fast - they won\\u2019t be able to do that and that will give us a little bit more time to get away. All day long we spend driving these stakes into the ground so they stick up about six inches from the ground and about six feet apart, but they won\\u2019t be able to see them because they came at dusk last time and we know they\\u2019re going to do that again, probably at dusk. That night when we sit down to eat they don\\u2019t come, nothing happens. We eat, we sleep, we wake up again. A few nights pass like this. We\\u2019re pretty sure they\\u2019re going to come back. But during that period of time while we\\u2019re waiting, I have a few conversations with some of the kids, like the almost pubescent boys. There\\u2019s a group of three or four of them that sit there sullenly the way teenagers can be though they\\u2019re not yet teeangers. One of them in particular doesn\\u2019t like how the adults in the group are handling this at all. He\\u2019s becoming bitter and angry. I\\u2019m asking him how he thinks things should be done differently. He says that we should just get out of there. I say, \\u201cOkay, where would you have us go?\\u201d Then he doesn\\u2019t answer. There\\u2019s another one who is upset by his attitude and when I leave the conversation they get into a fist fight. Me and a few of the others go in and break it up. We know we need to do something differently and there\\u2019s that generally consensus starting to thread its way through our group. Now there\\u2019s not a hundred of us anymore, there\\u2019s about seventy because thirty were killed or taken the last time there was a raid. It\\u2019s that night that as soon as we finish eating, it\\u2019s just dusk when things are grey, when the natives come through again. They\\u2019re slowed down a little bit by the spikes but they quickly figure out they can go around them. More people do manage to get away and they only pick off about twenty this time. But this reduces us to fifty. The next day some of the men say they\\u2019re going to scout to see if there\\u2019s any other place we can go. They go into the forest. The forest is really thick and this is the issue. Do we keep moving forward on the plains or do we risk what\\u2019s in the forest? So that\\u2019s where a couple of men go to see if we can shelter there. But we also want to keep moving and we don\\u2019t want to just sit there hiding in fear which is where we might get stuck if we go into the forest. We\\u2019re thinking about what else we can do to defend ourselves from these raids. There\\u2019s also the elderly people who really aren\\u2019t capable of moving much farther at this point. We continue spending our days driving these iron spikes into the earth, trying to spread them around so we have a complete circle around us. That night when the men come back they say they\\u2019ve got good news and bad news. They tell us that they think there\\u2019s a different way of life moving forward from here, but we\\u2019ll have to change how we relate to each other as a group. One of them says, \\u201cEach woman has to pair up with a man and stay with him forever. The one man will be responsible for the survival of the one woman.\\u201d I think this is ridiculous. What\\u2019s going to happen to all these elderly people? There are no men for the elderly women, so who\\u2019s going to speak for them? I\\u2019m also disgusted and thinking, \\u201cEw there\\u2019s not one of you in this group that I want to stay with forever.\\u201d I\\u2019m suspicious about where this idea came from. The two of them maybe cooked this up together when they went into the forest and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a solution and won\\u2019t help the group survive as a group, it will just pick certain people out of it and leave the other ones to die. It really upsets me. That night the natives come through one more time. Only this time they only carry off one of the women. We\\u2019re sitting at a group of about forty-five people left. I\\u2019m avoiding picking any one of the men tonight. In fact, I\\u2019ve decided to stand up for the elderly and I will feed them at my table and give them seats there. The teeangers, the younger boys that I talked to the other night, also seem to agree with me and they moved their sleeping mats to where I\\u2019m sleeping with these eldelry people.\"],[\"\\u201cWheat\\u201d I\\u2019m eating supper with my friend who is a dietician and her family. She has four kids and her husband is there, too. She\\u2019s describing to me the benefits of a plant based diet and invites me to stay for supper. I agree because I think it\\u2019s going to be all plant based food, but instead, she dishes out pasta like spaghetti that already has tomato sauce mixed in with it, and starts putting it on everybody\\u2019s plates. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you, I can\\u2019t eat wheat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, hmm, that\\u2019s all we have.\\u201d I say,\\u201dThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m used to not eating anything as opposed to eating wheat and suffering through the effects of it for weeks to come.\\u201d When her family is finished eating I notice that hardly any of her kids ate all the pasta. She just scrapes it all into the garbage. I wonder why she\\u2019s feeding her family stuff like this when she\\u2019s been advocating this plant based diet and also creating such waste. I find this puzzling.\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on a path outside. It feels like I\\u2019m in Canada with meadows and a coniferous forest. I see a snake. It\\u2019s sunning itself and they\\u2019re usually a bit preoccupied when they\\u2019re doing that so I\\u2019m not alarmed and I\\u2019m just watching it. It\\u2019s a big snake, it looks like a boa but it\\u2019s not six feet long, it\\u2019s [probably about four feet long. Maybe it\\u2019s a baby boa. It\\u2019s about three inches thick through the middle. It has a really attractive assortment of markings, pretty intricate with a lot of colors. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m just standing there looking at it, I\\u2019m admiring it. All of a sudden it springs, it recoils, and it shoots itself maybe three or two feet away from me. It does this so quickly that I scream. As I\\u2019m screaming I see that it saw a rat and it just shot itself over to the rat. But I screamed so loud that I actually woke myself up. My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to go back to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m now in a place outside with snakes. Now I\\u2019m a little bit nervous in my dream. There are different colors and sizes of them and they\\u2019re all on the ground where I am. I\\u2019m trying to tippy toe around them. I\\u2019m not in the same place I was in the first dream. This place has a tropical lush feel. I\\u2019m trying to pick my way through the snakes. I\\u2019m scared and really want to run but I\\u2019m afraid quick movements will disturb the snakes. So I\\u2019m walking very slowly and carefully, tip-toeing. I make it through the forest without being attacked by snakes. I come out in someone\\u2019s backyard or a recreational area with an in-ground pool. I see some people I know - the Jones family. I know the mom and one of her sons. The mom sees me and waves me over. I go and sit with her as she indicates - in front of her. We\\u2019re sitting in outdoor lawn furniture and there\\u2019s an umbrella over our heads. She\\u2019s talking because this is her family reunion. She\\u2019s describing the relationships she has with everyone. She\\u2019s animated and enjoying this conversation. I certainly don\\u2019t mind listening to her describe her connections and her joy with her family. Then she asks me if I want to swim. I happen to be wearing a bathing suit underneath my dress and tell her, \\u201cYeah, that would be great.\\u201d I get in the pool. I\\u2019m swimming around, just enjoying the water. There are a lot of other people in the pool. At one point I lean back against the edge of the pool and put my elbows on it and lean my head back a little, letting the rest of my body float up near the surface. I\\u2019m just lightly moving my feet to keep my lower body afloat. My mind kind of drifts away. I\\u2019m aware of other people there but I\\u2019m just enjoying the sun. There\\u2019s an intense blue sky above me. I\\u2019m in the water and it\\u2019s just nice. But then the laughing gets closer and becomes more sporadic so it disturbs my reverie. I open my eyes and let my feet float down towards the bottom of the pool. I notice that one guy is standing at the edge of the pool and he\\u2019s doubled over and holding his stomach because he\\u2019s laughing so hard. He\\u2019s barely wearing any bathing suit. It\\u2019s like the guys are wearing thongs. I realize from listening to the conversation that they\\u2019ve had a competition, I guess it\\u2019s an annual thing at the family reunion of who has the skimpiest bathing suit. It\\u2019s just the men doing this. I notice that I\\u2019m surrounded by the generation of men who are having this competition. I wish that I\\u2019d known that before I got in the pool and was lying there. I would have stayed out of it because I feel out of place here. The reason they are laughing so hard is because the guy standing beside me only has a small amount of bathing suit and it\\u2019s just over his dick, like a half applied condom. They\\u2019re laughing because he wins this year and no one thought of doing that. It\\u2019s a bathing suit because it\\u2019s technically made of bathing suit material. I can\\u2019t remember how I get out of the pool, but suddenly I am. I wrap my towel around my body and make my way back over to where the mom is sitting. Then, I turn around in my chair and see some of these snakes around the edge of the pool. When I look at the snakes and then back at the scene in front of me it\\u2019s not the Jones family reunion, it\\u2019s the Weber family reunion. The two matriarchs do not get along, but I think they did at one point. Now I\\u2019m talking to Mrs. Weber and I see the oldest Jones son standing there in her reunion. He doesn\\u2019t see me. I saw his face for a moment and then he turns around and walks towards the pool where the men are gathered. I think this isn\\u2019t good because that Jones son used to be married to the Weber daughter and Mrs. Jones is not going to be happy to discover that the son is actually a member of the other family as well. Then the dream shifts again. I\\u2019m sitting in front of the Jones matriarch talking to her. I ask her if she was aware that the Jones son is also a member of the other family, the one she doesn\\u2019t want him to associate with. She questions me and says, \\u201cHow do you know that?\\u201d I tell her. Then I say, \\u201cAnd I think it\\u2019s true because if you stop for a moment and trace the lineage, you can see where the two families were once one family.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh no, you\\u2019re right. They are.\\u201d She gets really thoughtful and stops talking.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Colourful Night\\u201d I\\u2019m with my first boyfriend. It feels like we\\u2019re in Mexico. There\\u2019s a beach and an ocean. It\\u2019s nighttime but there are so many colors of lights and festivities of people gathered together. The sounds of music and lights are all off in the distance. I\\u2019ve been to Mexico and it feels like that colorful joyous culture. We\\u2019re walking along the beach at night. He\\u2019s telling me that he\\u2019s only here for a little while. I feel a bit sad about that. I want him to stay longer. As we walk a little farther on, it\\u2019s really pretty. It\\u2019s a white sand beach and there\\u2019s a moon. You can tell the color of the sand because the moonlight is bright. We approach a path leading down to the beach from somewhere else, and I can see it in the darkness. We turn up it and start to move away from the beach. There\\u2019s a night market with crafts and people who have made crafts and set up a makeshift vendor tent out of a few simple poles and some canvas or fabric. There are a lot of these makeshift tables. There\\u2019s a camaraderie kind of atmosphere as we walk through. They\\u2019re background noise though because we\\u2019re in conversation with each other and we\\u2019re walking through the market, we\\u2019re not stopping at the vendors or looking at their crafts or what they have to offer. We come to another path. We turn up it, away from the vendor market. It\\u2019s like beach apartments, flat, one level and very simple, obviously places where people sleep because the sound from the market and ocean is reduced here. I suddenly realize that I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re sleeping - I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s sleeping or where I\\u2019m sleeping. I\\u2019m getting tired and want to lie down and rest. He says we can sleep here for the night and indicates a door on his right. He says it belongs to his brother. So we open the door and right inside the door is a bed. We lie down on the bed and I close my eyes for a few minutes. I wake up and feel like it\\u2019s not that much longer but he\\u2019s behind me and his arm is around me. It feels soothing even though I\\u2019m awake and listening to the sounds around me. In a little while, he wakes up. We both sit on the bed and have a conversation where I tell him that I want him to stay longer. He says he can but there are a few conditions. He wants to be able to work on his art and he wants his own space. There was something else he wanted, but I can't remember. I think, \\u201cOkay, these are easy to fulfill and he already does that anyway.\\u201d Without any second guessing or additional contemplation, I agree. He seems really happy about this and so am I. We leave the apartment and walk back through the marketplace. We go a little farther and there are some raw materials like clay and wood. He\\u2019s poking through those looking for something he can use. I\\u2019m doing the same thing but not with the same materials. Some other people start to infiltrate the environment where we\\u2019re doing this right now. They\\u2019re talking to me and asking me what I want to use these materials for. They\\u2019re asking what he wants to use these for, too. There\\u2019s the feeling that they are causing a disconnect between us. I don\\u2019t want to answer all these questions. It doesn't matter to me what they think. I just want to collect my materials and see if he\\u2019s ready to go. That\\u2019s how the dream ends with this constant onslaught of interruptions that are obstacles to what I\\u2019m really trying to do.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Grandmother\\u2019s Shoes\\u201d I\\u2019m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I\\u2019m at the dining room table. There\\u2019s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It\\u2019s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I\\u2019m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s her or someone else. Maybe it\\u2019s her with someone else\\u2019s face but she\\u2019s not alive anymore. Here she is and she\\u2019s acting like Nancy but she doesn\\u2019t look like her. We\\u2019re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they\\u2019ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad\\u2019s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, \\u201cNo, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.\\u201d I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she\\u2019s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they\\u2019re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, \\u201cThese don\\u2019t look very comfortable!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYou might be surprised. Try them on anyway.\\u201d So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It\\u2019s too small and it\\u2019s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d I put it back in the crate. She says, \\u201cTry another pair.\\u201d I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they\\u2019re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they\\u2019re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there\\u2019s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren\\u2019t completely flat, they\\u2019re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it\\u2019s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, \\u201cGrandma, I\\u2019m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.\\u201d They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re a seven anymore. I believe I\\u2019m now an eight. But isn\\u2019t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say anything, but she says, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can\\u2019t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, \\u201cWait here one moment.\\u201d She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, \\u201cTry these ones on.\\u201d She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they\\u2019re flat and they don\\u2019t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they\\u2019re comfortable. She says, \\u201cYou can have them.\\u201d She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, \\u201cAre you guys ready to go yet?\\u201d They\\u2019re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re wearing Grandma\\u2019s shoes.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cYes, she gave them to me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.\"],[\"\\u201cDinosaurs\\u201d I\\u2019m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We\\u2019re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she\\u2019s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she\\u2019s telling me these things, she\\u2019s asking me what I think. I\\u2019m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I\\u2019m doing is I\\u2019m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we\\u2019ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, \\u201cMy coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.\\u201d She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I\\u2019ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it\\u2019s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it\\u2019s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it\\u2019s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They\\u2019re wrestling with each other but they\\u2019ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They\\u2019re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I\\u2019m stunned. I\\u2019m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it\\u2019s winter and it\\u2019s freezing. Now I don\\u2019t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they\\u2019re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don\\u2019t seem to see where I\\u2019ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I\\u2019ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they\\u2019re looking around but their bodies aren\\u2019t moving, They haven\\u2019t located where I am yet. They\\u2019ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I\\u2019m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can\\u2019t leave them in there! There\\u2019s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they\\u2019ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they\\u2019re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can\\u2019t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn\\u2019t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he\\u2019ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I\\u2019m up to now and they\\u2019re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to shred the door. I don\\u2019t have any boots and it\\u2019s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don\\u2019t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I\\u2019m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I tell her what happened. She\\u2019s strangely puzzled and doesn\\u2019t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Coffee Pot\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It\\u2019s snowing out. There\\u2019s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it\\u2019s still snowing. There\\u2019s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there\\u2019s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don\\u2019t. The house is brick. It\\u2019s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it\\u2019s taller than it is wide. It\\u2019s old. I can tell it\\u2019s old because the glass isn\\u2019t flattened by a machine, it\\u2019s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I\\u2019m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It\\u2019s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say \\u2018it likes\\u201d because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It\\u2019s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it\\u2019s mostly black. It looks like it\\u2019s made of cast iron but it\\u2019s not because it\\u2019s light when you pick it up. I think it\\u2019s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It\\u2019s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There\\u2019s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It\\u2019s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I\\u2019ll sometimes look for it. I\\u2019ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it\\u2019s going to disappear and come back again. This day it\\u2019s missing. I have a roommate. She\\u2019s more like a neighbor but she\\u2019s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I\\u2019m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I\\u2019ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I\\u2019m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, \\u201cHave you seen the coffee pot?\\u201d She continues to look at me but doesn\\u2019t nod her head yes or no. I say, \\u201cJust in case you\\u2019re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you\\u2019re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?\\u201d She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I\\u2019m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It\\u2019s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it\\u2019s happy. When it\\u2019s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it\\u2019s been. It\\u2019s like every time it comes back it\\u2019s a little bit different. Sometimes it\\u2019s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It\\u2019s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it\\u2019s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Passageway\\u201d The property we have is like a winery in the sense that there are wild grape leaves growing everywhere. It\\u2019s old. The house is made of stone. There\\u2019s a lot of land. We don\\u2019t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it\\u2019s sustenance farming. We don\\u2019t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren\\u2019t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I\\u2019m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it\\u2019s not one big cohesive unit, it\\u2019s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn\\u2019t know were there. I\\u2019m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it\\u2019s not heated. My dad tells me that we have to go and take stock of what\\u2019s in the basement because he has to list the house for sale. My brother and I go down there. The basement is super creepy. There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There\\u2019s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I\\u2019m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there\\u2019s a passageway that leads off. It\\u2019s like a crawlspace and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going in there. I turn around and my brother is gone. I can see his torch light and he\\u2019s in there looking around. How can he do that?! He\\u2019s in it for about ten minutes. I\\u2019m not freaking out, I know he\\u2019s okay. Nothing bad has ever happened to us in this place. I trust it, it\\u2019s just creepy. I don\\u2019t like all the slimy scuttling things and I don\\u2019t want them in my hair. I\\u2019m on edge. He pops out and I say, \\u201cWhat did you find?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what he says. This isn\\u2019t the first time he\\u2019s been in there and he was checking on what he had in there. He says it\\u2019s good. Then we go back up the stairs which are really rickety, and up into the kitchen. There\\u2019s a dug out place beside the kitchen; it\\u2019s just dirt with big stones. My dad is standing there and he says, \\u201cAlright, let\\u2019s go take stock of what\\u2019s in the barn.\\u201d My brother and I still have our torches in our hands but we put them out when we came up the stairs. The torches are all made of wax and now they\\u2019re shorter with more wax drippings on the outside because of the time we spent in the basement. We go out the side opening. There aren\\u2019t any doors, just openings. The kitchen does have glass on the windows. We go over a meadow into this other place. The stones are piled up. They\\u2019ve been chipped away into roughly big square shapes and stacked on top of each other, sawed and stuffed into the cracks to keep the weather out. Grass and bits of organic matter and seeds have grown in the sod. This is what the whole thing is made of, every structure. Now we go into the structure my dad calls the barn. It has a side entrance made of this sod packed stone. We go in there. The whole thing is one big open space which is why my dad called it the barn, except we never had any animals. There had been animals at some other point. We look around. Again, we take our torches. But the torch in this structure has never been lit. My dad has the lit torch. When we get in there, my brother and I put ours on his. Mine won\\u2019t light. My brother\\u2019s did. I\\u2019m calling to them, \\u201cWait, wait, my torch isn't lit!\\u201d He comes back. Mine is being really stubborn and takes a little while to light. It does but it's very dim, it\\u2019s like it\\u2019s wet and it won\\u2019t stay going very well. I\\u2019m not doing anything except trying to keep up with them. There\\u2019s nothing in there. There\\u2019s a place we didn\\u2019t explore, it\\u2019s another passageway off the barn. My dad turns around and says, \\u201cOkay that\\u2019s good.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you sure? Because there\\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. We need to organize this so that when the real estate agent comes, we have all the categories of all the places on this property written down and they\\u2019re evaluated separately or we won\\u2019t get the value we deserve.\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care. I just want to sell it.\\u201d I think he makes some comment about his age and says it doesn\\u2019t matter due to his age. I\\u2019m arguing with him and say, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s precisely why you should get out of this property what you deserve. You\\u2019re not working anymore. This is what you have to support you through your age.\\u201d Now he\\u2019s thoughtful. He just doesn\\u2019t feel like doing it. My brother and I decide to finish it on our own. We leave the barn with my dad and walk around the outside. I see that there are so many different kinds of fruit growing around - wild cherries, peaches, quinces, pears and apples. I wish I had time to gather these and preserve them. Now we\\u2019re back in the kitchen and have a little bit to eat, just some bread and a wheel of cheese. I don\\u2019t eat any of it though, I just give it to my dad and brother. Some others who are part of our extended family come to the table that is handmade out of wood. There standing there. Some of them have fruit in their hands and are eating as they gather around. This is where I identify my daughter and her ex-boyfriend. I say, \\u201cWe need to go back down into the basement and take more stock of what\\u2019s there.\\u201d We do this. My brother spends a lot more time in that one passageway. He\\u2019s growing something in it. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to move that though. Whatever it is, you need to move it before the real estate agent comes.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, I know.\\u201d Then he gets thoughtful and I can tell he\\u2019s thinking where he\\u2019s going to move it. He says, \\u201cMaybe I\\u2019ll just move it further back because no one is going to go in there.\\u201d I think he\\u2019s right. I worry about him because no one knows how far it goes. No one has gone far back including him. This makes me feel on edge again. Now we exit the side building. The real estate agent and lawyers will be here shortly. No one has gone through the barn yet. My brother, daughter, her ex-boyfriend and I light our torches and go into the barn. Mine is doing the same thing where it won\\u2019t stay lit but the barn is brighter because there are now four torches. I see the passage at one end actually connects to the house, but instead of going underground, it goes above ground and I find it odd that we haven\\u2019t noticed this before. The odd thing is that even though there\\u2019s nothing there and the barn is a lot dryer and there are no creepy crawlies and webs and spiders and night living things the way the basement had, I always feel a presence at my back like beings you can\\u2019t see that are in there. It\\u2019s thick with them and I can feel it. We go through the bends of the passage and we end up behind the house. I say, \\u201cInstead of entering the house through the side, my dad\\u2019s probably in there with legal people, we should go underneath so we\\u2019re quiet and don\\u2019t interrupt them.\\u201d We agree to do this, but the passage takes us into where they are. We\\u2019re sneaking around trying to be really quiet and all of a sudden my dad and the lawyers see us and we all start laughing. I say, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t think you would be here. We were deliberately trying to be quiet so we wouldn't interrupt you.\\u201d My dad remarks, \\u201cWell you never know where the passages in this house are going to lead.\\u201d Everybody thinks this is funny so it takes some of the tension off. However, I can\\u2019t shake the feeling that there are other people living in this house who we haven\\u2019t found. As I\\u2019m saying this, I look up and see the glow of a torch from inside the wall and it\\u2019s way up high in the place between the room off the kitchen and the kitchen, it\\u2019s in that wall. The wild cherry vines had covered it up but the cherries have gotten really ripe and they\\u2019re falling off because they\\u2019re so heavy and ripe, so I can see this crack in the stone. I get my dad to lift me up. I\\u2019m heavy, an adult size, so I can feel his arms shaking. He can\\u2019t hold me up for very long. I got a glimpse of people in there! There\\u2019s a dad and a mom. He puts me down. I say, \\u201cYou need to lift me up again. I saw a man with a hat on.\\u201d Someone else lifts me up and this time the arms are steadier. I see a baby strapped onto the mom\\u2019s chest and a young boy the age of nine who has covered his face with the same kind of pointy hat his dad has. I notice the mom has one of those hats, too, but the point of hers is tipped over to the side. There\\u2019s a whole room we didn\\u2019t know about and they live in this room. He puts me down and I say, \\u201cWe need to find the passageway that leads there to tell them the house is being sold.\\u201d I think the buyer is going to tear it all down and I\\u2019m worried about this family. We go through the passage again only this time we\\u2019re looking at the walls trying to find cracks. I know where this should be directionally. But once we\\u2019re in the passageway, it\\u2019s hard to keep your sense of direction. We\\u2019re in the barn again and I feel the presence. I turn around and this time it startles me and there\\u2019s the man with the hat and veil over his face. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the man from the room in the wall.\\u201d He says yes and I share with him that it\\u2019s going to be sold and I think it\\u2019s going to be torn down. He says he has nowhere else to go with his family. My brother says, \\u201cWell there is somewhere else.\\u201d He indicates the passageway where he has been growing things. The man says, \\u201cOh we\\u2019ve come from there and I don\\u2019t know if I want to go back there with my wife and kids. I\\u2019ve considered it but my wife wants to stay where we are and take our chances.\\u201d The dream ends with us having this conversation of where there is to go after there and the sadness that someone would even think about tearing down this magical place that holds so much history. We\\u2019ve lived there and survived. The water is pumped from the ground with the handle. We have torches. We don\\u2019t need the electricity. We\\u2019ve been able to survive on the fruit around the house. I don\\u2019t want to leave and neither does the man with his family.\"],[\"\\u201cOld Wrongs\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of strange building. I don\\u2019t know what it is, it\\u2019s the upper floor of something. There\\u2019s a hallway with a niche off to one side with two couches facing each other. There\\u2019s a long room that\\u2019s empty. I\\u2019ve been teaching in the long room - meditation, it\\u2019s a yoga teacher training. It goes really well. I\\u2019m happy with the session. The studio owner I used to work for is sitting on the couch when I come out after the session and she says to me: \\u201cI have no further need of your services. How much do I owe you?\\u201d She gets out a checkbook. I tell her that she owes me for all the sessions she booked me for, not just the one I finished today. She says, \\u201cOh I don\\u2019t have to pay you that.\\u201d I explain that she does because I turned down other work in order to hold those days open for her. Then she kind of freezes, the way they do in plays where one person freezes then the spotlight turns to something else. I see sitting on the couch across from us, a student of mine. He tells me that she has hired him to work for her. I say, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I\\u2019m debating whether or not to share with him how she treats people, just to warn him. Before I can say anything, he says to me, \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s asked me to come in for the next couple of Sundays just to see how I do.\\u201d I say, \\u201cIt sounds like you\\u2019re volunteering.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, she said that if I do a good job, she\\u2019ll pay me at some point.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you okay with this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cEh well, I was going to be around anyways, so I don\\u2019t mind doing it.\\u201d He tells me the times and dates that she asked him to come by and teach her group. It\\u2019s the other two dates that she booked me for. I\\u2019m thinking that just figures, she\\u2019s found a way to get someone to teach for free. He seems really uplifted or excited by the idea that he\\u2019s just a new fresh grad and already teaching a teacher training. He\\u2019s confident and stuff and I don\\u2019t really want to take that away from him, but I\\u2019m also really disgusted by this kind of treatment of the sacred teachings of yoga. There\\u2019s no way anyone fresh out of a 200-hour teacher training is experienced enough to pass on any kind of wisdom. She\\u2019s just using it as a money maker. I feel this frustration combined with disgust welling up inside me.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Talent Show\\u201d I\\u2019m at a Yoga Studio where I used to teach but stopped because they basically tricked me into working for them by promising me a certain rate but refused to sign a contract I asked them to sign. I worked for them for a whole month without knowing what I would be paid. They figured I would just keep doing it because I had formed an attachment to the people in the class. I\\u2019m just standing inside the front door of the studio. My son is with me. I see the owner\\u2019s daughter but I don\\u2019t recognize her at first because she\\u2019s lost so much weight, she\\u2019s even about six inches shorter, and she\\u2019s wearing a lot of eye makeup. I deduce who she is because she\\u2019s behind the desk, not because I recognize her. There are a lot of people and families in there and in fact it\\u2019s packed, which surprises me. The owner walks in and he gives me a cold glance and keeps walking. My son has mingled with the people, although I didn\\u2019t intend to stay, I need to get him to go home. The only reason I\\u2019m there is to pick something up from the desk. The owner\\u2019s daughter is looking for it for me. The director is the main person that wouldn\\u2019t sign the contract and kept telling me she was going to the next day and the day and the next day until I started teaching. She delayed until they thought it was too difficult for me to back out. She\\u2019s behind me and gushing about being so happy to see me. I feel like it\\u2019s a performance for the people standing around. She\\u2019s got one of her hands on each of my shoulders and she\\u2019s standing behind me but to the side. I feel repulsed by the fact that she\\u2019s touching me and pretending to be this beaming friendly person when she\\u2019s a viper on the inside. Then, it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being moved forward by the crowd. I move with the flow because I\\u2019m scanning for my son and I need him because I\\u2019m ready to go. The owner\\u2019s daughter is standing beside me and talking to me. We get into the actual practice room and there\\u2019s a stage at the front. There must be two-hundred people in there, families, sitting on blankets and towels. She asks me if I want to sit down beside her. I agree. Then I gradually take in what\\u2019s going on here. It\\u2019s set up for kids. All the kids are wearing costumes and there are three boys on the stage. They\\u2019re setting up for some kind of act. I finally catch up with my son and he says, \\u201cMom, can we please stay? I want to sing two songs.\\u201d The owner\\u2019s daughter indicates that it would be okay if we stayed. I tell him, \\u201cAlright.\\u201d We sit down. For the first act, you can\\u2019t even figure out what the boys are doing. They\\u2019re on for about ten minutes. Nobody is stage directing. It\\u2019s just really laissez-faire. Other kids are running across the stage as these three are acting out something, but it\\u2019s not cohesive, it has no direction. At one point, one jumps down from the stage really slowly and pretends to fall. The other takes a run from the side and slides across the stage. It just goes on and on. I think, \\u201cOh my god, we\\u2019re going to be here for hours and hours.\\u201d That\\u2019s how the dream ends, just sitting and waiting.\"],[\"\\u201cMain Duck\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It\\u2019s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There\\u2019s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There\\u2019s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there\\u2019s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That\\u2019s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend\\u2019s son who I\\u2019ve sailed with before. We\\u2019re having something to eat. I\\u2019m not very hungry. I\\u2019ve brought a few things to eat that I just don\\u2019t feel like eating right now, so I\\u2019m just waiting. People are deciding what we\\u2019re going to do for the day. We\\u2019ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It\\u2019s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There\\u2019s a town and we\\u2019ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I\\u2019ll just eat there when I\\u2019m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They\\u2019ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can\\u2019t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I\\u2019m hoping there\\u2019s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There\\u2019s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it\\u2019s really messy. I\\u2019m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There\\u2019s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, \\u201cWow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she\\u2019s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we\\u2019re just staying for three days. That\\u2019s okay because there\\u2019s not a lot to do here and I\\u2019d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don\\u2019t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We\\u2019re back in the reception room. The owner\\u2019s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he\\u2019s going to leave right now because it\\u2019s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he\\u2019s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend\\u2019s boyfriend tells me that we\\u2019re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that the opposite direction?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the direction we\\u2019ve been going.\\u201d I say, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I indicate where we\\u2019ve left from and where we\\u2019ve tied up and I say, \\u201cThis is south.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo here, I\\u2019ll show you on a map.\\u201d He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship\\u2019s made and we\\u2019ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We\\u2019ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn\\u2019t make any sense to me.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Gas Station\\u201d I\\u2019m in a university and I\\u2019m working there. I really like how it supports its employees. There are all kinds of extracurricular activities and they aren\\u2019t restricted to the employees, you're allowed to bring your families. I have both my kids in the swimming lessons. I\\u2019ve also found someone who\\u2019s quite adept in music and in fact he\\u2019s a professor in the music department, and he will teach my kids music lessons, as well. He can play multiple instruments. This is great and I\\u2019m happy about this. My kids can choose an instrument that they want to explore and they can use the same time slot for music lessons. They can change their instrument if they like, but keep the same time slot and teacher. The other thing that makes me happy is I\\u2019ve got it set up so they have swimming first then music lessons with a half hour to change in between. It means that one night is dedicated to this instead of having to be out every night. I actually did this in real life when they were little as it frees up more time in the week. My daughter, though, has been taking music lessons somewhere else. I\\u2019ve needed to communicate with her that she\\u2019s to come to the university now. I do this then lie down for a nap in my house. When I get up, she\\u2019s confused about where she\\u2019s supposed to be for music. She\\u2019s come into my room to ask me without realizing I was taking a nap. The action of coming in and leaving has woken me up. I get up and go out of my room. I see that my son has dumped out his legos and it\\u2019s all over the floor and I\\u2019m asking to pick it up because it\\u2019s time to go. Now I\\u2019m looking for my daughter to tell her she\\u2019s to be at university at 6 o\\u2019clock unless he wants to get ready and come with me now. She says she wants to come with me now. When I go back into my room to get dressed, there\\u2019s a woman in there. She\\u2019s painting the walls in my bedroom with a roller. I\\u2019m trying to collect my clothes and get dressed but I feel like there\\u2019s nowhere to change because there are legos where I normally would change and a woman painting my room. I feel rushed and unprepared as I\\u2019m trying to get my own self ready. I open my door so the door is like a shield between the woman painting and me. I just get dressed in front of my own open door, but I know she can\\u2019t see me so it\\u2019s okay. My son is ready. We go downstairs. It kind of morphs into my dad and stepmom\\u2019s house. They\\u2019re just finishing up dinner. I tell them I\\u2019m on my way to the university for swimming lessons. My stepmom says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve got a half hour to kill. Why don\\u2019t I go to the university?\\u201d She wants to have a talk with my daughter and is interested in having some time with her. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine, I\\u2019ll meet you guys there.\\u201d My daughter says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just go with Nanna, then.\\u201d Whatever it is I have to do with my son first, my daughter would rather be occupied then sitting there waiting. I agree to meeting there. The dream kind of skips. I get in the car with my son. I\\u2019m supposed to pick up my daughter at the cottage. The music lessons are over. We\\u2019ve gone to the university and both kids have had the swimming and music lessons. My daughter is still going with my stepmom and my son is riding with me. Now we\\u2019re going to meet at my dad and stepmom\\u2019s cottage. I need to get gas first. We\\u2019re on the highway and I go past the turnoff to the cottage. I see a sign for the turnoff. I go to where there is a sign at an intersection, but no gas station. I turn right, go up one intersection, but now we\\u2019re in the country - there\\u2019s no town, no landmark, no anything. I turn right again and see a gas station. I think, \\u201cGreat, all I have to do is turn right one more time and I\\u2019ll be back on the same highway as the cottage turnout. I\\u2019m stopping to get gas. The gas is on my bicycle, so I have to park the car and get the bicycle out of the trunk. The whole gas station area is graveled and it makes it hard to turn the vehicle in such tight quarters, as well as my bicycle. The pump is really close to the entrance of the house. The gas station is not very busy because there\\u2019s not very much traffic and it\\u2019s just in front of someone\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s a square\\u2019ish rectangular building and the drapes are drawn. I am figuring that someone must be watching from the house and will come out when they see someone at the pump. It\\u2019s hard for me to get my bicycle between the pump and the front of the house because it\\u2019s such a tight turn. It\\u2019s hard to do this. I have to turn the handlebars to turn the front wheel, then pick up the back wheel to do this. While I\\u2019m doing this, I see the curtain move and figure someone has seen me and will come out. This is the case. As my bicycle is in place, a woman comes out. I ask her if I can have some gas. She pumps a little bit into the tank on the bicycle then puts the rest in a mayonnaise jar and says, \\u201cThere, you should not run out of gas for a little while.\\u201d I notice now that my son has gotten out of the car and is playing with a bunch of kids, a couple years younger and older than him, near the front of the pump where the driveway is - it\\u2019s the entrance from the highway. I\\u2019m putting the bicycle back in the trunk of the car and calling him over. He\\u2019s not listening, he\\u2019s involved in a game where they\\u2019re kicking and throwing a tiny ball. I get in the car and start slowly driving it towards the entrance. The kids are moving a little bit but not very much. It\\u2019s making it difficult to maneuver the car because I can get speed up to get through the gravel and I\\u2019m not getting the hood of my car lined up with the driveway very well. I\\u2019ve also got the window rolled down and am calling him to get in the car. He finally responds. Now I\\u2019m telling the other kids: \\u201cCan you please get out of the way? Move towards the house. Move please.\\u201d They\\u2019re not moving. I\\u2019m just driving really slowly. It feels really heavy and onerous in my dreaming body. I finally get the hood of the car lined up with the exit and I leave. Now I\\u2019m at the intersection that was clearly labeled with the sign for the highway, and the sign is gone. I drive up the road looking for it and am thinking that there\\u2019s no way it could be this far up to the left. I turn around hoping it will reappear and I just missed it somehow. I never see the sign but I know it\\u2019s down to the right and my sense of direction tells me where I\\u2019ve come from. I just drive down to the right. My car disappears. My body slides down this passageway between innocuous looking grey buildings. As I\\u2019m descending, I start to see colors: green and red and a sunset orange. It spits me out. I\\u2019m in this interesting little town that looks like \\u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang,\\u201d an ancient Walt Disney Movie where the town is made to look old fashioned and magical. I\\u2019m fascinated by these buildings. I walk around a little bit in the painted area. I can see that the color stops when I look up to my left. I want to look around more first. There are some people there and I ask them what they\\u2019re holding. They look like shop vendors and the colored buildings are stores. This one lady has a farmhouse style platter for serving turkey and it\\u2019s meat but encased in a light flaky dough. She\\u2019s really proud of it and is offering me some. There are people crowded around trying to taste it, but I say no thank you and smile as though what she\\u2019s offering is appealing, even though I think it\\u2019s disgusting. I keep walking down the alleyway of that row of buildings and come out to another one. There\\u2019s more activity here. The things that make it move are made of wood, like the mechanics of this town are handmade, hand-chiseled and hand-hammered. So realize that I still need to be looking for the highway. I walk around a bit because it\\u2019s beautiful and I\\u2019m fascinated. Then I walk up and now I feel like I\\u2019m going through layers of time and hoping they won\\u2019t shift before I get back to my car. I go from the deep wood mechanical layer of downtown and back up the alleyway with the painted area of town. Sure enough, the painted brick buildings are still there and so is the lady with the flaky roast beef. I walk back up, but not up the slide I came down on because it\\u2019s like a brick chute. I\\u2019m walking, not sliding. I find the adjacent path up and can see the one I slid down, so am like, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019m still going the right way. Everything is still in place.\\u201d Then I see someone else to ask just before I go back to the gray area. I tell her I\\u2019m looking for the highway and she says, \\u201cWhich one?\\u201d Now I realize I don\\u2019t know the name of it even though I\\u2019ve driven it so many times. She says, \\u201cThe only one I know is over there to the right. It\\u2019s Highway 86.\\u201d Now that she\\u2019s pointing, I can see the actual highway and a big green government sign that says, \\u201cHighway 86.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s the right one because it has a map on the sign. I say, \\u201cWhich road leads to that? None of them are marked anymore.\\u201d She indicates the one that I started going down even though there was no sign. I\\u2019m relieved to hear this. I get back in my car and start driving down that road. It does spit me back out onto the main highway. Now I have to retrace my steps because the little sign to the highway is still gone. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Race\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house with a couple of rooms. The rooms are spacious. There\\u2019s a dining room with some kind of chandelier in the middle of it. There\\u2019s a foyer between the dining room and living room. The foyer has a door that goes to the outside. The living room is also spacious with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The foyer that joins these two rooms is quite large with some furniture in it as well. I\\u2019m with another woman and two men. The other woman and the man have a relationship together. At the beginning of the dream I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re off in the shadows. I have a new relationship with the man that I can see. He\\u2019s white and has dark brown hair. I can see his features, they\\u2019re a little angular and pointy. He\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am and slim. We\\u2019re just getting to know each other. We talk somewhat. I have a feeling I\\u2019ve been set up with him but I don\\u2019t feel any energy with him and he\\u2019s a stranger. We do start talking. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing together really, but we move around the rooms and talk in different areas. I can feel myself starting to warm toward him. He can be interesting. I am starting to like him. The woman and the other man come out of the shadowy part of the dream. The man starts to talk to the man I was with. The woman approaches me and asks if we want to leave to go out for the day. We\\u2019ve both separately agreed that we do. The vehicles are motorcycles. The man I\\u2019m supposed to ride with seems to be recovering from some kind of injury and his buddy is asking him about the injury. He tells him that he thinks it\\u2019s going to be okay. Now I look and see him flexing and extending his leg at the knee. He says, \\u201cSee look, everything seems to be fine.\\u201d So, we put chaps over our legs and put on heavier coats. We go outside, get on the motorcycles and tour around for a little bit, then come back. We come back in. I'm involved in some meal preparation, as is the other woman. The two men are also doing things to help prepare. Then we have a meal on the table. We share the meal, all four of us. The other two recede into the shadowy part of the dream and leave me with the man I was speaking with and riding with all day. Now I can feel the pulse of a growing sexual energy between us. We explore this for a bit. We\\u2019re in the foyer when we\\u2019re doing this. The other man interrupts us and tells my partner that he needs to come out and look out the living room window and see what\\u2019s going on. My partner and I separate. The two men go into the living room. I\\u2019m tidying up and getting dressed. I see that there are a number of vehicles on the other side of the street, different models of Jeep from the more rugged safari type to the SUV type. Each one has a driver that has gotten out and they\\u2019re kind of congregating on the shoulder of the road. I can see also that some of them have been injured. The men are clapping each other on the back warmly like, \\u201cYou did it!\\u201d Others are rotating one shoulder up and back and bending elbows as though the shoulder and elbow have been injured but are now starting to heal. I notice that it\\u2019s a sunny day now whereas previously very little light was coming in the windows and it was semi-dark. This living room is very bright now. We\\u2019ve got a great big long console tv like the kind people would have in the 1960s that sits in a big wooden box. They\\u2019re starting to gather around to watch a big race. Some of the men that are coming in are quite elderly; whereas the man I was sharing energy with is in his forties. It\\u2019s a variety of males. They\\u2019re finding seats in this giant living room on the couches lining the walls. They\\u2019re setting up to watch this race together and it seems to be a really big event. I\\u2019m not interested in it, but I am interested in what\\u2019s going on in the backyard. I walk out. The living room exits into a greenhouse, like a sunroom, which then exits out into the backyard. I realize I\\u2019m in my grandparents\\u2019 house on the north shore and I have been all along. I\\u2019m looking for the rose bushes. All the gardens are only at the beginning with shoots, like the beginning of spring after a long winter. I\\u2019m just going from garden to garden to see what\\u2019s coming up. I go back into the house. I see the woman\\u2019s features now and it\\u2019s my stepmother. I tell her that there are some things coming up in the garden. She then just recedes into the kitchen. I check on the men in the living room and they\\u2019re still watching the NASCAR races. Then I notice that someone recently has cut roses and put them in vases in the sunroom. The roses are this deep pinkish red in the middle with light green petals around the outside. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat an unusual rose,\\u201d and I wonder who cut them and from which bush. I go back outside. Now it\\u2019s like the beginning of summer and everything has bloomed. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and I look down the length of the lawn. I can see the top of the boathouse and it has grass on it. I want to go lie there because I want to feel the waves and hear them under my body and soak up the sun. I go around to the side of the house first to see if the red and green roses came from there. No rose bushes there. There\\u2019s some kind of gardening shelf, just a little bench made of painted white wicker, with a small cupboard underneath. I open it up to see if I can find gardening tools. Somebody has already opened it and there\\u2019s a pair of gardening gloves and some shears and a couple containers sitting on the top of the bench. I wonder who has been wearing them and if it\\u2019s the person who has been cutting the roses and putting them around the house. I go a little farther and see that one of the plants is a Rose of Sharon but it\\u2019s not in bud yet. Then I decide to stop looking around the other side of the house and walk down the length of the lawn to lie in the sun for a little while. Then I can hear people talking, the doors opening, and people starting to leave. I know the race is over. I stand up and walk back towards the little bench to see if the gloves and shears are still there. I\\u2019m going to try and find some roses because I want to put some in my own room. My stepmother comes out and says, \\u201cYou really like it here, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s beautiful. Can we stay for a while?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think so.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good. There\\u2019s so much space. It\\u2019s nice not to have to squish myself into a room or turn my body sideways to get into a closet or out of a door.\\u201d She agrees. I say, \\u201cEven if I had a brand new house, they only make the bedrooms nine by nine now. I really like having a big bedroom.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, we can stay for a little while.\\u201d Then she recedes again. I go back into the living room. My friend and his friend are the only ones that remain. His friend asks him to come out for another motorcycle ride. My friend asks if I\\u2019d like to come and I say, \\u201cYeah, I would.\\u201d We get our motorcycle clothing back on and get on the bikes.\\u201d We\\u2019re driving down the highway. It goes around a bend and something I\\u2019m carrying, I think it\\u2019s a roll with a change of clothes in it, flies off the bike and I can see it beside the road. We don\\u2019t stop until we come to an outdoor cafe. I can feel that my right eye has tears in it that have been running down my face, but my left eye is dry. The friend of my friend says, \\u201cI wondered if you were ever going to express any of your grief. I can\\u2019t believe you haven\\u2019t done it until now.\\u201d I tell him that I was, he just couldn\\u2019t see it. He says, \\u201cHmm,\\u201d as though he doesn\\u2019t believe me, and then says, \\u201cWe should go back to the corner and get what you lost.\\u201d I agree and let them take me there.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Dream\\u201d I don\\u2019t understand the structure I\\u2019m in. There\\u2019s a room, but it's not really closed in. It has a ceiling but it\\u2019s almost like it doesn\\u2019t have any walls; it\\u2019s just a floor and a ceiling. It\\u2019s good wood floors. There are shelves but I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on them; they go in a vertical line, shelf after shelf, and there\\u2019s a walking space between them. At the far left corner of this room is a desk and a chair and a glass partition like the kind movie theatres have as a small ticket booth. There are no walls on this partition though - it just has the glass front where people would pass the money and tickets through. My daughter is sitting in there. She\\u2019s writing something or doing something on the desk with her hands. I can see a level below this floor. It starts around where the desk is and is about four feet lower. Again, it doesn\\u2019t have any walls and it extends back with a ceiling above it. I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s back there. There\\u2019s a guy sitting there and he\\u2019s also at a desk and he\\u2019s got a swivel chair. He\\u2019s swiveling around, getting something behind him, putting it back on the desk, maybe calculating something, typing it in, swiveling back and forth. This guy is somebody I just met. My daughter has passed something under the glass that I\\u2019m supposed to pick up. I\\u2019m on the same floor as she is. I need to get to the floor underneath and I don\\u2019t know how I get there, but I\\u2019m just suddenly there. As I go to pick it up, the guy sitting at the desk underneath the pickup window - kind of in the way- swivels his chair around and I have to lean over him to get it. I am trying to stretch my arm over him because I think I can reach it. I come within a couple inches of it but I can\\u2019t get it. Instead of swiveling back and forth in the same pattern and rhythm as he was, he deliberately stays there a little bit longer and makes body contact with me. I can feel a sexual energy between us. I\\u2019m intrigued by this but also feel that I need to finish whatever task my daughter passed onto me. I wait for him to swivel back the other way so I can grab whatever it is she passed me. It\\u2019s like a tube, it\\u2019s tiny and pen-shaped. I get it this time. It\\u2019s in my hand. I go back into the shadowy part of this lower level that\\u2019s on the same floor as he is. I\\u2019m doing something but I\\u2019m unaware of what it is. When I come back out, he\\u2019s standing up in his chair. My daughter has come out from behind her desk and they\\u2019re talking to each other. He kisses her on the mouth. She looks surprised and backs up a step. I wonder why he did that. I think they really do have a lot in common. Then the dream just ends. But there\\u2019s something else, when he kisses her on the mouth, it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a golden light all the way around them both. It illuminates her surprise and it\\u2019s quite a beautiful light. I can see how golden and young and beautiful her features are. It doesn\\u2019t change the fact that she\\u2019s surprised, but it\\u2019s that the kiss left that beautiful golden light around her face and head.\"],[\"\\u201cIn the Bathroom\\u201d This is a weird one. In my dream, I\\u2019m in a shower enclosure. It comes as one unit, so there\\u2019s a bathtub and it keeps going up into the shower and you just step into it. There are pegs sticking out of the wall. I\\u2019m trying to pull the middle one out of the wall; it\\u2019s stuck and I need it to come out of the wall. It won\\u2019t move. I put my right foot up against the wall and brace myself. Then I put my left foot up there, too. I\\u2019m not standing on the ground. I\\u2019m pulling as hard as I can. It\\u2019s not like it releases so I fall back, like when you\\u2019re pulling something and you build up force and once the thing you\\u2019re pulling on releases, the force releases and pushes you back. So that doesn\\u2019t happen. It releases and I feel it release in my hands. But then I\\u2019m in a different bathtub-shower thing. The next one I\\u2019m in is a ceramic green bathtub. It has tiles on the wall like subway tiles. I\\u2019m doing the same thing. I\\u2019ve still got the peg in my hand. I can see the other kind of plastic enclosure beside me. I\\u2019m wondering how I got to be in the bathroom inside the bathroom.\"],[\"My boyfriend and I were robbed by three of my classmates.\"],[\"dancing at a drag queens party and laughing out
