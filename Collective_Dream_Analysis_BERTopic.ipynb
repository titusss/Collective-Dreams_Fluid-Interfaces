There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there\\u2019s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It\\u2019s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I\\u2019m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I\\u2019m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don\\u2019t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They\\u2019re all great and I love them all. I\\u2019m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don\\u2019t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I\\u2019m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I\\u2019m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he\\u2019s pointing out. It\\u2019s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I\\u2019m in a shop. It is Jeremy\\u2019s shop. It\\u2019s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It\\u2019s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race. So we set a trajectory...\"],[\"\\u201cAdventures\\u201d I take a taxi to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I arrive and he\\u2019s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I\\u2019m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I\\u2019m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He\\u2019s also wearing something similar. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t really look like pajamas, so it\\u2019s okay to go out in them.\\u201d So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He\\u2019s in the front seat, passenger side. I\\u2019m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I\\u2019ve ever been to the town stadium. I\\u2019m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, \\u201cDo you mean the Place or the Colosseum?\\u201d At the same time as he\\u2019s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He\\u2019s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I\\u2019m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we\\u2019re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It\\u2019s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it\\u2019s glassed in and there\\u2019s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it\\u2019s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there\\u2019s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I\\u2019ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He\\u2019s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I\\u2019m trying to think where I\\u2019ve seen him. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He\\u2019s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they\\u2019re hundreds of years old. They look like they\\u2019re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it\\u2019s old because the lawns aren\\u2019t maincured, but set because they\\u2019ve been cared for so long they don\\u2019t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it\\u2019s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800\\u2019s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you\\u2019re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It\\u2019s just a screen door and is not latched. I can\\u2019t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman\\u2019s voice say, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I answer back, \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It\\u2019s a kitchen. It\\u2019s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it\\u2019s made just for cooking. There\\u2019s a doorway and we go into the next room. There\\u2019s a proper sized eating table in it. There\\u2019s another oven on the wall and I don\\u2019t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it\\u2019s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn\\u2019t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you\\u2019re on the waterfront. We\\u2019re about to go down the steps when I say, \\u201cJust a minute. Let\\u2019s walk back through here again. I noticed something.\\u201d So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, \\u201cLook, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There\\u2019s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn\\u2019t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.\\u201d Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We\\u2019re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I\\u2019m walking. He doesn\\u2019t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It\\u2019s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I\\u2019m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He\\u2019s a little more scared than I. I\\u2019m surprised that he\\u2019s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it\\u2019s like a pig fetus. It\\u2019s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He\\u2019s getting a little scared. It\\u2019s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I\\u2019m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can\\u2019t see it if you\\u2019re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There\\u2019s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there\\u2019s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They\\u2019re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there\\u2019s this other kind of thing that I see. It\\u2019s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to swim in that water.\\u201d Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She\\u2019s clothed and under the water. It looks like she\\u2019s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, \\u201cOh no! We have to save her!\\u201d So, I slip into the water and grab her. She\\u2019s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady\\u2019s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There\\u2019s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she\\u2019s only been hanging onto the pole and she\\u2019s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she\\u2019s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She\\u2019s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, \\u201cLook, she\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I\\u2019m giving her small sips and supporting her head.\"],[\"\\u201cAngry Mob\\u201d All I remember is standing by feeling helpless while watching an angry mob. They were weaponized with sticks, clubs, baseball bats, things you could pound on with. They were filing up the street angrily shouting and it was a street that looked like a suburban street. They were smashing the cars that were parallel parked, smashing the hoods of the cars, breaking all the glass in the windows, getting on top of the cars and smashing the roofs and just going up the street doing this. In the dream, I watch this, feeling helpless to stop. I can\\u2019t permeate the crowd. I have nothing to protect myself with. Then the crowd is gone - they continued up the street and are out of sight now. I\\u2019m standing while other people come out of hiding. They are commenting on the damage. Somebody says, \\u201cI know who the first two cars belong to. The first one belongs to the president of yoga and the second one belongs to the vice president.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cBraids\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large crowd of people. Somebody that I\\u2019m working for has instructed me to make sure that no one\\u2019s hair is in their eyes. I\\u2019ve got this kit that has different things that can be braided into people\\u2019s hair and fastened so the braids don\\u2019t come out. There are quite a few different pieces and lots of different colors, so that no matter what color anyone\\u2019s hair is or what color their skin is, the braids will look attractive and match their own personal style. When I first start doing this I\\u2019m using a chart because some people have been sick. I\\u2019m in a white sterile type of environment. I kind of move through there braiding the hair of those I kind. It\\u2019s one long white room packed with people shoulder to shoulder. It\\u2019s kind of hard to maneuver around and do what I\\u2019m supposed to do. As I complete this task, the room leads into another room that is dark with no lights on. So instead of being really bright and whiite, it\\u2019s dark but also more colorful. There\\u2019s a stage and people are performing some kind of music up on the stage. It\\u2019s an open mic night, so it could be anybody. There isn't a full band, just one person at a time performing. While this is going on, I\\u2019m on the lower level around whoever is watching and doing their hair. Then I complete the braids of the people I\\u2019m supposed to. The next person is a guy that\\u2019s just finishing performing. He\\u2019s sitting off to the side of the stage. More people are coming from the audience and sitting on the side so you can hardly see where the stage is. It\\u2019s also dark. I\\u2019m wondering what I\\u2019m going to do with his hair because he has a scarf around his head, his hair is inside of it and he\\u2019s wearing a hat on top of that. I tell him what I\\u2019m here to do and he says, \\u201cOkay. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to do with it though.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell what would you like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m pretty happy with it the way it is.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine. Do you want me to just put a couple of pieces around the temples?\\u201d He takes the hat off and removes the scarf. His hair is all in cornrows. One of them is binding all of them into one large ponytail. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019ve been instructed to do his hair, it\\u2019s perfectly fine the way it is. So I just try and wrap the scarf around his head the way it was and fasten it a little more sturdily. While I\\u2019m doing this, I see my ex-best friend. She\\u2019s taking the stage and jumping up and down and waving her arms around, but that\\u2019s all she\\u2019s doing. She\\u2019s not singing anything, she doesn\\u2019t have any talent, she\\u2019s just jumping up and down trying to get people to look at her. Then I see her family coming up to watch her, but the parents have had two more children. I think, \\u201cWow, the mom is over fifty. The youngest is probably going to be orphaned soon. I wonder how fair that is to have kids at that age?\\u201d When her family arrives, she stops jumping up and down and pretends to be limping as though she\\u2019s sick. Everyone is rushing over to her and saying, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\\u201d I feel like oh there she goes again doing her antics. I don\\u2019t go over and speak to them. I pick up the things I was using for the hair. I say goodbye and thank you to the guy who had basically undid his perfectly good hair and let me touch it and do something with it that wasn\\u2019t even useful and then he put it back together himself. I walk back through the crowd. Now I look down. I\\u2019m sure I was completely dressed when I started this, but now I\\u2019m wearing a tanktop that\\u2019s one of those old man\\u2019s undershirts. My own underwear is white and baggy like an old man\\u2019s. I feel exposed and naked. I\\u2019m not comfortable with this. I don\\u2019t even want anyone to see me. I\\u2019m trying to shoulder my way back through the crowd and stay in the dark. I go into the washroom which is part of another big room - it\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s bedroom. It\\u2019s a really messy bedroom with clothes all over the place. I\\u2019m hoping I can find something to put on.\"],[\"\\u201cCar Pooling\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town that looks like modern suburbia. I\\u2019m driving a car. I come down a street and it\\u2019s like a keyhole where you have to turn around eventually. There\\u2019s some parallel parking up by the curb. I go around the keyhole and pull up so I\\u2019m facing the same way that I came in. I get out of the car. I walk down a little walkway that goes in between two houses. I walk past the houses and to another row of houses behind that have no street access. I go into the front door. It belongs to one of my yoga teacher training students. There are a couple of kids in there and other students from my teacher training. She gets her things together. We both walk out of her house to my car. We drive the car around to a different street that looks very much like the street we were just on. We drive to the end of the keyhole and get out. We go into a building that feels like a university. I don\\u2019t remember what we do. We come back out and get into the car and drive back to her house. I park in the same space that I did before. This time when we go into her house, there are a lot more people in it. There\\u2019s a tall man wearing glasses. I can\\u2019t see the color of his eyes. He has strawberry blond hair brushed straight back from his face, it\\u2019s shoulder length. He\\u2019s talking to me about something but I don\\u2019t remember what it was. There are a couple of students from my yoga teacher training who are still there and some small kids under the age of five. One of the kids is a one year old with a very bright alert face. He\\u2019s crawling then grabbing a piece of furniture to pull himself up to standing, taking a couple of steps, then plunking down and crawling again. He\\u2019s circulating around to all the people, using their knees to pull himself up. He\\u2019s making non-verbal but very animated sounds. He looks at me with this very piercing eyes that look like a much older adult. As he\\u2019s making these rounds, he gets to me. He has this charisma. I\\u2019m quite fascinated with his charisma. You know how kids when they want to be picked up but don\\u2019t have any speech, they just reach with their arms? He does this. I pick him up. He uses one arm to point. I know he\\u2019s using me as legs so he can\\u2019t get to the other side of the room. He has some kind of agenda. So I stand up and take him over. He\\u2019s pointing at the sink and wants the sink. I shift him down a bit so I\\u2019m hoisting him up with my hips. He\\u2019s leaning over the sink and his feet aren\\u2019t touching the ground. He wants to play with the water. I\\u2019m looking around and don\\u2019t know which of the people are his parents. Nobody looks like they own him. Nobody is alarmed that he\\u2019s at the sink. Nobody is making any kind of awareness at all, so I guess it\\u2019s fine. I turn the tap on and he\\u2019s playing with the water with his hands. It\\u2019s one of those great big farmhouse style sinks so it\\u2019s pretty deep. There\\u2019s a plastic container beside the sink. For some reason, the floor is under his feet and he\\u2019s really stable so quite safe to stay there. I leave him there for a second to get a towel. I turn around for about three seconds. In those three seconds, he gets the plastic container and it has oil or something in it. I look at it and think there was Vitamin D in it. He\\u2019s found an eyedropper and he\\u2019s made a pattern with the Vitamin D all over the sink and on the tap and stuff. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYup, leave it to a baby to create a giant mess in one second.\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering if I should wipe this up or maybe it\\u2019s good that it\\u2019s there because it\\u2019s Vitamin D. I take my own hand and am doing the same thing he\\u2019s doing - massaging the Vitamin D onto the sides of the sink, coating it. I know that it\\u2019s getting into us through our skin. Then I realize that the students that are talking are sharing dreams. I wonder how I missed that and I don\\u2019t want to miss it. I think I pick the baby up and put him on my lap, but then he disappears into the dream and I\\u2019m sitting where I was when I picked him up originally. I hear Cora talking about something in her dream. Her hair is short. I\\u2019m listening to Meg talking about her dream. She\\u2019s talking about a dream where Cora cuts her hair off. I feel like I want to interrupt because it\\u2019s the exact same dream I had last night where Cora cuts her hair. She had really, really long brown hair. Then of course we're both sitting looking at Cora with short hair. The whole group realizes that Meg and I had the same dream in advance of Cora cutting her hair. Then I\\u2019m not sure that Cora cut her hair because we had the dream. So I\\u2019m thinking about this and not saying anything, just mulling it over in my mind. Then Meg\\u2019s boyfriend starts talking about a dream he had. Meg is saying that they\\u2019re not co-sleeping well together because he makes so much noise. I say to her: \\u201cWhat about if you bring an iPod to bed and play ambient music through the earbuds?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI tried that but he doesn\\u2019t like it when I do that.\\u201d So I\\u2019m thinking this is a little bit of a stonewall; he snores so loudly that she can\\u2019t sleep but won\\u2019t let her do any of the things that prevent her from hearing. So they\\u2019re both telling me these things and I\\u2019m thinking that maybe I should tell them the story of how the double bed came into being. I say, \\u201cDo you know that the double bed actually isn\\u2019t very old? It only came into being for economic reasons a short while ago. People slept in separate beds and couples would have a courtship dance of inviting each other into their rooms. They would either send a runner with an invitation or they would leave hints, dropped like flower petals. It made your sex life so much more exciting to have this dance aheadof time.\\u201d Meg looks really excited about it. The boyfriend looks a bit skeptical but I can tell that he\\u2019s interested. I think I\\u2019ll just leave the rest to them and I get up and walk away. I\\u2019m trying to figure out whose house I\\u2019m in and who all these people are. As I rejoin the other conversation, Cora is saying that they grew up in the house in the front where I parked my car. Her brother, the guy with the strawberry blond hair whose eyes I can\\u2019t see, bought the house beside this one first. When she was old enough to move out, she bought this one. I think this is why there\\u2019s no access road, the family has just divided their property. I think it is so nice to be this close and spend time in each other\\u2019s houses but walk in and out. I think this is similar to the sleeping arrangement where you have your own space but are surrounded by family. I feel really glad to be part of this grouping if even for a moment. It feels really, really good.\"],[\"\\u201cChalk Paint\\u201d I\\u2019m in a car and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are really slushy. You can feel it underneath the wheels of the car when the slush is so thick and heavy that it kind of pulls the car in the direction you\\u2019re not steering, so it\\u2019s a real struggle to let it go straight. I pull into a parallel parking space at the side of the street that looks very much like a street I recognize, which is supposedly the widest main street in Canada. I get out of the car and I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk looking up. It\\u2019s an old railway town. The stores are made of the red clay brick and they go straight up because they\\u2019re tall and skinny and probably have three levels to the stores because they have to plus an attic full of old junk. I\\u2019m reading the names of the stores because I need some chalk paint. None look like they\\u2019re likely to have chalk paint, although one looks like a little bit of a possibility. I\\u2019m just about to walk over to it when I see someone I know from the old yoga studio I used to work at. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing standing there. I tell her I\\u2019m looking for chalk paint. I realize as I\\u2019m saying that she actually lives here. I add, \\u201cDo you know any place that would have some?\\u201d I briefly describe the project I\\u2019m doing and I tell her the look I want it to have because I don\\u2019t want just plain white chalk paint or anything like that. I want seafoam green and a chalky turquoise. She says, \\u201cYes, I know the perfect place. It\\u2019s one block down that way and it\\u2019s called Moody\\u2019s.\\u201d I thank her and walk towards the direction she indicated. I\\u2019m standing in front of the store now and I have my son with me. He\\u2019s about ten in this dream. It doesn\\u2019t look like a place that would have chalk paint, although she said that it does and she goes there all the time and their selection is fantastic and she spent a few sentences endorsing it. So undaunted, I go in anyway. There are kids all in the front of the store and they\\u2019re unsupervised kids probably between the ages of six and eight, maybe nine. They\\u2019re throwing toys up in the air and boys are engaged in a cooperative game of something they just invented. There are a few younger kids just staying back out of the danger zone. I think this can\\u2019t be the right place so I go out of the store, read the sign and see that it\\u2019s spelled the same way, and so I re-enter. Now I\\u2019m looking for someone who is running the store. I see an elderly man and it kind of looks like he\\u2019s wearing a paint smock, so I make a bee-line for him. I ask him if he has chalk paint. He says, \\u201cYes, I do. There\\u2019s a selection right over there,\\u201d and he points. I think, \\u201cHow could I have missed this?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking and there\\u2019s a little shelf, probably about five feet tall by about two feet wide by about ten inches deep. It has three boxes in it that look like there might have been a small canister of paint in them at one point, but they\\u2019re all opened. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s why I missed it because it also has a ramshackle assortment of kids toys on it. However, I walk the way he indicated thinking that maybe there\\u2019s something more here than what I\\u2019m seeing. But no. There\\u2019s one small pint of paint in one of the boxes and the other boxes, you can tell there used to be paint in them but they only have the accessories that would have come with the paint. Miraculously, the one little pint of paint is an antique white. I think, \\u201cWell this might work.\\u201d But I still need the other colors. I\\u2019m not really finished. I walk over to the counter with the paint and there\\u2019s a lineup of parents in front of me all asking him questions about their kids. My son is not in the room anymore, but he\\u2019s ten and I\\u2019m not worried. I think he must have found something to do while I\\u2019m doing this. I wander into the back room and there are more kids playing cooperative games. There\\u2019s a shelf full of kids blocks and he\\u2019s over there and helping some younger kids build something big out of blocks. We make eye contact and I shake my head like, \\u201cNo we\\u2019re not ready to go yet.\\u201d But now I know where he is so I walk back out of that room and stand in the lineup of parents at the counter. When it\\u2019s my turn, I say, \\u201cIs this all the apint you have?\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering why would my friend tell me that this guy has a fantastic selection and it\\u2019s excellent. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019ve got a few more boxes behind the counter.\\u201d I look and they\\u2019re identical to the open ones that had been on the shelf and they\\u2019re also open. As he pulls one out I notice that the paint is not the color that it said on the box. I feel an internal eye roll happening in my own body. I think this is going to take forever. Instead I describe the two colors that I want: \\u201cI want a chalky turquoise and a chalky seafoam green.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell I have this one called mint green.\\u201d I look at it and it\\u2019s far too candy-like. It looks like a wedding reception mint. I say, \\u201cNo. That's got too much blue in it.\\u201d Then he pulls out another one and says, \\u201cHow about this?\\u201d It\\u2019s an obvious blue. I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, that\\u2019s too dark.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cHere, well I have these samples.\\u201d It\\u2019s a board that has a fingerprint of paint colors on it with the paint colors underneath. I think we\\u2019re making progress. I actually find the two colors I want and say, \\u201cYes! It\\u2019s these two. Do you have these?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust a minute.\\u201d He rummages underneath the counter. He\\u2019s gone and it\\u2019s like there are stairs leading down to the basement. He\\u2019s gone for about half an hour. I leave the room I\\u2019m standing in because I\\u2019m in danger of being pinged on the head by some flying toy. I go into the other room where my son is and I just sit there and watch the kids playing. About half an hour rolls by and then the man waves at me from the doorway and gives me the thumbs up. I tell my son it\\u2019s time to go. I go back to the counter and sure enough he has the two colors of paint. I pay him and we leave.\"],[\"\\u201cCommunity\\u201d There\\u2019s a lot of mundane stuff that I won\\u2019t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they\\u2019re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she\\u2019s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re not triggered that you see her.\\u201d And my non-dream psyche answers back, \\u201cNo, hmm, I\\u2019m not.\\u201d But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we\\u2019re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it\\u2019s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We\\u2019re having casual conversations. It\\u2019s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There\\u2019s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He\\u2019s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he\\u2019s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he\\u2019s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it\\u2019s odd. I realize as I\\u2019m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn\\u2019t stand living there - one of the things I\\u2019ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that\\u2019s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there\\u2019s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he\\u2019s gathered all these people together. We\\u2019ve all brought our own food. He\\u2019s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who\\u2019s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property\\u2019s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it\\u2019s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it\\u2019s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. \\u201cOh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!\\u201d \\u201cI can store my snowmobile here!\\u201d \\u201cI can put my motorcycle here!\\u201d \\u201cOh here\\u2019s a big place I can take my dog out to run!\\u201d So it\\u2019s this whole building of community and that\\u2019s what the dream was about.\"],[\"\\u201cCottage in Mexico\\u201d This dream begins in the car. I\\u2019m driving with my younger brother. We\\u2019ve driven a long way and that part isn\\u2019t in the dream. I didn\\u2019t know where we were going, but it didn\\u2019t matter, it was a family road trip. I\\u2019m always only there just for the family time. I do get the sense there is wide open blue sky and red dirt. We come to a place where we stop. My brother lets me know that now we are going somewhere else, we\\u2019re not just driving around, we have a destination. We drive through a really dilapidated town. The sky has a certain color because it is reflecting a large body of water. It looks like water is not that far away. My brother drives the car through an area with houses. He says, \\u201cWe bought a cottage.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at a ten by ten shack. The bottom part doesn\\u2019t even have wood. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cReally, you bought that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Turn around behind you.\\u201d I see a much larger building. It\\u2019s also not in very good condition, but it\\u2019s livable. There\\u2019s a great big backyard. We pull the car then my parents pull up - they\\u2019ve been driving towards the same destination - and then my other brother pulls up in his car. So we have three cars. My other brother has the trailer attached to his. We go in the house. We start opening windows, turning lights on, bringing some things from the cars - suitcases and stuff, but no furniture. The cottage is already furnished. There are three floors. The upstairs is a sleeping floor. The main floor is the kitchen and a living area. The bottom floor is one big long room with twenty tables with chairs around them. I realize as I\\u2019ve gone through all the floors that it has been set up as a retreat area. I ask my sister-in-law, \\u201cAre you guys going to start having retreats?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to set it up as a single family dwelling.\\u201d Then we start sweeping. We\\u2019re sweeping out the main floor first and getting the kitchen ready. My stepmom is doing some dishes because there\\u2019s dust on everything. We\\u2019re taking stock of what\\u2019s there. There\\u2019s enough that they don\\u2019t need to bring any of their own stuff. At this point, my young nephew, he\\u2019s only one, starts to get tired. My sister-in-law says we should go upstairs and sort out the sleeping arrangements. I follow her up. The bedrooms upstairs are small. We\\u2019re counting them and trying to see who\\u2019s going to sleep where. When we\\u2019re in one of the bedrooms, I look out the top window to see an amazing view of the ocean. I\\u2019m standing there looking at it for a little bit. My nephew crawls over and I can feel him tugging on my leg and he\\u2019s standing. I pick him up and we\\u2019re both looking out the window at the water. My sister-in-law comes over and says she has a bath ready for him. She takes him. I find some sheets.i\\u2019m starting to put them on all the beds. I finish that. I can still hear my nephew and sister-in-law in the bathroom. I go downstairs and my brother is in the kitchen. I ask him, \\u201cAre you guys moving here? This is a long way to go.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve been working from home for a while, so I\\u2019m thinking we can stay down here for up to six months and then we\\u2019ll go back home.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a good arrangement. He says, \\u201cYeah, except I\\u2019m broke now.\\u201d I wonder why he bought this. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did you buy this so you can flip it?\\u201d He\\u2018s really handy. He says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to keep it. My contract is almost due anyway.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking this doesn\\u2019t really add up. I say, \\u201cWell, I'm really going to miss you living down here. Although I've been waiting myself to be able to get a cottage in Ireland or Scotland area, I just love it over there. I can just get something small. But it\\u2019s hard to do those things by yourself, especially if it needs work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I get that.\\u201d Then I go down to the main floor. My sister-in-law is there by herself so I\\u2019m assuming she\\u2019s put my nephew to bed. She opens up one of the cupboards and pulls something out. It looks like a long braid of sweetgrass. It\\u2019s long enough that she\\u2019s holding it in both of her hands. It looks like it\\u2019s been wrapped in parchment paper and it\\u2019s really dry, you can see little bits of it have crumbled off. I ask her what she\\u2019s going to do with it. She says, \\u201cWell, I think I\\u2019ll just burn it and see what it smells like.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking through other drawers for a lighter. I turn around and she\\u2019s found something to light it with. The smell is drifting over to me and I say to her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sweet grass. That smells like marijauna.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh!\\u201d But she continues to smell it. Then I see that my nephew is not in bed, he\\u2019s playing on the floor in the other room. I tell her we need to take this upstairs and open all the windows so the smell doesn\\u2019t affect him. She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She starts following me but she\\u2019s having to walk really slowly because the paper is really flimsy and the stuff is so dry that if you walk fast, it will fly out and get all over the floor which is also dangerous. She\\u2019s walking so slowly that the smoke is filling up the room. I\\u2019m looking around. Now I notice that the kitchen doesn\\u2019t have any windows. We are on the stairs now and I\\u2019m standing behind her to hide her from the others. We get to the next floor and into the closest bedroom. We open the bedroom door and then I say to her, \\u201cWell what are we going to do with it now? There\\u2019s nowhere to set it. Maybe we should just put it out in water.\\u201d She\\u2019s trying to use the parchment paper to pinch the burning parts and put the fire out. She says, \\u201cI think I want to save this.\\u201d I laugh and say, \\u201cI know for those times when somebody else is sleeping.\\u201d We both laugh and I say, \\u201cYeah, there\\u2019s too much of this to throw out.\\u201d Then we both start pinching it to try and put it out. We finish doing that then we wrap it up like a tube and twist the ends - it\\u2019s like a giant long skinny candy. I hear some voices downstairs. We just leave it. We close the bedroom door and go back downstairs to the kitchen. There are two Mexican men and one of them has some paper money in his hand. He\\u2019s talking to my brother. They\\u2019re asking if they can buy the furniture that\\u2019s in the recreation room downstairs. He\\u2019s agreeing to do it. The guy is telling him that he\\u2019s offering him 50 Canadian dollars for each setting. I\\u2019m close enough to see that it\\u2019s not dollars but pesos, but he\\u2019s said it in Spanish and he said \\u201cdolares.\\u201d So when my brother goes down to start counting all the chairs and tables to do the math I run after him to try and talk to him without the other guys hearing me. I say, \\u201cThose aren\\u2019t dollars, they\\u2019re pesos. So he\\u2019s giving you fifty pesos which is way way way less than the dolares.\\u201d My brother is listening to me and we do a calculation and he goes back to haggle with them. I\\u2019m trusting that he now knows the information and will make a fair deal. Now we\\u2019re going around the tables and my stepmother is in the room, too. It\\u2019s dark. We haven\\u2019t figured out where the lights are. The tables are all identical, but the chairs are all different. There are more chairs than tables. I see that there are two press-backed rocking chairs randomly placed at the tables. These rocking chairs are exceedingly more valuable than the other ones. I\\u2019m trying to pull those out. There\\u2019s another chair that is quite intricate and I\\u2019ve put the three of them against the wall. I\\u2019ve set the other identical chairs around the table so they get sold. My stepmom sees what I\\u2019m doing and she\\u2019s also organizing the chairs so that the ones that get sold are the ones of lesser value and also fit with the tables. The men take them out to their truck and disappear. It\\u2019s like a ballroom now. It has a completely different feel with those business tables and chairs gone and just those two rocking chairs and the intricate chair. My stepmom and I place them together in the middle of the room. I\\u2019m thinking it would be nice to have a fireplace here. We leave the basement and go back up. My brother is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWow, I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll ever see you guys again.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, return tickets are $893. That\\u2019s not bad. You can visit and stay as long as you want. All you have to pay for is your flight.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYeah, but I\\u2019d need to bring both of my kids, too, and $893 times three is like $2,900 or something.\\u201d I feel really sad because I don\\u2019t think I can afford to go down and see him when he\\u2019s there.\"],[\"\\u201cDecorating\\u201d I\\u2019m back in the house at W Square. My brother and my niece have come to visit. They\\u2019ve brought some things with them. Everything they bring has to hang from the ceiling. There\\u2019s a swing and a light fixture. My brother has brought so many things for the kitchen that he has built another cabinet that goes where the stove used to be. Now I don\\u2019t seem to have a stove anymore because there are cupboards there now. My niece\\u2019s dishes are in there and there are internal racks so the plates stack on their ends. I look to see what\\u2019s in there and the plates are plastic and made of ivy so they don\\u2019t hold anything. I question why these are so important that they need their own space. My niece replies that she likes how they look. I would rather have had my stove. I\\u2019m saying this out loud and asking my brother his plan for the stove and where he\\u2019s going to put that. He\\u2019s busy putting the new light fixture up on the ceiling. It\\u2019s about four feet long by one foot wide. There are three wire cages that have round discs on them. The last one is a really long dunce hat shaped cone and it\\u2019s just a bare bulb. It\\u2019s really, really bright. He\\u2019s installing it and he\\u2019s busy with his tools. I go out into the hallway. I\\u2019m putting up the swing in the living room archway. I\\u2019ve got a hook for it. I insert the hook into the stucco of the ceiling and I\\u2019m turning it around and around and around until I feel it grab. There\\u2019s not much hook left and I\\u2019m skeptical that it\\u2019s going to be able to hold any weight once the swing hangs from it. I hang the swing from it anyway with the intention to ask my brother once he\\u2019s done with the kitchen to come take a look and see if he concurs with my conclusion. While that time is passing, I\\u2019ve got two great big vases that they\\u2019ve brought and some flowers. I put one on the table that\\u2019s just inside the hall and another on a long skinny table in the hallway just before the living room. I arrange the flowers in it. I\\u2019m standing back and admiring; I like how these flowers look in the two vases. They make a nice diagonal line of flowers when you open the front door. In fact, they arrange in perspective, one behind the other so it looks like there\\u2019s one giant bouquet of flowers. I think this perspective is interesting. While I\\u2019m kind of lost in that perspective, my niece sits on the swing and is swinging on it. I notice that the hook is separating from the ceiling just as I suspected. I say, \\u201cStop swinging!\\u201d and I grab the swing because I know one more swing would have taken the whole thing right out and some of the ceiling would have come out with it. I\\u2019ve caught it in time and she gets out of the swing. I take it off the hook and get some glue and some of the material that the ceiling is made out of and I put the glue around the hook. I\\u2019m sticking the material with the hook to the stucco ceiling and am repairing the hole. I have this idea as I\\u2019m screwing it back in that now it\\u2019s a permanent fixture and I didn\\u2019t know that they were going to stay forever and now I\\u2019ve made this swing forever. It\\u2019s done now. I go back into the kitchen and we\\u2019re setting up for somegames. My brother has made this big chart and they\\u2019ve gone out to get food. I\\u2019m in the kitchen by myself and looking at what he\\u2019s done and figuring out what everything is for. I still wonder at the practicality of taking up so much space for these plastic plate ivy underlays. I notice that I\\u2019m squinting because the light from the ceiling without a shade over that long cone shaped bulb is so bright. My niece comes in and says, \\u201cOh look, this is supposed to go over the light.\\u201d It\\u2019s this beautiful cone shaped Tiffany lampshade. I put it over the light bulb. It not only makes the light comfortable, but it\\u2019s really pretty. I notice as I screw it over the light that you push it in so it accordion-pleats over itself, so now it\\u2019s no longer this long dunce cap shaped thing, it\\u2019s flush with the other two round plates on the ceiling. I\\u2019m relieved about this. My brother has returned with some games. He\\u2019s got a piece of bristle board that he\\u2019s going to use as a chart to keep track of the scores. He says, \\u201cLook what I\\u2019ve done. I\\u2019ve put your son right across from you on the chart and your daughter on the Y-axis and your daughter across from you on the X-axis. Here\\u2019s the point where you are and I\\u2019ve made it just a heart.\"],[\"\\u201cDeja Vu\\u201d The dream starts where I\\u2019m having a dream that I\\u2019ve had before. I\\u2019m in a different country, I think the UK. I\\u2019m walking down a street. It\\u2019s raining lightly and it\\u2019s dark. There are street lamps that are gas powered - the old wrought iron kind about nine feet high. The streets are made of cobblestone and are a bit slick. I walk through the streets. There are some people around and they\\u2019re wearing overcoats and bonnets. The men are wearing hats with a brim in the front and back. The overcoats have a top layer that comes from the neck and goes over the shoulders to the waist. I walk for a while then I come to the place where I know I\\u2019m supposed to go. I open the front door and walk up the stairs to the second floor and knock on the door. My boyfriend from high school opens the door. Inside, he\\u2019s got art easels and papers and paints and everything strewn around. There are plates with unfinished food. His kids look like they\\u2019ve been there but they aren\\u2019t there right now. I clear a space for myself to sit down. He\\u2019s not really looking at me. He\\u2019s opened the door but he hasn\\u2019t stopped what he\\u2019s doing to ask me why I\\u2019m there or greet me. I know this is typical of him, this is how he works. So I just sit and look out the window until he\\u2019s finished with what he\\u2019s doing. It feels like it takes ten minutes. Then, I don\\u2019t even know what he says to me. There\\u2019s just a break in the focus. I ask him how he\\u2019s been. I know I\\u2019m there because there\\u2019s something wrong with him but he doesn\\u2019t know this yet. Rather than say anything, he gestures with his arm that he\\u2019s been doing all this. He leaves the room and goes to a corner with a pile of stuff. He comes back with something and he shows me sketches. They\\u2019re quite good. It seems like he\\u2019s been working on this project. He starts to get his coat on. I know we\\u2019re leaving out the door to go somewhere else. We go back out onto the street. We\\u2019re going in the opposite way that I came and we go in through another door. It\\u2019s crowded and I don\\u2019t know anyone here, but he does. I\\u2019m waiting for him to finish doing what he has to do here so that I can talk to him. While he\\u2019s talking to a group of people, I\\u2019m looking at some things on a table. There\\u2019s a deck of cards. I take the cards in my hand and shuffle them. Then I lay eight out on the table. I turn over the fourth one and it\\u2019s hand-drawn like a cartoon style. The card shows a group of people. I hold it up and see that one of them is my high school boyfriend. I look and it\\u2019s a card that shows him sitting in the booth where he\\u2019s sitting surrounded by the people that are there including the ones that have their backs to me and the ones that are silhouetted. I put that card back down on the table. Then I turn up another one. It\\u2019s his apartment when he was younger before his hair was grey. It\\u2019s drawn in cartoon style. The drawings are done in a black marker, so they\\u2019re black and white illustrations. This one shows him younger working on these projects. So now I don\\u2019t want to turn any more cards over until I've had a chance to talk to him. I keep the ones that are still in my hand in my hand. I\\u2019m just waiting for him to finish. I can hear the hum of voices but I\\u2019m not really listening or trying to pull any conversation out. I\\u2019m just waiting and kind of disengaged because I\\u2019m focused on something else. Time passes, maybe a half hour, and he\\u2019s finished. He comes over. I know we can leave now. I show him the first card I turned over where he is the age he is now. He looks at it and pauses. Then I say to him, \\u201cThese look like your drawings. Did you draw these cards? Did you illustrate them?\\u201d I know as soon as I say it that he did. He looks thoughtful. Then I gather up the cards and take them with us. We walk back to his apartment. I sit down again. He goes back to his easel, his drawing board, and begins to draw. I know I\\u2019ve seen this before and have been here many times. Then the dream flips a switch. I\\u2019m at some kind of get together or dance. I see his parents. His mom is all excited because he\\u2019s coming home. She asks me if I\\u2019ve seen him yet. I say, \\u201cNo I haven\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you should come by.\\u201d I think she gives me a date. She says, \\u201cCome by and have some snacks with us.\\u201d I tell her that I will. I do. His family is there. I spend some time talking with his sisters. It\\u2019s joyous. It feels like Christmas. I\\u2019m talking to one of his brothers. I know I should tell him something, but I don\\u2019t get the chance because there\\u2019s so much talking and too many people around. Then he\\u2019s gone and he\\u2019s gone back to the UK.\"],[\"\\u201cDestruction of Kittens\\u201d The snippets of the dream I remember of last night are of being outside. I\\u2019m an observer. I\\u2019m watching leopards, I think, stalking each other and just generally exist in the undergrowth of the forest floor, like a rain forest. There are vines growing between trees and a lot of colors of underbrush. It\\u2019s quite lush. There are blooms, as well. The trees are tall and thin. I can see these large cats stalking each other in the shadows of the trees and pouncing playfully as cats do. Then I look from straight ahead to the left, so my head is turned about ninety degrees of what it just was. I see in the undergrowth a nest of kittens, really young, the kind that aren\\u2019t up and running yet, but folded in upon each other and sleeping as a unit. There are four of them. I\\u2019m aware that the mama is closeby but she\\u2019s stalking something. I just watch them sleeping. You can see the belly breaths, the way all babies do when they sleep breathe. I\\u2019ve missed a snippet. The next thing I notice is this long vine that\\u2019s being whipped back and forth so it\\u2019s really tight. It\\u2019s without discretion cutting everything it comes in contact with as it whips back and forth. It crosses over the nest of kittens and they are destroyed, splattered all over the area.\"],[\"\\u201cDinosaurs\\u201d I\\u2019m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We\\u2019re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she\\u2019s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she\\u2019s telling me these things, she\\u2019s asking me what I think. I\\u2019m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I\\u2019m doing is I\\u2019m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we\\u2019ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, \\u201cMy coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.\\u201d She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I\\u2019ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it\\u2019s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it\\u2019s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it\\u2019s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They\\u2019re wrestling with each other but they\\u2019ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They\\u2019re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I\\u2019m stunned. I\\u2019m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it\\u2019s winter and it\\u2019s freezing. Now I don\\u2019t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they\\u2019re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don\\u2019t seem to see where I\\u2019ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I\\u2019ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they\\u2019re looking around but their bodies aren\\u2019t moving, They haven\\u2019t located where I am yet. They\\u2019ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I\\u2019m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can\\u2019t leave them in there! There\\u2019s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they\\u2019ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they\\u2019re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can\\u2019t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn\\u2019t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he\\u2019ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I\\u2019m up to now and they\\u2019re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to shred the door. I don\\u2019t have any boots and it\\u2019s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don\\u2019t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I\\u2019m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I tell her what happened. She\\u2019s strangely puzzled and doesn\\u2019t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cDownward Dog on a Shelf\\u201d I\\u2019m in a basement or a living room that has no windows. There are a lot of people. I see my brother and my stepmother. There\\u2019s something I have to do. I climb up onto a shelf that\\u2019s about eighteen inches wide and maybe four feet long. It\\u2019s tricky to get up there. There are other items on the shelf like it\\u2019s decorated for Christmas. There are pine bows and some Christmas cards. The arrangement goes up the wall and there are a lot of different cards that people have sent to my stepmother. While I\\u2019m up there, I crawl onto my hands and knees, then I lift my knees up and I\\u2019m in a downward dog. I realize I can\\u2019t back down and I\\u2019m stuck up there. I\\u2019m there for a really long time. My legs and arms start to shake. I say, \\u201cI need a little help here, please.\\u201d It\\u2019s still a few minutes before my stepmother comes over to help. She says, \\u201cOkay, what can I do to get you down?\\u201d I ask her if she can move the items off the shelf. She carefully takes them down. There\\u2019s a glass dome - the kind that would go over a lamp - and all these other things I\\u2019m afraid of breaking. She takes them down one by one, thenI can get back down onto my knees, move my hands towards them, then back to the end of the shelf where I can dangle my legs over the edge, hang on with my hands, and kind of jump down the rest of the way. When I get down, I realize that the ornamentation has gone all the way down through the wall. She\\u2019s trying to give people some things to take home, so she has more things to put up there. I\\u2019m being asked if I can take some of the things home, but I don\\u2019t really want them. But I agree anyway. Then, people say it\\u2019s time to sit at the table. Everybody, there\\u2019s about eighteen to twenty people, come to the table that is also so decorated I can hardly move. There is a full place setting with two forks, a knife, a spoon, side plates and multiple glasses. There are all these decorations around them, too. I\\u2019m supposed to be presenting a ring to her in commemoration of some kind of anniversary. I find this out just right now and I\\u2019m being told to sit at the head of the table instead of the side. I\\u2019m sitting there and while we\\u2019re waiting for a few other people to get to the table, somebody reads a poem. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019m going to be required to present something via poetry, also.\\u201d I don\\u2019t have a poem ready and didn\\u2019t even know I was supposed to do this. I leave the table and go back into the living room and am looking at bookshelves. They are filed alphabetically. I think, \\u201cWell, her name starts with M, so If I look under M, maybe I\\u2019ll find something.\\u201d So I pull out this tiny book of Psalms. I look under M and it skips it - it goes from N to P, so I can't find M and O. I put that book back on the shelf and pull out another book that looks like it might be Psalms and poems. I pull it off and it says it\\u2019s M on the outside, but everytime I look at it, there are no M\\u2019s. I close the book and look at the spine and it does say M, so I\\u2019m looking through it again and feeling like I\\u2019m running out of time and people are going to be sitting down and I don\\u2019t have anything prepared! So now I\\u2019m just taking a random book and reading through the poetry. I think it doesn\\u2019t suit her, so I put it back. I think maybe I just didn\\u2019t read it properly because I was in such a rush and maybe it would have suited her. I pull another book off the shelf and do the same thing. Then I see that everyone is at the table, including her. Now I just have to wing it. I put the book back and go back to the table. I don\\u2019t know what to say. I\\u2019m feeling really stressed. When I sit down, there is all this sticky stuff on my forearms from the table. I start to brush it off. My brother says, \\u201cOh, I took a long time putting that there and I liked it that way.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh sorry, I didn\\u2019t realize that was part of the decor. I thought it was just crumbs.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m trying to put it back and smear it around so it looks like it did before I was there. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cFeed Your Eyes\\u201d I\\u2019m in a hospital waiting room. I have a couple of people with me that feel like friends. It\\u2019s my turn to go to the desk and check in. The nurses are continuing to do work in front of us. There are three nurses that are all part of the check-in, so the people who are waiting can go from one to the other or the other to keep the line moving quickly, so it\\u2019s not a three part check-in process. The one to my left is moving her line pretty quickly. The one in front of me and the one to my right aren\\u2019t doing anything, they\\u2019re just writing at their desks. I\\u2019m kind of lost in my head, patiently waiting for them to finish up their paperwork, although I am starting to feel uncomfortable on my feet and in and around my hip. I\\u2019m thinking there was no point in them calling us up if they weren\\u2019t ready to take us. Then I realize that we\\u2019ve been standing there for an hour and five minutes. I say, \\u201cExcuse me, what are we waiting for? My surgery is supposed to start and I was here at the time I was required.\\u201d The nurse in front of me says, \\u201cThe lights are too bright. We\\u2019re waiting for them to dim.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s not really reasonable because the lights always look like this. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s irrelevant and I need to get to my surgery. Are you going to give me my papers or not?\\u201d She huffs and then signs them off and hands them to me. I can overhear her telling one of her colleagues right in front of me that I said the lights weren\\u2019t going to get any less bright than they were now and she\\u2019s rolling her eyes. I go back to the waiting room and my two companions say, \\u201cWow that was a really long time. I hope you can still make your surgery.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes it was,\\u201d and they gather up their things and we go into the area that we\\u2019re supposed to go into next. There are a lot of hallways. It\\u2019s a very busy ward. I realize I need to use the washroom. There\\u2019s someone going into the washroom - it\\u2019s someone who has just had surgery and she\\u2019s pulling her IV pole along with her. I think, \\u201cOh no! She\\u2019s going into the washroom. I\\u2019m already late and I really have to go in there first.\\u201d Then I see another bathroom just around the next corner. I go in there and go quickly. I can feel the release in the dream in my bladder that built up while I was standing for the hour and five minutes waiting. Now we\\u2019re looking for my surgeon. I realize I\\u2019ve had this exact same surgery before. Then I realize I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m having it again, but I do hope we find the same surgeon. He\\u2019s an older man with very white hair and he was very intelligent and friendly and humorous and he told me stories before and after my surgery. I had the memory that he was still telling me stories when I was under the anesthetic because my subconscious remembers some of the fibers. Then I see him around the next corner and I\\u2019m so relieved that I\\u2019m going to get somebody competent. At this point, my friends sit down in the waiting area immediately across from the cubicle that has a drape around it where the surgery will be. None of this is sterile at all. They help me get up on the stretcher and then they sit in some chairs. As I\\u2019m wondering if the surgeon remembers me he says something to the effect that I know he remembers me. He\\u2019s already starting into the recitation of a long epic poem and it calms me. I\\u2019m really glad he\\u2019s doing this. As he\\u2019s doing this, he\\u2019s also telling me to count backwards from 10, 9, 8, \\u2026 and I can feel the effects of the anesthetic starting to numb my body, but part of my mind stays awake. I feel that he\\u2019s making an incision from my right hip, up my right side, across my collar bones, then down my left side. He peels back that piece of skin so my organs are bared. I feel him checking that everything is working. My mind\\u2019s eye sees the surgical gloves. He\\u2019s compressing some organs and manually manipulating them to ensure that they\\u2019re functioning properly. There\\u2019s a long living sponge that runs below my liver on the right side kind of behind it. It\\u2019s supposed to be breathing and moving things down, filtering them, before they go into my intestines. He takes his surgical tweezers and pulls this up and looks at it, making a noise that says, \\u201cOh we can\\u2019t have you like this.\\u201d He replaces it with a brand new living sponge of exactly the same proportions, then he manually manipulates it with the gloves and watches it work. He\\u2019s talking out loud as he does this. He makes the description of what he\\u2019s doing poetic - he\\u2019s rhyming. It\\u2019s like years and years of practice with surgeries has given him this underlying poetic sense of how the internal organs of the body work together. Then he repeats the process once the sponge begins working autonomously. He goes back through the process of manipulating each of the internal organs to make sure that the rhythm they function within is going with this new sponge. He\\u2019s kind of waving his arms in the air like he\\u2019s conducting some kind of music. He puts the tweezers down, then rolls the skin back from my hip over top, and he smoothes it with his hands. He\\u2019s getting all the air bubbles out. He finds little pockets where air is in and he smooths it out until he\\u2019s happy with it. Then he begins to stitch it up. Then I can hear him once I\\u2019m all stitched. He gives my heart an extra thump and tells me it\\u2019s time to wake up. I think I\\u2019m awake already. Then I hear him say in a poetic voice, \\u201cAlthough the sleep is nice, it\\u2019s time to wake up,\\u201d and he\\u2019s encouraging me to do this. Then I realize I\\u2019m not awake. I start to try and exert my will over my body. My eyes open and he says, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s good, I thought you were slipping away there for a minute.\\u201d I realize I can speak out loud and ask why I had to come back and have this same surgery again. He makes a poetic remark about the first sponge that was in there not doing what it was supposed to be doing, but I\\u2019m not to worry, it\\u2019s taken care of and my job is to stay with us and trust. I don\\u2019t know if I say this out loud or just think it, but he seems to understand: \\u201cI will as long as you\\u2019re here to fix me up.\\u201d He feels like a grandfather, really warm and vibrant. I trust this man completely and hope that if I ever have to come back, he\\u2019s still there doing these surgeries. A nurse opens the drapes of the cubicle, the surgeon departs, and my friends come and help me up off the gurney, one under each of my arms. I realize I\\u2019m still wearing this surgical gown. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhere are we going so i can change into my clothes?\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure how I get my clothes and don\\u2019t remember putting them on, but now I\\u2019m wearing them. My friends are no longer holding my arms and I\\u2019m just walking. There\\u2019s a door in the hall and I\\u2019m on a different floor in the hospital. I open up the door. I\\u2019m still wearing the bib thing around my neck, but have pants on now. There is a group of employees in this room and they\\u2019re sitting behind a desk that you\\u2019d sit behind if you were in school. I know they\\u2019re supposed to be standing up and exercising. I\\u2019ve been in this room before and taught here before. There\\u2019s exercise equipment in here. I\\u2019m asking a couple of them why they don\\u2019t want to get up and start to move their bodies. One lady replies with her hands crossed over her chest as she slumps back, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the point?\\u201d She\\u2019s just comfortable sitting there and doesn\\u2019t feel like getting up. I think that maybe they just need some encouragement. I turn the music up and start moving to the music. I\\u2019m not doing systematic exercises, I\\u2019m just moving. Then someone else gets up and someone else gets up. There\\u2019s about eight people and we\\u2019re just dancing. Then I start doing more exercise, like aerobic moves and some people are joining me. I think, \\u201cOh good, that got them going.\\u201d Then I walk out the door and they\\u2019re all up and moving around. Now my two companions and I are exiting the hospital. I\\u2019m walking through the city. It\\u2019s moving from daylight to dusk. I notice spongey stuff on the ground just off to the right of the sidewalk. The road is to the left. There\\u2019s a combination of goose shit and dog poop on the spongy stuff. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s disgusting.\\u201d We walk a little bit further. I realize I don\\u2019t have my shoes on and my feet are getting a little bit sore. The man in front of me has a cane. I think to myself, \\u201cOh I could really use one of those right now to take some of the pressure off my feet. Suddenly there\\u2019s a cane in my right hand. I lean on it to take some of the pressure off my left foot. But I don\\u2019t like what this is doing to my gait, it\\u2019s making it lopsided. I wonder if it would be better not to use the cane and just tippytoe through this, or if it\\u2019s good for my body to switch it from one side to the other so at least one foot gets a rest. But then we\\u2019re finally home and I don\\u2019t have to worry. I want to have a bath then find my shoes and socks and get dressed properly and get this hospital bib out from around my neck. I go in my house. My two companions are still with me. It\\u2019s a wood house. The wood siding is horizontal and they kind of overlap on each other. I like it. There\\u2019s no basement. It\\u2019s like a cottage. There\\u2019s a big room. We have a grey water system so it collects rain water that we use in the kitchen to wash dishes. I\\u2019m hauling it so I can fill up the bathtub. I get distracted from this. I never get to have my bath. Something is going on outside of the kitchen window. I see that the gravel just outside is on top of a raised deck. My two companions are out there with tool belts and toolboxes. They\\u2019re in the midst of a renovation. I ask, \\u201cWhat is it that you\\u2019re doing?\\u201d I realize that one of them is a fairly old man. He says that he has a surprise for me and they\\u2019ve been working on it since I\\u2019ve been in the hospital and I\\u2019m really going to like it. He\\u2019s excited as he\\u2019s talking and now I\\u2019m excited by what they\\u2019re doing to the house because I love renovations and I love innovation, invention. I can\\u2019t wait to see what it\\u2019s going to be like next. There\\u2019s a wood ladder that\\u2019s more like a permanent set of stairs that you can lift and move around. You know how ladders go vertically up and down? This one is at an angle and is safer because you don\\u2019t have to hang on by the edges. I realize we\\u2019ve been using it for a while to go from the ground up to the top of the desk. Now there\\u2019s another room attached to the deck and the renovations are happening before my eyes. All of a sudden, the cabin is more polished with bigger rooms. It feels like a beautiful house with wood and stone. It\\u2019s not opulent though, there\\u2019s nothing that isn\\u2019t necessary, it\\u2019s just newer wood and the rooms are bigger. The green technology that we used for electricity and water is still in place, it\\u2019s just a century newer and greener. Then, I realize I\\u2019m quite attached to the one older man and want to hear about how he built this. I ask if he can tell me the story and he\\u2019s happy to. We sit down in one of the new rooms. I\\u2019m looking for the old room and realize it\\u2019s been integrated with the new room. The moss that had collected on the roof and boards outside has gone and it\\u2019s somehow refurbished. We sit down and he starts talking about how when he was younger he used to build things for his cars, making highways and roadways for them. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just like how I did with your daughter.\\u201d I remember playing with her myself and how she used to be fascinated with building structures and moving cars through them. I think, \\u201cHow marvelous to start something as a child, interacting with things in your environment, and to be able to engineer beautiful big structures that people can actually inhabit and live in and that function so intricately with the elements in the environment.\\u201d I\\u2019m so happy to be part of this kind of lifestyle. Then this is like an inserted memory from the future. I can see the man and my daughter on a beach. There\\u2019s something they made out of sand that goes up one side, over the top, then down. It\\u2019s a shape. If you look at it from the side, one side is tall and the other is floor level. But if you look at it from the front, it\\u2019s curved. It\\u2019s all one structure. It could be the back of a seat if you wanted it to be, but it\\u2019s not. They made it out of sand and covered it with a substance with some viscosity to it, it might be a combination of slime and water. The cars slide down through it. My daughter drives a car up one side and lets it go, so it slides down the other side. I\\u2019m marveling at the engineering of it. I ask the man, \\u201cHow did you know to make this?\\u201d He takes what looks like a dinky car, but must not be, and he scoops up water from the ocean into it. Now it looks like a scoop. He\\u2019s holding it in front of her face and tilts it up slightly. He has his hand resting at the back of her skull. He says, \\u201cbecause always remember to feed your eyes.\\u201d He dips the liquid from the ocean into each of her eyes and she blinks and they\\u2019re clear and blue. I think, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s exactly what I always want to remember.\\u201d The conversation concludes. Then, we go down the stairs. Now I\\u2019m using that same cane as the other man and I\\u2019m back in the bib again. It\\u2019s a funny redo of the dream. There are too many people on the sidewalk so I\\u2019m forced into that spongy area that I\\u2019m not wanting to walk on. I\\u2019ve got all this goose shit and dog shit stuck in my bare feet. Now there\\u2019s a sole of a shoe like a sandal on my foot, so it\\u2019s squishing all this shit into my foot. I\\u2019m trying to find a spot to shake it off my feet. I feel disgusted and want to go back home to wash my feet off and have a bath. The thing with the spongy material on the side was like an insert into the dream, not a memory, but something that happened in the future.\"],[\"\\u201cFitness Classes\\u201d I\\u2019m eating lunch with a friend at a table. I see that there are people dressed in fitness gear. They\\u2019re walking toward people one table over from us and I can\\u2019t see who it is. My friend says that it\\u2019s Candace. I ask one of the people that are walking by, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on over there with the fitness gear?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, Candace is starting to run her own fitness facility and people are applying for the job.\\u201d I think I could do that. But I don\\u2019t have any paper with me or a resum\\u00e9. I\\u2019m looking around on the table for something I can use as a piece of paper. I\\u2019m asking my friend if she has a paper or a pen. I\\u2019m trying to write my experience down. I\\u2019m seeing people over there who have absolutely no experience at all, but they\\u2019re saying they do and they\\u2019re just dressing the part. I wonder why she hasn\\u2019t asked me because we\\u2019re friends on Facebook and she knows I teach these classes. I wonder if I should even bother applying. My friend convinces me that I should and finds a piece of paper. I begin to write and the pen has a really fat nib and my writing looks terrible; the ink is blotchy. I only get three sentences written when we\\u2019re asked to leave the table. I\\u2019m trying to write the rest of this out but i can\\u2019t find a flat surface. The pen looks like a marker with the tip squished down so it\\u2019s fat and there\\u2019s hardly any ink in it. It just looks awful. I do, however, finish writing it out. I put it in a piece of paper and go to give her the envelope. She acts like she doesn\\u2019t know me. However, I leave it on the table and I walk away.\"],[\"\\u201cFor a Little While\\u201d I\\u2019m in a village. It\\u2019s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don\\u2019t live in houses. It\\u2019s outside living. People\\u2019s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I\\u2019m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it\\u2019s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I\\u2019m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I\\u2019m waiting for her dad. I know he\\u2019s there but he\\u2019s invisible. He has a presence but I haven\\u2019t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we\\u2019re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I\\u2019m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It\\u2019s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there\\u2019s food you can eat with your fingers that\\u2019s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we\\u2019ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there\\u2019s privacy from everyone else\\u2019s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He\\u2019s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He\\u2019s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he\\u2019s still there in spirit but in the flesh he\\u2019s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we\\u2019re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She\\u2019s looking around. I think to myself, \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for the parents she doesn\\u2019t have.\\u201d I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I\\u2019m happy to look after her. She\\u2019s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter\\u2019s father. I miss that he can\\u2019t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.\"],[\"\\u201cForgiveness\\u201d In my dream I\\u2019m at the studio I\\u2019m trying to leave because of their lack of integrity and their manipulative behavior. There\\u2019s people - it\\u2019s almost like something has happened in the outside world and there\\u2019s refugees, just people that are lying in cots, like hospital bed cot in the studio. The studio is full of people. They\\u2019re not practicing yoga or anything - well, not in the physical sense, but they are in the spiritual sense. People are nursing other people. I\\u2019m not even sure what the wounds are because they\\u2019re not really obvious. But some people are not able to get up off the cot and other people are. So the \\u201cnursing\\u201d seems to be more on a spiritual level. So I\\u2019m involved with this and I\\u2019m just circulating among the people, soothing, easing, doing what I can. At one point somebody needs something, so like in dreamtime consciousness, the studio is all of a sudden larger than it actually is in real life. Hallways appear and I\\u2019m going down these hallways into empty offices that have been abandoned and looking for supplies. There\\u2019s a bit of an adventure where I don\\u2019t meet anyone, I\\u2019m just going down this labyrinth of hallways and checking to see if I can find things that will help other people and then bringing them back in, leaving them with someone else who will take care of the person while I go off and then hunt down something else that might be of use to someone else. After one of these trips, the person who seems to have the most issues - none of them are visual, I can\\u2019t see them bandaging bleeding wounds or anything, it\\u2019s just trying to get this person things so that they are able to have mobility again and get up off the cot. So this is where I\\u2019m entering into the busy studio atmosphere again where I see the owner - the one who has been manipulative and lied. She\\u2019s tending to this person and she has a completely different approach to what mine has been - she\\u2019s changed the approach of treatment so that all the things I have gathered, she\\u2019s now said won\\u2019t help and her idea of what will is now being accepted and used to tend to this person\\u2019s wounds. So I just look at that and think, \\u201cWell that figures, that\\u2019s something she would do.\\u201d Then I move on to see where else I\\u2019m needed. While I\\u2019m collecting up stuff that they\\u2019ve deemed unnecessary, I\\u2019m thinking how can I repurpose this in case someone else needs it. She goes back to her desk and makes an announcement like the way somebody at a toast would make some kind of noise to get everyone\\u2019s attention. So she does something and everyone\\u2019s looking at her and she says: \\u201cIn honor of her service here, we have decided to give Freya 25% off of all the services we offer at the studio.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! What the hell?\\u201d Then everybody\\u2019s looking at me, so I have to go up and say thank you. As I do, I give her a hug. I feel like I\\u2019m forced to do this, but I don\\u2019t want to, I don\\u2019t even want her stupid 25% off. I don\\u2019t like the big deal she\\u2019s made out of this, so the whole way I\\u2019m feeling resistant. But as I hug her, I feel she is a skeleton underneath her sweater. She\\u2019s literally skin over bones. I have this moment of compassion for her where I feel through her body, her own journey has led her to do what she\\u2019s doing and in her own way, she\\u2019s helpful and she\\u2019s done this at a detriment to herself. I feel all this inner turmoil also going on in her. I feel sorry for her and I think I should forgive her for being who she is and I still don\\u2019t like it. So it\\u2019s like feeling forgiveness, compassion and resistance all at the same time. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGetting Ready to Cast Off\\u201d I\\u2019m on my friend Lynn\\u2019s sailboat. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We\\u2019re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I\\u2019ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I\\u2019m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we\\u2019re waiting because the wind has died down. We\\u2019re waiting for the wind to pick up. There\\u2019s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It\\u2019s really silly. I\\u2019m on this dinghy and it\\u2019s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I\\u2019m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I\\u2019m hanging on to the mast and sail. It\\u2019s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I\\u2019m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, \\u201cHmm, I could actually fall asleep here.\\u201d I\\u2019m in danger of doing so. I think, \\u201cWell, I better not fall asleep.\\u201d So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, \\u201cWell, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.\\u201d I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I\\u2019m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I\\u2019m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it\\u2019s not in the dreamscape anymore. I\\u2019m swinging around on this rope. I\\u2019m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I\\u2019m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I\\u2019m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I\\u2019ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn\\u2019t get tangled on anything. Now I\\u2019m wondering what else I\\u2019m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they\\u2019ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, \\u201cOh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I\\u2019ll paint rocks.\\u201d So all of a sudden, there\\u2019s another person who I actually work with, though I\\u2019ve never sailed with her - I don\\u2019t think she sails. She\\u2019s been invited to go on the boat. I\\u2019m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she\\u2019s doing to pass the time and she\\u2019s painting rocks. I think, \\u201cWell this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she\\u2019s used.\\u201d I kind of go up tentatively because I don\\u2019t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, \\u201cWhat kind of paint are you using for that?\\u201d She tells me that it\\u2019s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, \\u201cNo, I just came back from Michael\\u2019s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they\\u2019re doing something that\\u2019s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.\\u201d So I ask her where it is and she says, \\u201cHere, it\\u2019s on this map and it\\u2019s marked with an X so that we don\\u2019t go there.\\u201d I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don\\u2019t want Lynn to know I\\u2019ve gone to Michael\\u2019s as well because she\\u2019ll be upset. So I think, \\u201cI\\u2019ll just go to the Dollar Store.\\u201d As I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store, I don\\u2019t have any shoes. I\\u2019m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they\\u2019re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I\\u2019ve got a bag. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I\\u2019ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It\\u2019s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we\\u2019re going to cat off. But we don\\u2019t! It\\u2019s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she\\u2019s been sewing something. She asks me if I\\u2019d like to make something. I say, \\u201cWell, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you\\u2019re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it\\u2019s very cooling. So I\\u2019ll make one of those.\\u201d So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That\\u2019s the end of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cGoats and Ethics\\u201d I\\u2019ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I\\u2019m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I\\u2019m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, \\u201cHmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really find any. Then I decide I\\u2019m not worried about it because I\\u2019ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I\\u2019m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I\\u2019ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don\\u2019t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I\\u2019m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He\\u2019s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, \\u201cYou have to see this, come with me.\\u201d We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn\\u2019t a yard; it\\u2019s a pool of water. But it doesn\\u2019t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, \\u201cThis is just amazing. You have to see this.\\u201d We bend down and look into the lake. She says, \\u201cLook what I found.\\u201d I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it\\u2019s not made of cement; it\\u2019s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, \\u201cLook! It\\u2019s a goat path.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don\\u2019t understand how it\\u2019s for goats.\\u201d So we\\u2019re kneeling at the side and she says, \\u201cLook.\\u201d I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re post holes.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.\\u201d She presses something and they start to go up - they\\u2019re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, \\u201cAt one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.\\u201d I think, \\u201cI wonder what the value is in that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell they would have used it when they were threatened.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, then, still I don\\u2019t understand what the goats did.\\u201d Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it\\u2019s not wood that things are made of and the reason they\\u2019ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, \\u201cWow, this is incredible.\\u201d Now other students are coming out and it\\u2019s 4:30. I realize it\\u2019s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can\\u2019t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can\\u2019t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.\"],[\"\\u201cGrandpa T\\u201d I\\u2019m in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house on North Shore Blvd. I seem to spend a lot of time there alone, wandering around from room to room. It\\u2019s a really big house. The odd thing is that my grandparents are sleeping in the room I always slept in when I was there and I am sleeping in their room. But this one particular day, I get up in the middle of the night and they\\u2019re still sleeping. I walk down the long hallway into the kitchen. I just sit there. There was never a table in the middle of the kitchen in real life, but there is in my dream. I sit down at it. I feel like there is the presence or essence of other people coming in and out of the kitchen. I\\u2019m just sitting there feeling into them. I notice the dynamic between them in a way I never did when I was a child in that house. I\\u2019m noticing personalities and why they act the way they do. I spend a few hours doing this in the kitchen. Then I get up from the table and go over to see if there is anything on the stove. I make sure all the burners are off. Then I walk down the hallway into the room my grandparents used to sleep in. I get into the bed and lie there for a while awake. As I\\u2019m lying there, my consciousness wanders out the sliding patio doors into the grounds that are around the house. I notice that there\\u2019s a musty smell I\\u2019ve never noticed before. It\\u2019s coming from what would have been the east side of the grounds. There\\u2019s some soggy area - a bit of marsh - that I\\u2019ve also never noticed before. I attribute that to the musty smell. Then my consciousness goes down to the boat house. I feel this mixture of fear at how big it seems to me or that it doesn\\u2019t seem big on the outside, but on the inside it yawns back into the ground. There\\u2019s this big boat in there that doesn\\u2019t seem like it would possibly fit when you look at the boat house from the outside. The discrepancy between what it appears to be on the outside and what it actually houses on the inside is what gives me that little bit of fear. My consciousness comes back around up to the top where there is a greenhouse. I notice that it was barely ever used. There are a few remnants of plant pots and projects that were started and never finished. Then I go over to the sunroom, which is outside, and I sit there. It\\u2019s still nighttime. There\\u2019s the sense of disuse there as well. I also feel like there\\u2019s some leftover bits of gatherings. I think, \\u201cWell, at least this got some use.\\u201d Then as I\\u2019m sending there, I notice my grandfather is beside me, sitting on another chair. He\\u2019s complaining about why it takes my grandmother so long to do everything. I lean over and pat him on the arm the way a parent would. I say, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s because you\\u2019re so picky. If you weren\\u2019t so focused on details all the time, she wouldn\\u2019t take so much time trying to fulfill them for you.\\u201d He sits back in his chair and appears to be thinking about this. He\\u2019s considering it. I leave him there and go back into the house. I go through the living room, through the hallway, and down the stairs to the basement. There are a lot of things piled up in there. I consider that they\\u2019ve never really gotten rid of the stuff that their own kids left behind when they moved out. I\\u2019m thinking and wondering why this is - what sense of something seemed to stop and not move on for them. My feet feel the cold of the floor and notice it\\u2019s marble. I think, \\u201cWow, a lot of the materials used in this house are very expensive.\\u201d The room has a fireplace at one end. I remember as a kid being allowed to create a fire there but there was no arrangement of chairs around it or of it ever being used by people sitting around the fireplace and just gazing at the fire. I feel a little bit sad at how the basement isn\\u2019t a lived in space. It\\u2019s more a storage place for memories that aren\\u2019t really integrated into life. So I go back up the stairs into the living room. I sit in one of the charis and notice that there is a rectangle in the wall. It looks like it has a little door in it and I\\u2019ve never noticed it before. It\\u2019s very tiny - probably about 6x4 inches. I open it up and there\\u2019s a key inside. I\\u2019m sitting there with a key in my hand. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy would somebody go to the trouble of disguising this passageway into the inner walls and not lock it and just leave a key in it?\\u201d The key has some meaning, and I\\u2019m wondering what it is. As I\\u2019m sitting in the chair, my grandmother comes and sits beside me. She says to me, \\u201cYou know one of my favorite things about this chair is?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt opens up to a bed.\\u201d It\\u2019s a single chair. She shows me how you can push it back like a recliner. The part you are leaning on flops out once. The part where your legs are flops out. A person can sleep comfortably there overnight. I say, \\u201cOh, that is a really good idea.\\u201d I tell her that my space is very, very small. I indicate from the end table over to one couch. Then I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s how big my entire living room is.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well that couch pulls out into a bed, too. If you had these two pieces of furniture, you could double the size of your space because then you wouldn\\u2019t need one of your bedrooms.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a really clever idea. Then she walks away down the hall and goes back to the bedroom. I just sit there in the living room. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much of my grandmother is there actually in this space?\\u201d I wonder if she was ever able to use her brilliant mind that I knew her to have beyond the house. In my dream, I feel some anger directed to my grandfather. It\\u2019s like it comes out of my body in a concentrated shot towards him. Then after it does, I feel bad because he\\u2019s a nice man. Then he appears beside me in the chair in the living room that my grandmother was sitting in. I can tell from his demeanor that he\\u2019s not upset with me at all. He has felt my anger, but it\\u2019s not something he\\u2019s ever felt against himself at one point. We sit there in companionable silence. I leave him there and go back to the bedroom and get in bed.\"],[\"\\u201cGrapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water\\u201d This dream starts in my house. It\\u2019s not the house I currently live in; it\\u2019s not a house I\\u2019m familiar with at all. I\\u2019m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we\\u2019ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It\\u2019s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It\\u2019s beautiful. It\\u2019s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don\\u2019t say anything. We\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cYep, this is going to be good.\\u201d We go in. There\\u2019s an older woman who is taking people\\u2019s names. She\\u2019s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it\\u2019s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person\\u2019s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it\\u2019s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people\\u2019s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We\\u2019re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she\\u2019s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it\\u2019s like a black walnut dark. It\\u2019s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people\\u2019s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It\\u2019s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re standing on. I realize what they\\u2019re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life - they\\u2019re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it\\u2019s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I\\u2019m on a rollercoaster, but it\\u2019s moving through the church. I can see the track that it\\u2019s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there\\u2019s no track after that and we\\u2019re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don\\u2019t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It\\u2019s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That\\u2019s where everybody is going. So we\\u2019re new and we follow the crowd. It\\u2019s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I\\u2019ll slide backwards, but I don\\u2019t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there\\u2019s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there\\u2019s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It\\u2019s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I\\u2019m sitting in, I realize it\\u2019s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it\\u2019s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We\\u2019re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it\\u2019s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I\\u2019m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I\\u2019ve noticed that we\\u2019re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We\\u2019ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it\\u2019s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we\\u2019re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn\\u2019t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: \\u201cHave we contributed to this in some way?\\u201d So there\\u2019s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we\\u2019re just supposed to help make it or if we\\u2019ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there\\u2019s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I\\u2019m asking her if she knows where we\\u2019re supposed to be at what time. She says, \\u201cOh yes, I still have that information, it\\u2019s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven\\u2019t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you\\u2019d be back.\\u201d That\\u2019s just a memory. Then the people we\\u2019re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We\\u2019ve walked down this path from the church - it\\u2019s a dirt path that\\u2019s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren\\u2019t in an urban area. It\\u2019s like non-urbanized, but we\\u2019re not in the woods because there\\u2019s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can\\u2019t see what they are. It\\u2019s not just a dock, it\\u2019s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we\\u2019ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I\\u2019ve recently noted that he\\u2019s involved in this conspiracy group and they\\u2019re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He\\u2019s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it\\u2019s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we\\u2019re with take the cloth off the boat. I\\u2019m happy to see it\\u2019s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: \\u201cYou know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI do, but it\\u2019s not mine. Whose boat is it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn\\u2019t here and this other person who I don\\u2019t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it\\u2019s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I\\u2019m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I\\u2019m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it\\u2019s okay. He says, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It\\u2019s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I\\u2019ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I\\u2019m checking out the rigging.There\\u2019s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They\\u2019re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it\\u2019s a weird place to have this because normally they\\u2019re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can\\u2019t see what the operate. I\\u2019m trying to figure this out. The ship\\u2019s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I\\u2019m looking at it I\\u2019m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I\\u2019m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they\\u2019re not even ships at all, but they\\u2019re bobbing up and down so they\\u2019re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I\\u2019m off the boat of the woman who I didn\\u2019t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that\\u2019s okay because I didn\\u2019t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don\\u2019t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he\\u2019s not there. So I text him and ask him if he\\u2019s going to be sailing today. He says, \\u201cYes. Just wait there and I\\u2019ll be down at my boat in a moment.\\u201d My daughter and I wait. We\\u2019re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We\\u2019re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, \\u201cOkay, are you guys ready to go?\\u201d We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it\\u2019s right up against the dock and as we look in, it\\u2019s so deep that it\\u2019s black - you can\\u2019t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it\\u2019s so long I can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s enormous. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGutting the Backpack - Lucid Dream\\u201d This is one of those lucid dreams where you just close your eyes for a moment and your body is rooted down despite the fact that you feel like you want to get up and move. I\\u2019m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There\\u2019s liquid or digestive juices with it. I\\u2019m horrified for a moment, then I think: \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s not an animal, that\\u2019s a backpack!\\u201d The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It\\u2019s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn\\u2019t open it with a zipper.\"],[\"\\u201cHigh School, Again\\u201d The dream starts off and I\\u2019m in something that looks like a school. It\\u2019s quite a big building with a couple floors and has the feel of a high school. There are lockers lining the hallways. It\\u2019s the expanded version of high school but doesn\\u2019t look like the one I went to - it just represents high school. In one of the rooms, there are four large round tables, but they\\u2019re really low to the floor like you\\u2019d see in a daycare. There are chairs around the tables. There\\u2019s a bathtub with a shower curtain pulled across it on one side. Across the hall from this room - and the hall is lined with lockers - is a doorway that leads into my apartment. All I see of my apartment is just the one room you enter. So as you open the door, it goes into a living area. There is some living room furniture like a couch and a couple other chairs for single people, some end tables and lamps. There\\u2019s a closet with a cheap sliding door where coats are hung. It does look like there\\u2019s a kitchen off to the right although I do not enter it in my dream. In my dream I leave my apartment, walk across the hall and see that people are starting to gather around the tables. I see a couple friends from high school. I\\u2019m still friends with one of them even though she\\u2019s moved quite a distance away. It doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s been a long time because we do message on Facebook. She stands up and I give her a hug. Then we both sit down at the table. I\\u2019m having trouble fitting my adult size body under the table - my knees don\\u2019t fit under because the table and chairs are so low. I kind of sit sideways to the table and rest my elbows on the top. Then I see another person that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. She moved right out of high school and she and her husband live out west. I\\u2019m really happy to see her and give her a big hug. She says, \\u201cOh my goodness, that was a really strong hug.\\u201d She\\u2019s laughing and I\\u2019m laughing, too. I tell her that I\\u2019ve been working out and my arms are strong. There\\u2019s some kind of job that I\\u2019m to start in February that requires upper body strength. I say, \\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t always been like this, but I really wanted the job. So in November I started lifting weights with my arms. Good thing it\\u2019s only December! If this were February, I might have squeezed you harder!\\u201d She laughs. We sit down at the table. Again, it\\u2019s hard for me to get my legs under, so I sit sideways with my elbows on the table. Other people join us. We\\u2019ve taken out our lunch and are eating a little and chatting with light-hearted humor. I notice behind me that there\\u2019s a different group of people starting to assemble at the other round table. I notice Lisa - the friend who betrayed our friendship. She also betrayed her own brother\\u2019s wife. It\\u2019s the brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends that are starting to gather at the table behind me. I\\u2019m aware of this out of my peripheral vision. Then I need to go into the washroom, so I excuse myself and get up from the table. I go to the bathtub with shower curtain. I\\u2019m not having a shower. I don\\u2019t remember using the toilet or sink. I just go in and pull the shower curtain across. I\\u2019m in there for a few minutes then come out again. Now I see that Lisa is sitting at the table with her brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends. They all have stony looks on their faces. She has her arms folded over her chest. I think, \\u201cUgh, why is she even sitting there? I wonder what\\u2019s going on with that. They look so awkward and agitated.\\u201d But I\\u2019m glad she didn\\u2019t sit down with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I\\u2019m hoping as I walk back to my table that she won\\u2019t look at me. She doesn\\u2019t, which is good, and I sit back down with my friends. Then, we\\u2019re finishing our lunch and it\\u2019s time to go somewhere else. Everyone else in the room has cleared, including Lisa. There\\u2019s only one person left at the table where I was sitting and I\\u2019m wanting to clean it up. There are rolls of paper towels which actually look like toilet paper rolls. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s a good idea to cut paper towel rolls in half because people only normally need a little bit anyway.\\u201d I remove a couple pieces and wipe up the table. Then I take the rest of the paper towel which is now opened. I set it in front of my apartment door. I\\u2019m tidying up and putting everything away. At this point, a few people start coming back into the room. It\\u2019s all clean and lunch has been put away. Somebody says, \\u201cWhere are all the paper towels?\\u201d As I\\u2019m about to indicate that I\\u2019ve put everything away, there\\u2019s a rumor flying around the room. The rumor is an embodiment of itself where it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s more than one voice talking at once. I can hear phrases like, \\u201cWho would take all the paper towels? Why are there no paper towels? Has anyone reported this?\\u201d I think, \\u201cWh? Was there supposed to be a lot of paper towels in here?\\u201d I\\u2019m about to indicate that there were no other paper towels in here and I have a roll right there, but all these rumors with false information got together and now there were supposed to have been three boxes of paper towels lined up against the wall and they\\u2019re all missing. The janitor is going to be upset. I say to someone, \\u201cWell why doesn\\u2019t someone ask the janitor if there\\u2019s supposed to be three boxes here? Ask where they\\u2019re supposed to be kept. There\\u2019s no point getting all upset about this.\\u201d Then I point with my finger and say, \\u201cLook! There\\u2019s a partial half roll right there. Let\\u2019s use that for what we need and then go and retrace the steps of where these have all gone.\\u201d Nobody is listening. Then I see Lisa look at it. She\\u2019s adding to the rumor that I\\u2019ve stolen all the paper towels. I\\u2019m trying to explain to people that I just cleaned up and wiped up all the tables. I put the half roll in front of the door because I didn't know where it went and didn\\u2019t want to leave it on the center of the table. No one is really focused on any one certain thing and no one is asking the janitor where they\\u2019re supposed to be or if in fact any are missing at all. Maybe he hasn\\u2019t brought them up for the day.\"],[\"\\u201cI had a dream that I got the cover of Yoga Journal.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cKeep it Small\\u201d There\\u2019s some kind of outdoor grouping. There\\u2019s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I\\u2019m not there to particularly attend. It\\u2019s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I\\u2019m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son\\u2019s friend\\u2019s moms, Melissa. She\\u2019s Noah\\u2019s mom. She\\u2019s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: \\u201cHere are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don\\u2019t react.\\u201d The lecturer doesn\\u2019t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, \\u201cAnd this is how you can keep it out of your face.\\u201d I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn\\u2019t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I\\u2019m asking her: \\u201cAre you buying into this? What do you think?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for some time now.\\u201d She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn\\u2019t had any \\u201caction\\u201d in quite a few months. I say, \\u201cWell, maybe that\\u2019s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you\\u2019re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That\\u2019s a good thing!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She\\u2019s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn\\u2019t anything to be outrageously happy about. I\\u2019m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that\\u2019s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn\\u2019t be able to pull so many people into this. It\\u2019s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it\\u2019s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I\\u2019m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I\\u2019m at home. I\\u2019m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it\\u2019s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I\\u2019m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I\\u2019m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I\\u2019m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I\\u2019ve got orange and blue in there now. I\\u2019m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.\"],[\"\\u201cLighthouse\\u201d All I remember is crawl-climbing up a really, really steep slope with rocks on it. I\\u2019m on my hands and knees. There\\u2019s a lighthouse at the top and it\\u2019s on. There\\u2019s a beam of light that goes around and around. I\\u2019m alternatively bathed in light, then in complete and total darkness.\"],[\"\\u201cLima\\u201d This dream starts as though I\\u2019m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There\\u2019s a function, so it\\u2019s quite crowded and there\\u2019s a lot of people, most of whom I don\\u2019t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There\\u2019s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there\\u2019s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it\\u2019s over and it\\u2019s been over for some time. He\\u2019s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I\\u2019m reading the letter, it\\u2019s two pages long and there\\u2019s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, \\u201cDid he say anything to you personally?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just news.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m reading it again. There\\u2019s a story about his cat named Lima. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, what\\u2019s happened to him?\\u201d because he has two of them and he\\u2019s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I\\u2019m reading that the cat is missing. He\\u2019s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that\\u2019s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he\\u2019s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I\\u2019m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what\\u2019s in the letter like he knows what\\u2019s in the letter and he\\u2019s going off about what\\u2019s in the letter. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what\\u2019s in here.\\u201d Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I\\u2019m over in the UK, which is a trip I\\u2019ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I\\u2019m over there. So now I\\u2019m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I\\u2019m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I\\u2019m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I\\u2019m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There\\u2019s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it\\u2019s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend\\u2019s flat and knock on the door. It\\u2019s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It\\u2019s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it\\u2019s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he\\u2019s asking me how my trip was. I\\u2019m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, \\u201cYes, one of my daughters is here.\\u201d Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.\\u201d That\\u2019s all he says. I know from that remark that she\\u2019s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she\\u2019s with some of her friends. They\\u2019re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she\\u2019s changed it to Grassy. I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.\\u201d She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, \\u201cIt was nice to see you.\\u201d I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I\\u2019m talking to my artist friend. I say, \\u201cOh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can\\u2019t keep up with it.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019ve each got some of you in them.\\u201d He kind of laughs and I ask him if he\\u2019s found his cat. He says, \\u201cNo, not yet.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, I saw the cat.\\u201d And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, \\u201cHmm, let\\u2019s just go check that out.\\u201d We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cLittle Animals with Trunks on the Movie Set\\u201d This dream starts at the restaurant where I worked while at university. It\\u2019s a continuation of another dream where I heard they were hiring and I brought my application in. It starts by me meeting there with a bunch of other people I used to hang around with when I worked there. We are meeting there and it\\u2019s a Sunday night. We\\u2019re going to see a concert and the reason we\\u2019re meeting there is because the manager or one of the bartenders (I\\u2019m not sure who) has picked up a bulk purchase of tickets and we have access to them as employees at this bulk rate. I\\u2019ve been included in this. I\\u2019m feeling hopeful that I have a job there because I\\u2019ve been included. So, it\\u2019s shift change and I'm sitting at the bar with everyone else. Some of the staff are eating, which is typical - they\\u2019re getting their meal at the end of their shift. Some staff come in earlier and eat their staff meal before their shift starts. So there are a lot of people around and it\\u2019s a festive atmosphere. The people that have finished their shift are buoyant because they\\u2019re counting their tips. The people that are starting their shift are buoyant because there\\u2019s an anticipation of the money they\\u2019re going to make. There\\u2019s always good music playing there. I see people I went to highschool with. Their uniforms are all fresh and I can tell they\\u2019ve just been hired that day. I have a conversation with two of them. The tickets go around and I take mine. We\\u2019re figuring out who\\u2019s going to carpool with who and in what car. We\\u2019re waiting for the schedule to go up because it\\u2019s Sunday night. George, the manager, disappears into the back and somebody comments that he\\u2019s taking a long time to work on it. The crowd is thinning because people have finished their meal or left with their ticket and carpool or are on the floor starting to take care of their section. I\\u2019m still waiting to see if I\\u2019m on it because I\\u2019ve been included in this. George hasn\\u2019t come out from the back yet. I ask the owner who personally gave me a package with my ticket in it. Now I remember that they also had a small birthday celebration for me. Several people have given me a birthday gift and I didn\\u2019t expect this. I ask the owner if he knows if I\\u2019m on the schedule. He says he doesn\\u2019t know. He takes my hand and then leaves. One of the other managers is standing there, so I ask him. He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He has a sad look on his face. I feel really dejected and don\\u2019t even want to go to the concert now. I\\u2019m wondering why not only everybody who used to work with me has been re-hired, but these other people that went to highschool with and who never even worked there before have been hired. I leave. I get on the bus to go home. The bus is leaving and it does go down P. Road, but it stops and I disembark. It\\u2019s not just a bus stop, it\\u2019s an intersection of all different kinds of transportation. There\\u2019s a big ship at the dock. There are skateboards. There\\u2019s a snowmobile. There are other things I don\\u2019t remember. At first I choose a skateboard and it\\u2019s interesting because it is snowing. I\\u2019m surprised that as I go up a hill with snow that I can maneuver on this - it\\u2019s a combination of pressing my right foot down, then the left foot lifts up a little, and then you use your body weight and your center of gravity to heave it forward - it\\u2019s similar to skiing. I get up this very small hill then get some momentum and it\\u2019s going along in the snow. When I look down I can see the snowmobile tracks in the snow and they\\u2019ve hardened a bit in the cold, and it\\u2019s actually helping my skateboard to move along. I do this for a little while then get off the skateboard. Now I\\u2019m on some other kind of vehicle. It\\u2019s flying over the snow and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It has a steering mechanism. I am zooming along. It\\u2019s wide and there are a couple other people on it. I look over to the side and there are trees flying by. I can see an animal through the trees. I can\\u2019t figure out what kind of animal it is. At first I think it\\u2019s a warthog. Then I think it\\u2019s too big to be a warthog. Then I get a better glimpse of it. You know when things are speeding by and at first you can\\u2019t see something but then it\\u2019s almost like the thing that are speeding by are so fast that it looks like a motion picture and you can see what the other object is? It looks like a hippopotamus except it has wings and a trunk. Then I see all these other strange pictures. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow! This is the set from a Harry Potter movie!\\u201d I get excited about this. We get off at the next stop. Now my son is there and he gets off with me. I say, \\u201cDid you see that?!\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe animal through the trees!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, what did you see?!\\u201d I describe the process of first thinking it was a warthog then realizing what it was. He says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go take a look at the set!\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYou know what? If that\\u2019s the movie set, then we could actually rewatch that movie and look carefully at that scene through the trees and maybe see us flying by.\\u201d He gets really excited about this, too, and we decide to do that when we get home. Then we walk back the way we came on the vehicle. It\\u2019s taking us a little while to walk because we need to go back to that intersection of vehicles in order to get on one that will take us home. We\\u2019re almost there. We\\u2019re walking down the little hill that I skateboarded up with the snow. Then we decide to go off to the left and see if we can see anything else from the movie set. We get closer to it and there are extras and the caterers and those kinds of people milling about and doing their thing. There\\u2019s a commotion. We follow along with the crowd so we can see what the commotion is about. It\\u2019s a horse and it\\u2019s kicking another horse. I\\u2019m horrified. It\\u2019s just awful. I can hear the people on the set gasping and saying, \\u201cTake that thing out of the horse costume!\\u201d What\\u2019s happening is one of these trunked creatures is dressed up as a horse and the other horse thinks that the first horse\\u2019s spirit is bad so it\\u2019s kicking it because it doesn\\u2019t understand it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s another creature in it. They get the first horse calmed down and they remove the horse skin from the other one and put it into this pen. But the pen is a pit. There are a whole bunch of them in it and it\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s so inhumane. They\\u2019re all writhing around and all you can see are these little trunks. It\\u2019s so awful I wake up because I can\\u2019t stand looking at this or seeing this.\"],[\"\\u201cMain Duck\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It\\u2019s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There\\u2019s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There\\u2019s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there\\u2019s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That\\u2019s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend\\u2019s son who I\\u2019ve sailed with before. We\\u2019re having something to eat. I\\u2019m not very hungry. I\\u2019ve brought a few things to eat that I just don\\u2019t feel like eating right now, so I\\u2019m just waiting. People are deciding what we\\u2019re going to do for the day. We\\u2019ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It\\u2019s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There\\u2019s a town and we\\u2019ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I\\u2019ll just eat there when I\\u2019m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They\\u2019ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can\\u2019t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I\\u2019m hoping there\\u2019s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There\\u2019s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it\\u2019s really messy. I\\u2019m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There\\u2019s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, \\u201cWow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she\\u2019s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we\\u2019re just staying for three days. That\\u2019s okay because there\\u2019s not a lot to do here and I\\u2019d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don\\u2019t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We\\u2019re back in the reception room. The owner\\u2019s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he\\u2019s going to leave right now because it\\u2019s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he\\u2019s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend\\u2019s boyfriend tells me that we\\u2019re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that the opposite direction?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the direction we\\u2019ve been going.\\u201d I say, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I indicate where we\\u2019ve left from and where we\\u2019ve tied up and I say, \\u201cThis is south.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo here, I\\u2019ll show you on a map.\\u201d He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship\\u2019s made and we\\u2019ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We\\u2019ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn\\u2019t make any sense to me.\"],[\"\\u201cMis-Match\\u201d I\\u2019m at some kind of outdoor gathering. There are two fields and a little bit of a marker that separates one field from the other. In one of the fields people are just enjoying themselves, random socializing and conversations. In the other one, there is a big table. We have to match five bundles to five names and there is a keycode that goes with it. This has to be done before you can freely join in any of the other games. I was in the social field and then in some way I was alerted or warned that I had to go match these bundles with the keycode. So, I leave. I walk up the field to the table. The little bundles are almost like medicine bundles. They\\u2019re pieces of cloth tied with bits of leather. Some of the leather has beads on the end. In addition to the leather tie is a small tag. The keycode is really worn. It\\u2019s like a piece of canvas with lists on it. The lists are so worn that they\\u2019re really hard to read. I\\u2019ve got five of these little medicine bundles. Each one belongs to somebody that\\u2019s there. I have to find the name on the keycode, then transfer the keycode onto the little bundle\\u2019s tag. The first thing is that the marker doesn\\u2019t work on the tag. It seems to work for others, but it\\u2019s not working for me. It takes a little figuring and decoding because they aren\\u2019t just regular names, there are numbers. You have to translate the numbers, do some math in your head, look on the canvas, count some things, then calculator in your name, then translate this back onto the tag. So, because my marker doesn\\u2019t work, I keep forgetting all the calculations in my mind. I am getting really frustrated because it\\u2019s not working. Everybody else is going up, finishing tagging and coding their bundles, then going back to the games. So I\\u2019m still there. Other people come in. Someone takes the marker. I have to wait and can\\u2019t find the canvas legend. The marker doesn\\u2019t work. Then everyone is finished except for me and I\\u2019m still sitting there. A woman named pauses for a moment from having fun and tries to help then just disappears. I look and see all the people that were in my social group but are now no longer in the bottom field and have left and gone on to do something else. I do eventually finish. The reason I finish is because I just wrote with the marker that didn\\u2019t work. I put it on there even though I knew it probably couldn\\u2019t be seen by anyone, then left the table and walked back down. But by this time everyone else has gone. When I get back to the bottom field, someone tells me that the older group of people I was hanging out with have moved beyond that field to a different area. I start to go look for them. It\\u2019s harder to see where people are here, which is why it\\u2019s for more experienced people. It\\u2019s forested or something. It\\u2019s hilly. The terrain is more rough. I don\\u2019t find who I was looking for. I\\u2019m kind of absorbed by this other group that\\u2019s traveling. They\\u2019ve got a handicapped person in their midst; it\\u2019s like they have hemophilia and can't be jostled around or bumped. There\\u2019s a special diet that goes with this young boy. He has parents in the group. The parents are being irresponsible with how they divide the resources. Each group has five people in it and these five people are supposed to accomplish something. But they\\u2019re giving all their resources to the son and not to any of the other people in the group. I can see that there is in fact plenty to go around. Some of the things they\\u2019re giving him, he doesn\\u2019t even need and they\\u2019re not necessarily good for him given his condition. So this starts to frustrate me, as well. Where we\\u2019re sitting is dark. They\\u2019re at a wood table. I\\u2019m not even sitting at it. I\\u2019m sitting at the one behind, and I\\u2019m supposed to be sitting with them. I get frustrated with this unfair allocation of resources. I\\u2019ve tried to negotiate with them, but they keep ignoring me until finally I release some of this frustration with a verbal blast. But that doesn\\u2019t do anything either. They just look at me, pause for a moment and go back to what they were doing.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Cat\\u201d I\\u2019m entering my house after being away for four days. I realize that I had forgotten to leave food out for my cat. I notice this because normally she comes to the door to greet me. She didn\\u2019t. That was the first thing I noticed. I\\u2019m wondering where she is. I start to look through the house for her. Then I realize I didn\\u2019t leave food out for her and it\\u2019s been four days. I\\u2019m afraid she\\u2019s dead. I\\u2019m running around the rooms looking for her, seeing all the favorite places where she would lie. I can just feel how tight my heart is getting and my throat. I don\\u2019t find her anywhere. I come back down into the kitchen and I see her at her food and water and she\\u2019s eating.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Grandmother\\u2019s Shoes\\u201d I\\u2019m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I\\u2019m at the dining room table. There\\u2019s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It\\u2019s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I\\u2019m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s her or someone else. Maybe it\\u2019s her with someone else\\u2019s face but she\\u2019s not alive anymore. Here she is and she\\u2019s acting like Nancy but she doesn\\u2019t look like her. We\\u2019re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they\\u2019ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad\\u2019s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, \\u201cNo, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.\\u201d I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she\\u2019s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they\\u2019re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, \\u201cThese don\\u2019t look very comfortable!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYou might be surprised. Try them on anyway.\\u201d So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It\\u2019s too small and it\\u2019s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d I put it back in the crate. She says, \\u201cTry another pair.\\u201d I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they\\u2019re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they\\u2019re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there\\u2019s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren\\u2019t completely flat, they\\u2019re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it\\u2019s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, \\u201cGrandma, I\\u2019m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.\\u201d They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re a seven anymore. I believe I\\u2019m now an eight. But isn\\u2019t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say anything, but she says, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can\\u2019t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, \\u201cWait here one moment.\\u201d She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, \\u201cTry these ones on.\\u201d She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they\\u2019re flat and they don\\u2019t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they\\u2019re comfortable. She says, \\u201cYou can have them.\\u201d She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, \\u201cAre you guys ready to go yet?\\u201d They\\u2019re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re wearing Grandma\\u2019s shoes.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cYes, she gave them to me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.\"],[\"\\u201cNo Voice\\u201d This time the setting is different. I\\u2019m in a mall and I\\u2019m teaching yoga. I\\u2019m not in a room so there\\u2019s just posts and no walls. It\\u2019s a designated area for my yoga class but there aren\\u2019t any walls. The mall is packed, there\\u2019s lots of shoppers. People are going about their own business. The people that have come in for yoga have intentionally come for the class. However, I\\u2019m unable to organize them. The time I\\u2019m supposed to start the class, they\\u2019re still talking to each other. It\\u2019s like they can\\u2019t hear me. It\\u2019s like trying to shepherd chickens. They\\u2019re running all over the place. I\\u2019m trying to get their attention and I\\u2019m trying to teach. As soon as I get them organized with their mats down, I say about six words and they\\u2019ll wander off again or start talking to each other or look at something from a window that\\u2019s in the mall. At one point, out of frustration, there\\u2019s a carny with a headset on. I walk over and say to them, \\u201cI notice you\\u2019re not using your headset right now. Is it okay if I borrow it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d So I put it on. He shows me how to use it and I walk back over. It works for about 6 seconds. Then the class is the same. Now 35 minutes have gone by and I haven\\u2019t even started my class. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cOld Wrongs\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of strange building. I don\\u2019t know what it is, it\\u2019s the upper floor of something. There\\u2019s a hallway with a niche off to one side with two couches facing each other. There\\u2019s a long room that\\u2019s empty. I\\u2019ve been teaching in the long room - meditation, it\\u2019s a yoga teacher training. It goes really well. I\\u2019m happy with the session. The studio owner I used to work for is sitting on the couch when I come out after the session and she says to me: \\u201cI have no further need of your services. How much do I owe you?\\u201d She gets out a checkbook. I tell her that she owes me for all the sessions she booked me for, not just the one I finished today. She says, \\u201cOh I don\\u2019t have to pay you that.\\u201d I explain that she does because I turned down other work in order to hold those days open for her. Then she kind of freezes, the way they do in plays where one person freezes then the spotlight turns to something else. I see sitting on the couch across from us, a student of mine. He tells me that she has hired him to work for her. I say, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I\\u2019m debating whether or not to share with him how she treats people, just to warn him. Before I can say anything, he says to me, \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s asked me to come in for the next couple of Sundays just to see how I do.\\u201d I say, \\u201cIt sounds like you\\u2019re volunteering.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, she said that if I do a good job, she\\u2019ll pay me at some point.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you okay with this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cEh well, I was going to be around anyways, so I don\\u2019t mind doing it.\\u201d He tells me the times and dates that she asked him to come by and teach her group. It\\u2019s the other two dates that she booked me for. I\\u2019m thinking that just figures, she\\u2019s found a way to get someone to teach for free. He seems really uplifted or excited by the idea that he\\u2019s just a new fresh grad and already teaching a teacher training. He\\u2019s confident and stuff and I don\\u2019t really want to take that away from him, but I\\u2019m also really disgusted by this kind of treatment of the sacred teachings of yoga. There\\u2019s no way anyone fresh out of a 200-hour teacher training is experienced enough to pass on any kind of wisdom. She\\u2019s just using it as a money maker. I feel this frustration combined with disgust welling up inside me.\"],[\"\\u201cOlive Oil\\u201d I\\u2019m not really anywhere physical. I feel like I am the macro and the micro sensation of passing of time. There\\u2019s a physical feeling of motion, of waves, of something small like iotas touching my skin and letting me know that I have a physical body that exists somewhere. Because my eyes cannot really see anything but daylight itself, I attend to the feeling on my skin to determine where I am. I sense rather than see a wooden floor, a planked wooden floor and walls also made of wood. It\\u2019s like I can feel vibration. I\\u2019m now sensing that there are other people and I sense an elderly man with the energy of a patriarch, but loving like a grandfather; then that softer more active love of a matriarch or grandmother. They have family. I can feel they are tied together by the vibrational quality of love, affection, interaction, and connection. They are bubbly. There\\u2019s joy here. There's also a sense of industry and cooperation. I feel now that there is a rhythm in the dynamic of their extended family. At the same time as I\\u2019m sensing into this, I\\u2019m feeling like the whole scenario is moving forward. As I deepen into their family dynamic, I start to see more colors and form. I start to see that they\\u2019re seated, they\\u2019re boisterous and talking to each other. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a mealtime, though they aren\\u2019t eating food. They\\u2019re passing around something in a cup. Their family is colorful. There\\u2019s something wrapped around the woman\\u2019s head. There\\u2019s the draping of brightly colored cotton clothing, although the man seems to be wearing a shirt. I notice their skin is glowing. There\\u2019s a sense of emanating light. Then I think that their whole skin is softer and more radiant, even of the family members\\u2019 whose arms and hands I can see. I seem to be zooming in and noticing that the hands are luminescent. It suddenly clicks in my mind that I can smell olive oil. Then, it further connects that what they are passing around in the cup is olive oil and there\\u2019s this joy that they have in this olive oil. I realize they\\u2019ve produced it together and it\\u2019s what is making their skin so luminous. Then, I can feel the vibration of the olive trees through the wood. I\\u2019m thinking or feeling that the planked floor also comes from the olive tree and that this forward motion, this macro-sensation is the journey of the olive itself and the family that gathered around it to tend it. As I start to ascend from the wooden planked room with the family who tends the olive, I\\u2019m sensing how disconnected this is now that it\\u2019s moved forward through time and becomes the glassy cage of the olive.\"],[\"\\u201cOpen Air Concert\\u201d I\\u2019m standing in a crowd in a large fairground area. There is hard packed earth and grass underneath my feet. It\\u2019s dark - it\\u2019s night time. The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn\\u2019t say anything but I know it\\u2019s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There\\u2019s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he\\u2019s somewhat hard although I don\\u2019t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There\\u2019s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren\\u2019t sitting down though, they\\u2019re just standing up. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don\\u2019t want to sit with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I\\u2019m looking for Trent because he\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen and know. I don\\u2019t find him.\"],[\"\\u201cRe-living the Move\\u201d I\\u2019m re-living what I\\u2019ve been doing this last week, which is helping my daughter move from a big house into a tiny apartment. I\\u2019m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m in the kitchen and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m up in the attic and there\\u2019s stuff there. There\\u2019s a whole other apartment\\u2019s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she\\u2019s ever had since she was a kid and it\\u2019s all just everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess and it\\u2019s not sorted. She hasn\\u2019t packed any of it into boxes and she\\u2019s asking me to help her, but she\\u2019s not ready. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I\\u2019m in the attic and my friend is there. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s helping, she\\u2019s just sitting there and she\\u2019s talking. Her mood is light and she\\u2019s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They\\u2019re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They\\u2019re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I\\u2019m reaching in and at first I\\u2019m pulling out things that are just garbage and I\\u2019m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn\\u2019t belong with the toys. My friend says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and she says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let\\u2019s do it!\\u201d She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn\\u2019t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don\\u2019t really want to do this because I won\\u2019t be present for what I\\u2019m packing. Then I realize that maybe that\\u2019s silly because I\\u2019m just packing and maybe I don\\u2019t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn\\u2019t really affect me. It actually tastes like water, so that\\u2019s kind of strange.\"],[\"\\u201cRed Sand\\u201d I\\u2019m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I\\u2019m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it\\u2019s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it\\u2019s actually ending. She\\u2019s co-teaching with another person I\\u2019ve never seen. I think it\\u2019s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I\\u2019ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It\\u2019s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they\\u2019ve obviously already had their asana class and they\\u2019re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it\\u2019s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we\\u2019re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she\\u2019s white, if the whole class was like this or if it\\u2019s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it\\u2019s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I\\u2019m surprised to see her. She says, \\u201cNo, the whole class was like this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d So I ask her, \\u201cIs this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d There are six people. I think, \\u201cWow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.\\u201d Then I say to her, \\u201cI have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.\\u201d I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I\\u2019m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don\\u2019t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that\\u2019s leaving. As I\\u2019m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don\\u2019t even know what they are. But I\\u2019m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith\\u2019s flute looks like an obo, but it\\u2019s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it\\u2019s such beautiful music. You can tell they\\u2019ve played together for a really long time because they\\u2019re really tight together. They\\u2019re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there\\u2019s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I\\u2019ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, \\u201cGood, we\\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\\u201d The music has something to do with what they\\u2019ve been practicing in the class. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, \\u201cI hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.\\u201d We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we\\u2019re at the outskirts of town. He says, \\u201cLook what they\\u2019re going to put on this land.\\u201d He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he\\u2019s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he\\u2019s doing this, I\\u2019m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, \\u201cOh, I think there\\u2019s red clay under this.\\u201d I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, \\u201cLook. There\\u2019s red sand underneath here.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just spray painted. I say, \\u201cI don't think so, it looks real. It\\u2019s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.\\u201d He\\u2019s quiet and doesn\\u2019t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he\\u2019s adding onto it so it\\u2019s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.\"],[\"\\u201cScavengers\\u201d The most meaningful picture from my dream is that everything was burnt. It was like a post after the fire burning of the world. Yet even though there was cooled lava stone kind of shell overtop everything that was alive, there were still some people left. So some people had survived. And some people had scavenged stuff from the rubble or had hammered the crust with something and broken off a piece of some piece of junk - like an item you\\u2019d normally buy in a store, that kind of junk - and had scrabbled a living from this. The people that had done that were emaciated and skinny like skeletons with vacant eyes. Their whole focus was on what they had scavenged and made into a business to sell. They weren\\u2019t chasing me and I wasn\\u2019t running from them. Because I was uninterested in their scavenged things, it was like they didn\\u2019t even notice I was there. So I was able to be invisible. At one point in the dream, one of them looked at me and I still remember that hollow kind of hungry gaze and it pierced me for a second, and then I think because I didn\\u2019t return it, I didn\\u2019t need it - I didn\\u2019t need anything it had, its hunger just retracted and then it was as though I was insignificant and it left me alone. They were quite frightening to look at, so was what they had - it was like things you get from the dump, but there were people that were buying it and it was so awful.\"],[\"\\u201cShady Contracts\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room full of people involved in conversations with each other. I\\u2019m sitting with a group of friends having a pleasant conversation when someone taps on my shoulder and says, \\u201cThat woman over there would like to speak with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little annoyed that I\\u2019m being interrupted during something social to do something that feels like work. I look over that it\\u2019s Claire, a studio owner of someone I used to work with but I\\u2019ve parted ways due to her unethical practices. I refuse to go over there and just tell the messenger that I\\u2019m busy. I continue talking with my friends, but he\\u2019s persistent. He won\\u2019t leave me alone. He stalks me everywhere. So I finally go over there just to tell her to piss off. There\\u2019s a pile of documents on the table and I see they\\u2019re spread out a bit. I see sticking out from one of them, my name. So now I\\u2019m sucked into engaging with them because I want to know why my name is on a piece of paper. They should not have anything to do with me - we never signed a contract, though I always wanted to. So there\\u2019s nothing that has my signature on it. He sees me glance at it and my arm is reaching to pull it out from the bottom. He swipes it first. He is her representative - at some point he\\u2019s told me this or I\\u2019ve just assumed it from the conversation, but he\\u2019s definitely behaving like it now. So I say, \\u201cWhat is that with my name on it?\\u201d He says it\\u2019s a contract. I say it can\\u2019t be because I\\u2019ve never signed anything with Claire here or her studio. He says, \\u201cIt says here that you release her from any responsibility for any shady interactions or any responsibility for her past actions. \\u201c I\\u2019m a little bit outraged and refuse. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m not signing anything like that. It\\u2019s a lie!\\u201d I also don\\u2019t think that she should escape accountability for her actions. At this point she speaks and says she\\u2019s applying for a new business and she needs all her past employees to sign this contract in order for her to have a pristine business record and move forward to something else. I still refuse to sign it because it\\u2019s dishonest. I want the piece of paper and I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking this with me.\\u201d The representative says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take that with you. It\\u2019s a legal piece of paper that doesn\\u2019t belong to you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes I can because it has my name on it.\\u201d Then Claire says, \\u201cYou can take it with you.\\u201d She reaches out to shake my hand and I realize that there\\u2019s a bulky piece of folded up paper in it and something that feels cold, like ceramic. So I look down in my hand and examine the ceramic thing. The closest I can describe it is those ceramic things in old lady\\u2019s bathrooms that you put the end of the toothpaste in and start to roll from the bottom up so that it squeezes all the toothpaste out. It looks like that, but is twice as wide, probably 6 inches wide. There\\u2019s a small chain attached to it. At the end is a tiny hook that looks somewhat like a paperclip that\\u2019s been partially unfolded. I\\u2019m thinking, what the heck is this? It\\u2019s glazed in white with blue and has my name on it. Is this something to mount a piece of paper on? There\\u2019s a hook and chain on it. So I\\u2019m puzzling over this. Then I open up the eight-times folded piece of paper and see that it\\u2019s a check for $201 from her to me. I realize that she\\u2019s trying to pay me for my silence. I still refuse to sign it but I walk away with the check and this bound thing that would bind me to her forever symbolically. Although I didn\\u2019t get the piece of paper with my name on it - I didn\\u2019t sign it. I walk away and I\\u2019m feeling like I don\\u2019t even want this check or this ceramic thing. So I turn around and she\\u2019s still at the table, but I\\u2019m walking towards them and all the footsteps I take aren\\u2019t bringing me closer to the table. I can still see her and I\\u2019m not any closer. This is really frustrating me. Then the scene morphs into I\\u2019m trying to walk through this row of beds, like you\\u2019d see in a television orphanage (I\\u2019ve never actually been in an orphanage). There\\u2019s a bunch of single beds lined up and they all have people in them and all their belongings with them, like homeless people. I have to step over all of them because mine\\u2019s at the very end. It has a change of clothing with a hairbrush, toothpaste, some snack-like foods that come already pre-packaged, like cookies in a bag. There\\u2019s a television there as well. Everyone has their own television and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I guess this is where I have to sleep for now.\\u201d I\\u2019m angry that I have to step over all these people. I\\u2019m angry that someone is partially lying on my own bed. Just as I lie down in it to get comfortable, these two teenagers come up and say that it\\u2019s their turn to have the bed now. They have this piece of paper to prove it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t even notice that was on the piece of paper and now I don\\u2019t have anywhere to sleep and I\\u2019m mad and I\\u2019m swearing and I\\u2019m yelling and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cFine, but you can\\u2019t have it until all my stuff\\u2019s gone. Get out, stand back there and I\\u2019ll tell you when I\\u2019m ready.\\u201d I start taking my sheets and blankets off my bed, and I\\u2019m taking all the little things and putting them in my backpack. I do that, step over all the people and leave really angry. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cSmoking\\u201d I\\u2019m on foot and it\\u2019s nighttime. I\\u2019m walking through a long flat path. There are a couple of other people with me - my ex friend Lisa and Keith - and a couple of other people. It\\u2019s pitch black out, the night sky has no moon and no stars. It\\u2019s not unpleasant - it\\u2019s not rainy or snowy - it\\u2019s just dark. We walk for quite some time. We are supposedly going to Keith\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s a cottage or something. We get there and his mom is home. We are supposed to just be stopping to say hi to her, change our clothes, and then put the boat in the water. I\\u2019ve already walked around the backyard to see where the boat is. I\\u2019m looking at the water. Everybody seems to be taking a long time, so I go back into the house. They\\u2019re involved in quite a conversation with his mom. I\\u2019m waiting for them to finish talking and I sit down. Then Omar walks into the room and he sits down. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re all talking but they\\u2019re not talking about anything, they\\u2019re just waiting. Eventually I sit down, too. I wonder why they\\u2019re sitting and waiting. I wonder what they're waiting for. I decide I might as well have a nap. There\\u2019s a pullout couch and it\\u2019s already been pulled out. I lie down on it. His mom comes over and sits beside me but she doesn\\u2019t say anything. She\\u2019s still in this kind of limbo. I\\u2019m not actually tired, I\\u2019m just lying down. Then the other guys get up as though they\\u2019re going to put their outdoor clothing on. I think we\\u2019re going, so I sit up on the corner on the pullout couch. But they\\u2019re not going; they\\u2019re passing around a joint. Then they go into this limbo again afterwards. I\\u2019m not sleepy, I\\u2019m just lying down because there\\u2019s nothing else to do. It\\u2019s pitch black. We\\u2019ve walked all the way there and I\\u2019m not going to walk home. I can\\u2019t go out in the boat by myself. Nobody is talking. I lie back down on the bed again. Then Keith comes over and he gives the joint to his mom. I wonder what\\u2019s in it and maybe it\\u2019s not a joint, but just looks like one. She puts it to her lips then takes it away and gives it to me. I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder what this is.\\u201d I put it to my lips. The smoke feels weird. I don\\u2019t like it. I take it away from my own lips and give it back to Keith. Then I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re all in limbo. They\\u2019re high.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on a path outside. It feels like I\\u2019m in Canada with meadows and a coniferous forest. I see a snake. It\\u2019s sunning itself and they\\u2019re usually a bit preoccupied when they\\u2019re doing that so I\\u2019m not alarmed and I\\u2019m just watching it. It\\u2019s a big snake, it looks like a boa but it\\u2019s not six feet long, it\\u2019s [probably about four feet long. Maybe it\\u2019s a baby boa. It\\u2019s about three inches thick through the middle. It has a really attractive assortment of markings, pretty intricate with a lot of colors. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m just standing there looking at it, I\\u2019m admiring it. All of a sudden it springs, it recoils, and it shoots itself maybe three or two feet away from me. It does this so quickly that I scream. As I\\u2019m screaming I see that it saw a rat and it just shot itself over to the rat. But I screamed so loud that I actually woke myself up. My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to go back to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cSome Strange Yoga\\u201d My dream setting is in a classroom, like a yoga studio. The floors are wood, there\\u2019s lots of mats laying down, the walls are a warm buttery yellow and the lighting is soft. It looks like a typical yoga studio. I\\u2019m on my mat and I\\u2019m working something out of my body. All the postures that I normally do, I\\u2019m trying them sideways and upside down and backwards. I\\u2019m amazed that this approach is actually working and it doesn't feel strenuous on my body and I wonder why I never thought about doing it this way before.\"],[\"\\u201cSpirit People\\u201d I\\u2019m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they\\u2019re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We\\u2019re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don\\u2019t say anything. I\\u2019m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it\\u2019s on the top floor. She says, \\u201cThis is where we\\u2019re supposed to go - my contact is up here.\\u201d We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we\\u2019re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we\\u2019re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I\\u2019m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, \\u201cWait here. I\\u2019ll be back in a moment.\\u201d So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.\\u201d The first yoga class is all the bride\\u2019s family. They\\u2019re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that\\u2019s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I\\u2019m figuring there\\u2019s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they\\u2019re serving food. They\\u2019re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren\\u2019t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I\\u2019m suggesting we leave. But they\\u2019re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they\\u2019re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person\\u2019s hair. I look and it\\u2019s someone I recognize. I didn\\u2019t know her very well, though, and I hadn\\u2019t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I\\u2019d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I\\u2019m hugging her and saying, \\u201cWow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so very long,\\u201d I realize in my dream mind that she\\u2019s dead. We don\\u2019t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I\\u2019m seeing more people that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there\\u2019s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don\\u2019t know her - we don\\u2019t have any close conversations. She\\u2019s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, \\u201cOh, that can\\u2019t be good and why don\\u2019t you say something...you\\u2019re passive to this?\\u201d Then her son comes up. I just know it\\u2019s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: \\u201cI can tell whose son this is!\\u201d I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, \\u201cAlright, it\\u2019s time to go. We don\\u2019t have anything to do here.\\u201d So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re just gone. I look down and I\\u2019ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they\\u2019re attached. I think, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t mine.\\u201d I know where it\\u2019s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, \\u201cHey, I think this is yours.\\u201d He looks at it and says, \\u201cOh, I haven\\u2019t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.\\u201d I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I\\u2019m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can\\u2019t accept it until I\\u2019ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I\\u2019m waiting and it looks like he\\u2019s going to disappear back into the store and I\\u2019ve still got this pot I\\u2019m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it\\u2019s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I\\u2019m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I\\u2019m walking into Mandy\\u2019s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it\\u2019s been there for ages. There\\u2019s another pair over by the sink. There\\u2019s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I\\u2019m just hearing the voice and deduce that it\\u2019s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It\\u2019s covered with seran wrap. It\\u2019s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, \\u201cOh, she\\u2019s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!\\u201d So, I ask her if she\\u2019d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there\\u2019s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it\\u2019s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He\\u2019s got hair like Mo from the \\u201cThree Stooges\\u201d but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it\\u2019s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he\\u2019s dead and she\\u2019s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I\\u2019m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there\\u2019s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I\\u2019m wearing my own wedding dress. He\\u2019s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He\\u2019s talking to me about something and I don\\u2019t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we\\u2019re in our bedroom and making love.\"],[\"\\u201cStep-Motherhood\\u201d This dream I seem to be a step-mother to two different families. It starts off and I\\u2019m actually unclear on whether I am the first group of kids\\u2019 actual mother or if I\\u2019m their stepmom, but I\\u2019ve been with them for some time. There\\u2019s three boys and a girl. We do live alone. There\\u2019s no man in the house. The boys are all teenagers and they\\u2019re very close in age, like 17, 16 and 15. The girl is a little bit younger, but also a teenager, perhaps 12 or 13. They\\u2019re all in various stages of self-sufficiency and they are aware that we need to be moving soon as I am. Then the scene switches a little bit and I\\u2019m at another house. The house is actually quite spectacular. It\\u2019s a farmhouse style that has had a lot of work done to modernize it and continue to hold its beauty. It\\u2019s not in a town, but there are a few other houses around. It feels like some other people have also chosen not to live in an urban setting and are perhaps because of their own independence, wanting to live off the land and make similar choices, they may be in the early stages of a rural community. But I don\\u2019t feel that it\\u2019s happened quite yet. You can just see that there are other landowners around. The house has a big wide decking around it so you can stand on it before entering. It also feels like it adds to the safety and the way the house is heated and cooled by night and day through this deck and the roof. It\\u2019s like a wide, deep and covered porch. The roof is tiled. The kitchen is interesting, too. There\\u2019s a fireplace in the very center. There\\u2019s a big big wide beam that splits the kitchen in half at the ceiling. The table is built to hug the fireplace and wrap around it in a C-shape. I also notice the water tank attached to the fireplace. I haven\\u2019t quite figured out how it heats the water in the kitchen, but it does. The dream begins with me. I\\u2019m at the table. There are four girls and one boy. The boy is the oldest, probably 11 or 12. The youngest girl is still a baby, maybe 1, possibly 10 or 11 months old. The mom isn\\u2019t there. I\\u2019m not clear if she died or if she left, but she\\u2019s just not there. But she must have been there recently because the youngest is really young. I\\u2019m supposed to be getting to know these kids. I\\u2019m having a hard time keeping their names straight because there are so many of them and they never sit still for very long. The dad is there at the moment. He\\u2019s asked me to bathe them. There\\u2019s a system set up with a pipe that runs up from the fireplace, across the ceiling, down into the room that\\u2019s the bathroom and into the bathtub faucet. I open up the spigot that releases some of that water and am carefully mixing the cool water with the hot water, putting my hand in there and I only fill it about 3 or 4 inches because the little girl is very young. Then I pick her up from the dinner table and take her into the bathroom. At this point, I really get to see her face. She\\u2019s this bundle of joy. She\\u2019s innocent. She\\u2019s happy - you can feel the bubbles of happiness radiating out from her body and she\\u2019s completely trusting of me. Now I can remember her name because I can feel her energy and see her face. So I take her clothes off and I set her gently in the tub and am starting to wash her. The dad comes in and checks on us. He says something to me, but I don\\u2019t know what it is, then he leaves the room. I take the little one out of the bathtub and dry her off. I wrap her in the towel and go back into the kitchen. The dad is there. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s not clearly outlined. I see that he\\u2019s at the sink washing dishes. The kids are rowdy as they sit around the table because no one is really with them and they\\u2019re finished eating. Food is still on the table. I get the next oldest daughter who is a little over 2. I take her by the hand and bring her into the bathroom. Then I put the little one back in. she\\u2019s sitting safely in the bathtub. Then I tell the next youngest one: \\u201cWe might as well get you ready so that you can have the next bath.\\u201d I see her face and she looks different from the first child. She\\u2019s quite a bit darker and has a different character. I can feel how energetically different this child is from the first one. She\\u2019s not as trusting. She\\u2019s a lot more independent. We get her sweater off and her top and her shirt and her shoes and socks. Then I think this is going to be a challenge. The bath water from the first one is still quite clear. The other one didn\\u2019t have anything on her - there were no food bits or dirt. So the bath water is still clean and I think I\\u2019ll just warm it up a little bit and add some bubbles, then put the next daughter in. I do this. Now I\\u2019ve got both of them in the bath at the same time. I\\u2019m washing the second one. The second one has hair so I\\u2019m rinsing it with clear water from the tap. I realize that now the water is going to get too deep for the baby. I take her out and wrap her in her towel again and put her on the floor beside me. I think, \\u201cOkay, how am I going to do this? There are still three more kids to have baths. Who\\u2019s going to look after the first two?\\u201d Then the dad comes in and I\\u2019m relieved. I tell him that the youngest one is finished. He takes her with him. I finish bathing the second daughter. He brings in the third one and leaves her at the door. I coax her in. She\\u2019s a little more standoffish and it\\u2019s taking some time for me to talk to her. Then the scene changes from the bathroom. I\\u2019m outside with them. I\\u2019m showing them a raised garden bed that belongs to me. So I know what\\u2019s in there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, this starts as a seed. See how it hasn\\u2019t grown up yet? It will soon if we water it and give it some sunlight.\\u201d I hand them a watering can and they pour some water on it. Then I say, \\u201cLook, this one is already grown! It already has some fronds on it.\\u201d I clip off two fronds and say, \\u201cHere, rub the leaves a little bit and then smell it.\\u201d They do. It\\u2019s lavender. They really like this and both of them are smiling now. They\\u2019re happy and engaged with the garden. I ask them if they want to bring in this and put it in the bath water. They say yes. Now they\\u2019re both excited. So we go back into the house and back into the bathroom. Now those two are bathed. I changed the water when we got back in. They\\u2019re playing happily in the bathroom with me. It\\u2019s fine. They don\\u2019t need the kind of support the 1-year-old did where you had to hold her and do everything else with one hand. They\\u2019re playing together on the bathroom floor. I change the bath water and put in fresh bubbles. I put them both in the bathtub at the same time and wash their hair. I take them out and dry them off. I\\u2019m wondering where the dad is. I go out to the kitchen. The older girl and the boy are not at the table, but the dishes have all been taken away and the table is clean. So i\\u2019m wondering where to go next with them. I go the opposite way of the bathroom. There\\u2019s a large living room with a fireplace. It\\u2019s sunken a little bit and there are bedrooms off to the side. The girls just run into their own room. I think, \\u201cOh, this is where they sleep.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m a nanny or what. I\\u2019m starting to feel more like a nanny, like a governess. So I help them put their pajamas on, put them into bed, read them a story, and say goodnight. Then I come out and the dad has put the baby to bed. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019ve got a little bit of a breather here. The older kids can bathe themselves. Then just make sure they go to bed.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, got it.\\u201d Then I go back into the bathroom because I still have to clean up from the older twos\\u2019 bathing. I pull the plug. The dad comes up behind me and gives me a big hug from the back. I can feel his heart rate and his breath. There\\u2019s heat between us. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s what this is? Am I stepmom?\\u201d I feel a little confused. The heat is really good and I can feel my body responding. I soften into him and allow this. It lasts for a moment, then he releases me and leaves the room. Then he\\u2019s gone from the house and I get the idea that he works nights. I let the older two know that the bathroom is clean and they come in and do their own thing. I\\u2019m not witness to this. Then they\\u2019re in their pajamas and are sitting in the living room. Now we\\u2019re having a conversation with my own kids from the previous family where I was mother or step-mother or nanny. They are all sitting around. My kids from the first group are older. The kids are deciding whose room is going to be whose and who has to double up. They\\u2019re having this independent conversation. It seems to be working out. Now there\\u2019s a top floor to this house overtop the living room. That\\u2019s where the rest of the bedrooms are. So they work it out. All of them go to bed up there. Now the dream speeds up in time. I am looking after all of these kids by myself. I\\u2019m making their meals, we\\u2019re doing some kind of life skills activities during the day involving the garden and teaching them how to cook. There\\u2019s water that needs to be filled up in this complex system of rainwater catchment that\\u2019s heated by the fireplace and dispersed. Some of the girls are filtering the water and putting it in quart-sized containers for drinking water. It feels as though I have done this for about 10 days, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, how long is the dad\\u2019s night shifts?\\u201d I see him one morning. The kids are all happy to see him. Now there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference between the first group of kids and the ones that were clearly his. I say to him, \\u201cHow many more night shifts do you have?\\u201d He says, two. I say, \\u201cOh good. I was really hoping for some help here.\\u201d He has a bag of photography equipment in his hand and he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s picture day.\\u201d At this point I realize we need a backdrop. I\\u2019m tasked with going to the hardware store to get one. There\\u2019s a truck and I drive to the hardware store and get out. There\\u2019s this great big huge rack of backdrops. It\\u2019s like 8 feet long and 5 feet high. I choose one and am wondering how to get it out to the door without bending it. The employee appears to help me. She says she\\u2019s already rang it through. It doesn\\u2019t seem possible, but I take it out of the rack and it goes through the door and into the truck. It just fits. I get back to the farmhouse and take it out. Now I\\u2019m tacking it to the side of the house. Now there\\u2019s a piece of stucco ceiling. We\\u2019re outside. We\\u2019re getting ready to take pictures of the kids. He thinks the younger ones are going to be difficult, but they just come up and they\\u2019re happy. He says, \\u201cHow did you get them to do that together?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well we have this garden. I\\u2019ve got a garden in the back and we\\u2019ve been growing things. They really like it.\\u201d So the kids automatically go and get the herbs I showed them. They pick their favorites and bring them over. Then, click, click, click, the pictures are all taken and it\\u2019s really easy. Then the dad is finally next. It\\u2019s his turn. He\\u2019s lying on his back with his knees bent. I say, \\u201cOh just a second. I\\u2019ve got a kit for that in my car.\\u201d I go out and get it. They are small pieces of carpet I\\u2019ve cut out especially to cushion heads and sacrums. There are just two. I tell him to lift up his head and I put one under there. Then I tell him to lift his sacrum and I put one under there. Then I\\u2019ve got something different for the background. It\\u2019s made of some kind of fabric. I\\u2019ve got a tin of thumbtacks. I\\u2019m trying to push the thumbtacks into the wall. But just as I get to the end, the first one falls out. So he gets up and tacks it, only he uses the ceiling instead of the wall. I say, \\u201cOh, how did you do that?\\u201d He shows me the end of the tack. I see that it\\u2019s one of those things to replace Christmas ornaments - they come off and you can buy a package of separate ones. He has these in the tack instead and they fit into the ceiling. So I put one on mine and it goes into the ceiling like butter. I\\u2019m surprised. It works. Just as I\\u2019m about to turn around and go back to the camera, there he is behind me and there\\u2019s all this heat. I\\u2019m not going to go into detail, but we make beautiful love. Then all these other images go through my mind. It feels like in this whole dream sequence that he\\u2019s wanted me to fit in and I do, and now there\\u2019s all this sexual energy and love released from him and between us.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Working Vacation\\u201d I\\u2019m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I\\u2019m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I\\u2019m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn\\u2019t look like that now. There\\u2019s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It\\u2019s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it\\u2019s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They\\u2019re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that\\u2019s really sturdy. I don\\u2019t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it\\u2019s that big. It\\u2019s on its side and they\\u2019re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don\\u2019t really know what they\\u2019re building but they\\u2019re quite busy with it. They\\u2019re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they\\u2019re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they\\u2019re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It\\u2019s a mixed group of boys and girls and it\\u2019s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn\\u2019t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I\\u2019m not really sure what I\\u2019m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it\\u2019s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they\\u2019re doing and it doesn't look like they\\u2019re really doing anything except running around, I\\u2019m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don\\u2019t enter. There\\u2019s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don\\u2019t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn\\u2019t matter in the dream, so I\\u2019ll use the pronoun \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that\\u2019s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they\\u2019ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they\\u2019re exactly the same length and width. I think that\\u2019s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they\\u2019re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they\\u2019re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you want the other shoe?\\u201d The child doesn\\u2019t respond to me. I\\u2019m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I\\u2019m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn\\u2019t. I just wait around and all I\\u2019m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I\\u2019m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I\\u2019m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it\\u2019s a little darker than it is outside. There\\u2019s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It\\u2019s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We\\u2019re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I\\u2019m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She\\u2019s around 8. I notice that she doesn\\u2019t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We\\u2019ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we\\u2019re in a meadow now. We\\u2019re still walking and the sun sets and we\\u2019re in twilight. I wonder if we\\u2019re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don\\u2019t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can\\u2019t sleep. I\\u2019m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they\\u2019re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter\\u2019s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter\\u2019s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what\\u2019s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I\\u2019m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I\\u2019m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that\\u2019s strange. I\\u2019m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, \\u201cI think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.\\u201d She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don\\u2019t have a bathing suit so I\\u2019m just wearing something that won\\u2019t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we\\u2019d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn\\u2019t very big. Then I\\u2019m not sure how we\\u2019re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they\\u2019re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.\"],[\"\\u201cStress Dream\\u201d i\\u2019m working in a restaurant. I arrive and was supposed to have a uniform. When I was leaving the house, I made two rolls of clothing. One roll of clothing was the black pants, button down shirt and apron that I was supposed to wear for work. The other roll was my pajamas. When I get to work, I pull out my backpack and the pajamas roll is there instead of the work roll. I can\\u2019t leave. I don\\u2019t have enough time to go back and get my proper clothes and if I don\\u2019t work my shift, I\\u2019ll lose my job. So I\\u2019m forced to go out, feeling vulnerable, unprepared, and setting myself up for ridicule. I go out onto the floor in my pajamas with my apron on, hoping no one will notice. The manager does and I explain what happened. He sends me out onto the floor anyway. Instead of the section I thought I was supposed to have, I\\u2019m in another one that\\u2019s called the \\u201cBad Lot.\\u201d It\\u2019s called the \\u201cBad Lot\\u201d because no one wants to sit there until the restaurant is all full, and then it just gets slammed. Instead of the five tables that are supposed to be in the \\u201cBad Lot,\\u201d there are sixteen! They\\u2019re all over the place and they\\u2019re all seated at the same time. The pen won\\u2019t work. I can\\u2019t write down anyone\\u2019s orders. All the blank pieces of paper I had now have writing all over them. People are glaring at me; they\\u2019re yelling at me. When I go to take a drink order, no one can even make their mind up about what they want to drink. They say they\\u2019re ready but they\\u2019re actually not. So I\\u2019m standing there and it takes way longer than it should to take a drink order. There are people getting up and leaving. It's a total stress dream.\"],[\"\\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d This dream begins with me driving through the town I lived in with my biological mother. I\\u2019m making a circle around the downtown area. I\\u2019ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I\\u2019m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I\\u2019m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I\\u2019m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, \\u201cThere was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I\\u2019ve seen those exact roots.\\u201d When I\\u2019m saying \\u201croots\\u201d I\\u2019m picturing old brick at the bottom that I\\u2019ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn\\u2019t so. I just walk away because I know there\\u2019s no point arguing with somebody who doesn\\u2019t know anything and who\\u2019s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they\\u2019re hungry because we\\u2019ve been walking around and it\\u2019s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I\\u2019m making up something I call \\u201cSurvival Juice.\\u201d I\\u2019ve got these big glass carboys (jugs). I\\u2019m putting a lot of roots into them - some I chop first and some I just stuff down through the hole at the top. It\\u2019s a cloudy light beige color liquid. I simply describe it as \\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d - it\\u2019s a medicinal mixture I\\u2019ve made that is going to help us get through what we\\u2019re going through right now. I hand out a cup of it to each of my kids as well as the people at the restaurant.\"],[\"\\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go\\u201d / \\u201cDreams and Heartache\\u201d The setting in this dream is a campground where people would go with their RVs. There\\u2019s water and electricity on each camp, and huts where they have table tennis and ping pong, a nice shower, the washing machine and dryer and stuff like that. So I\\u2019m in the campground in an RV - it\\u2019s mine - and I\\u2019m sitting in a chair watching the sunset and this really good looking guy comes up and asks if he can join me. So I say yes and he sits down in the chair beside me. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and there\\u2019s some chemistry. He asks if he could see me again and if I would like to share dinner with him the next night and I say yes. So instantly it\\u2019s the next night and he\\u2019s brought dinner over. It\\u2019s a box of triscuit crackers. I can\\u2019t even eat wheat and in the dream I don\\u2019t ask if they\\u2019re gluten-free, but I look at what he\\u2019s brough and think, hmm this was not quite my idea of dinner. I excuse myself and say just a moment. I\\u2019ve gone back into my RV to get plates, knives and forks. I put a plate, knife and fork in front of each of us. He pours the crackers onto the plate and he pours two on each plate. I\\u2019m thinking to myself, wow, there isn\\u2019t even anything to go on top of the crackers. So he cuts his into 4 pieces, each cracker into 4 pieces. He asks me if I would like him to cut my food. He\\u2019s being chivalrous and galant about it. I accept his offer, but say I would like mine cut into 5 pieces please. I think this is funny because the triscuits won\\u2019t cut nicely into five pieces. They\\u2019re breaking and crumbling. He\\u2019s trying to cut mine into 5 pieces and I\\u2019m giggling under my breath. As he is struggling with this, I have a journal and pen in front of me. I\\u2019m writing a song called, \\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go.\\u201d It\\u2019s got song lyrics to rhyme and I think these are terribly clever. I\\u2019m using a tune to a popular rock song and am humming along as I do it. In the next part of the dream, the good looking guy is still struggling with the crackers. I walk across the RV park to the laundromat and I see my ex husband, Errant, and my son, and they\\u2019re talking to each other and preparing some food - now the laundromat also has a kitchen. I sit down in the chair waiting for them to finish what they\\u2019re doing. Errant sits down beside me, leans in and asks me what I dreamt about the night before. I start telling him - I get two sentences in and he gets up as if I wasn\\u2019t even saying anything and just walks off. He\\u2019s gone back to the kitchen. So I just sit in the chair feeling heartache. I get up out of my chair and walk into the kitchen where they are. Then my son asks me what I dreamt about and I start telling him. He would normally sit down and listen or exchange his own, and he does the exact same thing that Errant just did - listens for one sentence as though I didn\\u2019t say anything and leaves and goes upstairs. I sit back down in the chair feeling that I should not have exposed my son to Errant because he\\u2019s picking up his bad behaviors. I worry about that - how he will treat another partner in the future.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Accident\\u201d I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There\\u2019s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There\\u2019s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it\\u2019s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There\\u2019s an image of Ken. He\\u2019s raking or something - he\\u2019s doing something to the land. I feel like I\\u2019ve just finished doing what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There\\u2019s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There\\u2019s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. I\\u2019m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I\\u2019m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it\\u2019s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she\\u2019s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I\\u2019m starting to become aware of the room I\\u2019m in. I can\\u2019t move my body. I feel like I don\\u2019t remember what happened. I see Ken. He\\u2019s in the room. He says, \\u201cYou were in an accident.\\u201d He leaves. I\\u2019m in this room in the hospital. I don\\u2019t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can\\u2019t touch my face. Ken\\u2019s wife says to me: \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay.\\u201d I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can\\u2019t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo. Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.\\u201d The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re so far away I can\\u2019t identify them. I\\u2019m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, why shouldn\\u2019t I be doing this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, this is where you had that accident.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t say anything else. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m supposed to remember something or if I\\u2019m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can\\u2019t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I\\u2019m bobbing around and thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s funny. I don\\u2019t think I know how to swim.\\u201d Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the house. I\\u2019m in a bed. Ken\\u2019s wife is standing over me and says, \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThe water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?\\u201d I feel around my face with my fingers and there\\u2019s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, just rest.\\u201d She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, \\u201cI thought we weren\\u2019t supposed to tell her.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.\\u201d I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There\\u2019s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s about time somebody told me what really happened before.\\u201d This time Ken answers. He says, \\u201cOkay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.\\u201d Then, before I wake up, I\\u2019m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I\\u2019m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Airport\\u201d We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I\\u2019m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I\\u2019ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian\\u2019s house and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we\\u2019ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it\\u2019s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She\\u2019s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn\\u2019t hungry and it\\u2019s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she\\u2019s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she\\u2019s done this in a bowl before she\\u2019s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband\\u2019sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it\\u2019s like glue. Some of it\\u2019s hard and some is still soft. It\\u2019s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don\\u2019t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, \\u201ceww,\\u201d when I\\u2019m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She\\u2019s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, \\u201cWhat time did the tickets say we\\u2019re supposed to be there?\\u201d She says, \\u201c5 o\\u2019clock in the morning.\\u201d But she says it in metric first, but we don\\u2019t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, \\u201cAre you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o\\u2019clock.\\u201d So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o\\u2019clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it\\u2019s almost that time. He\\u2019s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he\\u2019s getting his clothes on and I\\u2019m putting things into the suitcase. We\\u2019re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, \\u201cNope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.\\u201d Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, \\u201cOh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I\\u2019ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We\\u2019ll still be there in lots of time.\\u201d Her husband says no, I don\\u2019t want you to do that. Besides, we\\u2019re just going into the US and you don\\u2019t need passports anymore.\\u201d But I tell them, \\u201cEvery time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.\\u201d He gets out a piece of paper that\\u2019s attached to the back of his driver\\u2019s license. He says, \\u201cHere, read the fine print.\\u201d I read down and it says it\\u2019s fine to go on with just a driver\\u2019s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver\\u2019s license with me. I say, \\u201cBut my son doesn\\u2019t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, \\u201cWell now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.\\u201d But he won\\u2019t let us go. He tells us all it\\u2019s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They\\u2019re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don\\u2019t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn\\u2019t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We\\u2019re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don\\u2019t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I\\u2019m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don\\u2019t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she\\u2019s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re over at Gate such and such.\\u201d So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they\\u2019ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that\\u2019s great, although I\\u2019m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don\\u2019t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arrangement\\u201d The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor\\u2019s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It\\u2019s some kind of reception, but I\\u2019m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don\\u2019t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he\\u2019s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he\\u2019s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I\\u2019ve earned it. I see in my mind\\u2019s eyes the word, \\u201cPlacement\\u201d on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I\\u2019m talking to them and realize I\\u2019m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It\\u2019s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There\\u2019s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It\\u2019s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It\\u2019s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he\\u2019s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I\\u2019m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I\\u2019m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I\\u2019m moving from one group to another making sure they\\u2019re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I\\u2019m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I\\u2019m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I\\u2019m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It\\u2019s hard for me to do this. I\\u2019m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It\\u2019s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There\\u2019s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I\\u2019m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don\\u2019t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll just sit with you.\\u201d This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There\\u2019s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It\\u2019s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it\\u2019s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I\\u2019m just now understanding this. So I\\u2019m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven\\u2019t had any time to get to know each other. I don\\u2019t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They\\u2019re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what\\u2019s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don\\u2019t. But my arranged husband does. There\\u2019s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we\\u2019re all in my arranged husband\\u2019s car and driving up towards his house. It\\u2019s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I\\u2019m responsible for making food. I\\u2019ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They\\u2019re working on a collaborative project. I\\u2019m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, \\u201cWell, is there anything else I can eat? I\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHere.\\u201d I say here, \\u201cYou can make the toast.\\u201d I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I\\u2019m feeling more at home. I\\u2019m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I\\u2019m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There\\u2019s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I\\u2019ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon. She says, \\u201cNo, all we have is on the racks.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve chosen this chapter book I thought he would like and see it. I tell him that\\u2019s not the book I wanted to get him and describe the stories in the book that I wanted to give him. This builds a little bit more of a bridge between us.\"],[\"\\u201cThe ATM\\u201d I\\u2019m in a lineup in the bank. My son is with me. I\\u2019ve got cash and gift cards to deposit. I\\u2019m twelfth in line and when I get to be second in line, I start to organize my piles of cash and gift cards. I realize that I cannot find my bank card, although I know it\\u2019s in my purse. So I\\u2019m disorganized and have too many things in my hands and there is too much stuff in my wallet that is not a bank card. As I\\u2019m trying to juggle all these different piles of things, I now become the first person in line and it\\u2019s my turn. I still can\\u2019t find my bank card. I say to the couple behind me - a man and a woman who appear to know each other and have been chatting happily the whole time - \\u201cI need to set my stuff down on the floor. I can\\u2019t find my bank card. I know it\\u2019s here. Feel free to go ahead.\\u201d They do and I can still hear them chatting happily with each other. I\\u2019ve spread everything out on the floor and sort through them. I\\u2019ve got envelopes opened with bills I\\u2019ve looked at and returned. There are things from my son\\u2019s birthday party. There are gift cards for McDonald\\u2019s that I know we\\u2019ll never use because we don\\u2019t eat there, but we can deposit them into our bank account. I finally locate my bank card. Every time I thought I located my bank card, I would look at it and it was a replica of a bank card but wasn\\u2019t a bank card. It keeps getting into the pile of things to deposit into the ATM by accident because it looks so much like a bank card but it\\u2019s not one. Although when I\\u2019m finally read to make my deposit, the couple that was chatting happily has gone and there are different people who are ready to have their turn. I walk up with my son and say to the person who\\u2019s next: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been looking for my bank card and have already been waiting in this line. Is it okay if I go next?\\u201d They\\u2019re quite happy to let me go. I get there and the screen is like an electronic game board - like \\u201cSnakes and Ladders\\u201d or \\u201cGame of Life\\u201d or \\u201cMouse Trap\\u201d or one of those really colorful game boards for kids with lights and red, green and yellow. I try to put my bank card in and realize it\\u2019s this dummy bank card again. I pull it out and am trying to sift through. I have different deposits in between each finger and thumb as if my hand is a categorized sorter. I know I\\u2019m taking a really long time. The bank machine spits out the pseudo bank card. I ask my son if he\\u2019ll hold a couple things. I\\u2019m still trying to get the bank card. I turn around and explain to the person behind me: \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. The machine keeps rejecting my card.\\u201d Then, I locate the real bank card and put it in. Now it\\u2019s asking me to select from one of the buttons underneath if I want to deposit gift cards. The button is really tiny. There are three buttons you can press and they\\u2019re all really close together. I keep trying to push the one button. Finally it works. Every time you push a button, a whole bunch of other things light up on this screen. There are pictures of circus people and they aren\\u2019t just pictures, they\\u2019re animated parts that are moving. I get the gift card thing to work and insert them one at a time. On the screen, which is quite large - probably 12x12 - it\\u2019s like a record of your deposits and says exactly what you deposited and how much the gift card was worth. So I\\u2019m feeding four gift cards in. Then it tells me what bills I need to pay. I had the bills all organized. You have to push each bill into the machine to pay your bills. I think I\\u2019m almost done when the bank teller comes out with three big boxes of past records of bill payments. I\\u2019m unprepared to deal with all of this. I finish my transaction and allow the ATM to return my card so someone else can have their turn. I thank the person behind me for waiting patiently. Then I look at what's in these boxes. It is my whole life, everywhere I\\u2019ve lived, as if the bank has kept records of this and it\\u2019s all in the boxes and sorted sequentially in years and months in a proper sorting job. All of these envelopes have been opened with transaction receipts that are on letterhead folded in threes and put back in the envelope and sorted chronologically. It goes all the way back through every relationship I\\u2019ve ever had prior to my daughter\\u2019s birth with all the different houses I\\u2019ve lived in, everywhere I\\u2019ve traveled. I think that I\\u2019ve taken care of this. I\\u2019ve paid my taxes. I didn\\u2019t even know there were records that this stuff existed. I decide to just shred them and not even attempt to go through all these boxes and take everything out to look at it. I\\u2019m done with that. I\\u2019m good. I pick the boxes up. I walk around the giant line of people waiting for the ATM. I notice the material of the floors and walls. I notice the architecture of the building. Everything is made of marble. Feet click on the marble. It\\u2019s very ostentatious, yet it is quite simple. I guess it\\u2019s like an expensive institution style architecture without a lot of external trappings; it\\u2019s all straight and linear, boxed. The ceiling, however, is really high. I\\u2019m standing at the teller waiting to say that these things need to be shredded. I see the woman who was part of the couple chatting happily. She\\u2019s telling one of the tellers that now there is a hot studio on the top floor of this building. She\\u2019s pretty happy about this and she\\u2019s going to go up there and try it. I think to myself, \\u201cWow, that seems odd that there would be a hot yoga studio on the twelfth floor of a bank institution.\\u201d I watch her go upstairs. She\\u2019s dressed really colorfully. She\\u2019s wearing a tan mini skirt and bright pink jacket that almost meets the hem of the mini skirt. I watch her walk up the stairs. The teller takes my boxes. I say, \\u201cPlease just shred these.\\u201d Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Attacks\\u201d My dream last night was a nightmare. It starts in the town where I grew up. I\\u2019m in front of the house that I lived in when I was growing up. I\\u2019m sitting on the grass in the front lawn and I see a person but it\\u2019s not clearly identified features. I\\u2019m just somehow in my dream saying it\\u2019s a man. The man is running and shouting angrily. I feel threatened so I start to back up. The person runs into my neighbor\\u2019s house on the right. I can\\u2019t go in my own house because I'm not safe there so I sneak around the side of my house and am hiding in the backyard. I hear screaming and yelling and commotion. The man comes out of my neighbor\\u2019s house and starts coming back up towards my house and goes in - nothing happens because no one\\u2019s in there - and comes out. I realize that he is sneaking or stalking around the perimeter of my own house. So I avoid him but he\\u2019s not far behind and I don\\u2019t know where to go that\\u2019s safe. I notice that my other neighbor\\u2019s side door is open a little bit and I\\u2019m feeling kind of bad about going into the house without knocking, but if I don\\u2019t run in and close the door and lock it, then that thing will get me. So I run in, close the door and lock it and the lady that owns the house looks at me and says, \\u201cOh! What are you doing in here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cQuick! Lock the front door! There\\u2019s an angry person!\\u201d (but I don\\u2019t call it that in the dream. I\\u2019ve given it a name and the name escapes me). I warn her, so she does and we listen and it\\u2019s yelling angrily and pounding at the door and trying to get in, but it doesn\\u2019t. But while it\\u2019s trying, I tell her that it\\u2019s been chasing me for ages and I\\u2019m really sorry for invading your privacy, but I needed to come in here or it would kill me. She says that\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s alright. She calmly looks at me and says, \\u201cFreya, what have you been doing? I never see you anymore.\\u201d So she\\u2019s talking to me and she\\u2019s kind of oblivious that this thing is out there. And then our small talk finishes. It\\u2019s quiet. It\\u2019s been quiet. I hover by the inside of her side door, waiting and waiting. I finally decide to open the door a crack, take a peek out, look around, there\\u2019s nothing. So I decide to leave and I go out of her house. I start walking up the street. Just as I get part way up, there it is again! It\\u2019s chasing me again, so I\\u2019m running and I can feel my breath getting caught in my throat and I\\u2019m getting out of breath and my legs start to hurt but I keep running and running and running. All of a sudden, that town turns into the town where I currently live. I\\u2019m coming towards the main street and I don\\u2019t know where to go because it\\u2019s dark out, nothing\\u2019s open, I don\\u2019t know anyone there. Then I realize that my friend lives about a block away and I might be able to make it to his house. So I do. This thing is behind me! I can hear it and it\\u2019s like just almost within a grasp of me the whole time. I make it to my friend\\u2019s apartment building and again I\\u2019m feeling the same kind of thing as I did in my neighbor\\u2019s house where I don\\u2019t feel right about barging in without knocking or without asking if it\\u2019s okay to come over or any of those things you do before you go over to someone else\\u2019s house. His door is slightly ajar and I run in, close the door and do up all the locks. I\\u2019m standing there and I can hear this thing on the outside, and it\\u2019s like snuffling around almost animal-like. I can feel its fingers tracing the outline of the door, looking for some way to come in. I back away really really slowly. I see my friend lying on the couch in his living room. He\\u2019s resigin. He\\u2019s having a nap. So I quietly sneak down into one of the bedrooms. I sit there. Some time passes and I\\u2019m listening for this thing and now I can hear it outside the apartment building trying to find a different way in. I don\\u2019t look out the window because I\\u2019m afraid it will see me. And then my friend wakes up and he\\u2019s over by the bedroom door, and I\\u2019m like shh with my finger over my mouth. I indicate to go to the middle of the apartment. The kitchen is actually in the middle. We go over there and I tell him, \\u201cI hope you don\\u2019t mind me coming in. There\\u2019s this thing chasing me and everywhere I go, it manages to break in the door or smash a window.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d So he tells me to just make myself comfortable and I do. He, my friend, goes about his regular tasks. He\\u2019s putting his things in his case and collecting up textbooks and he\\u2019s packing his lunch. He gets dressed and I\\u2019m still sitting there waiting and waiting. I\\u2019m nervous that he\\u2019s going to open the door and that thing will get in and find me. But he tells me to lock the door behind him, he opens the door, there\\u2019s nothing there. He goes to work and then I lock the doors behind him. So now I\\u2019m sitting in his apartment. I don\\u2019t have any of my own stuff. There\\u2019s not really anything to do. So I go in and wash the dishes because there\\u2019s nothing else to do. Then I\\u2019m sitting in the living room staring at the walls, feeling slightly trapped. I\\u2019m not calm. I can feel how tense and wired my body is. Then I sense that there\\u2019s somebody in one of the back bedrooms. So I go in there and my daughter\\u2019s in there and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! You\\u2019re here!\\u201d Then I notice that my cats have appeared - they are in the apartment too. I go into the other room and there\\u2019s my son. So now everybody\\u2019s in here and they\\u2019re safe. Okay, this is a good thing. Now, what are we going to do about food and clothing. I go over to one of the dressars and suddenly there\\u2019s clothing for us in one of the dressars. I go out to the kitchen and there\\u2019s no shortage of food - why would there be, somebody lives there. So I prepare my kids something to eat. I\\u2019m warning them, though, not to make too much noise or turn on many lights because that thing might get us. Then the day passes. We have some idle chit chat, patting the cats, and just kind of mindlessly arranging the furniture so we\\u2019ll fit in there - just slightly small. And then my friend comes back home from work and he\\u2019s just in there. I don\\u2019t actually see him come in the door, so there\\u2019s no fear about the door - that\\u2019s not revisited. He\\u2019s just in there again and I still feel tense that now we\\u2019re wearing different clothes and we\\u2019ve made food and now my cats and my kids are in there. And I\\u2019m scared because this is a huge invasion of his privacy. I don\\u2019t know where his dog went - he actually has a dog that would be some concern with the cats, but the dog doesn\\u2019t seem to be there. He\\u2019s a single dad and his two kids - the one son just comes and goes freely and the daughter is two weeks on, two weeks off. So I'm tense about this and he says, no that\\u2019s fine, don\\u2019t worry about it, and he says, come here, and he gives me a big hug and says, lie down. And he\\u2019s just hugging me. I can feel myself start to relax. I feel the tension slide away from my body. I accept that I\\u2019m safe. It happens gradually - as this hug is happening, a day passes and a night passes and a day passes and a night passes, and then I accept that okay, this is the right place to hide and it\\u2019s okay. My daughter has started to come and go freely. My son hasn\\u2019t. My friend\\u2019s kids are in their own routine and they get along fine. My son has taken an interest in his daughter - she is unique - and my son is very nurturing. The two of them have formed some kind of bond and that doesn\\u2019t surprise me because my son loves younger kids. So some semblance of normalcy has formed in my environment. I still want to go home, but I know I can\\u2019t and for now, this is working fine and people are happy.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Barge\\u201d A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It\\u2019s quite intricate and detailed. I\\u2019m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don\\u2019t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we\\u2019re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I\\u2019ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I\\u2019m just standing there. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m at a really large lake or an ocean. I\\u2019m just watching. I\\u2019m looking at the water. You can\\u2019t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It\\u2019s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It\\u2019s also very balmy and a bit windy. I\\u2019m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It\\u2019s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They\\u2019re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I\\u2019m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I\\u2019m being told that it\\u2019s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it\\u2019s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we\\u2019re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I\\u2019m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I\\u2019m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don\\u2019t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I\\u2019ve been with before. I don\\u2019t try to join them because they\\u2019re in a family grouping. There\\u2019s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don\\u2019t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I\\u2019ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what\\u2019s there. There are muffins. But I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re gluten-free and I know I can\\u2019t eat wheat, so I don\\u2019t get them. There\\u2019s something else on the table. I\\u2019m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she\\u2019s too short and can\\u2019t reach it. I\\u2019m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, \\u201cMy mom said I can have one.\\u201d So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, \\u201cJust a minute, let\\u2019s find your parents.\\u201d She points further up the pier and says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re over there.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t see anybody. She\\u2019s fairly determined and tugging me. We\\u2019re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It\\u2019s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, \\u201cOh look! It\\u2019s garbage day.\\u201d So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It\\u2019s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I\\u2019m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there\\u2019s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it\\u2019s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that\\u2019s on the pier. I think. \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d The post is still standing. I think that\\u2019s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, \\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they\\u2019re supposed to be here. He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see anyone.\\u201d I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there\\u2019s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they\\u2019ve all been in this trauma but she\\u2019s not going to go because she\\u2019s not ready. Now I\\u2019m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I\\u2019m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I\\u2019ve got my laptop with me and I don\\u2019t want to take it. I say to her, \\u201cIs it okay if I leave this in your room?\\u201d She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I\\u2019m getting into a Jeep. It\\u2019s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they\\u2019re all cut out for open air. So I\\u2019m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it\\u2019s cleared out and doesn\\u2019t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There\\u2019s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they\\u2019re with. I don\\u2019t have a \\u201cwhoever I\\u2019m with\\u201d so I don\\u2019t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. You can\\u2019t see the sun overhead, though. There\\u2019s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It\\u2019s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don\\u2019t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven\\u2019t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don\\u2019t know what time we\\u2019re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don\\u2019t see any. At one point the day feels like it\\u2019s gone on. I am hungry but I don\\u2019t have any food. I\\u2019m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren\\u2019t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I\\u2019m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I\\u2019m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they\\u2019re having together and they don\\u2019t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I\\u2019m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I\\u2019m looking for staff to help me. I\\u2019m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I\\u2019m going to miss supper as well. I\\u2019ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bathroom\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house this time. It\\u2019s a turn of the century home. It\\u2019s a fairly big brick house. Everything on the inside is made of wood - the floors, railings and banisters. There is wainscotting on the walls and crown molding. It has that lovely creaking sound everywhere where your feet walk. The house creaks. The doors creak. When you walk up and down the stairs, the stairs creak. It\\u2019s also built in a square. So, the stairs would go up one side of the house and down the other side, so that there can be a wood stove or something in the middle that heats the upper floor bedrooms at night when people are sleeping or even when the weather is cold. My room is on the second floor. One wall would be the windows looking to the outside, and opposite that would be the door that goes into the hallway. The hallway has a banister on one side that goes around in a square around the middle. So the hallway is actually quite a long tall domed ceiling and then the side that has the doors into everybody\\u2019s bedrooms. It feels like a square. There are at least two bedrooms on each side, so that makes it an eight bedroom house upstairs. It feels really, really big and I think it\\u2019s even bigger than that. There\\u2019s more than one bathroom. The fact that I have my own ensuite, my bedroom is also really big. This is my dream setting. I am in my bedroom and I\\u2019m aware that my daughter and her boyfriend have gone into my own ensuite bathroom because I can hear their voices. It sounds like one of them is in the shower and the other is just doing something in the bathroom. So they\\u2019re having a conversation. I realize it\\u2019s my daughter in the shower. She\\u2019s getting ready to go to work and her boyfriend is going to drive her. He\\u2019s doing most of the talking. I can hear sounds of her getting ready. As I look towards the bathroom, I see that there\\u2019s beading on the wall that my bedroom shares with the ensuite - the door to which is closed, obviously. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, the shower water is leaking through the walls somehow.\\u201d Then I go around where the beading is. The part of the wall where the ensuite is is curved inwards towards my room. So I go around to the other side of the curve and I notice that the beading is getting more prolific and it\\u2019s brown, like tobacco color. Then my eyes follow up from the beading to the ceiling, and I see that the ceiling is buckled down a little bit. It\\u2019s a really high ceiling - probably about 12 feet high. I follow that all the way across the ceiling with my eyes towards the window. I can tell there are a whole bunch of watermarks, so this must have been going on for a really long time. Then when I look back to the curved part of my own wall, I can see that the beading has all turned black and it\\u2019s black mold. Then I turn back and look at the window. I see that that trajectory of water is also starting to turn into that tobacco color. Then I turn my head again and look back towards the shared wall of the bathroom and the material that the wall is made out of is starting to fall off the wall and around onto that one side to the left, there is a giant piece that has fallen off. I can see the shower curtain. It\\u2019s an old fashioned ball and claw bathtub with a track along the ceiling and the shower curtain. My daughter is like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that doing open when I\\u2019m having a shower?!\\u201d She\\u2019s shocked. Then both of them - she and her boyfriend - leave out the other door of the ensuite and enter my bedroom. She\\u2019s wrapped in a towel and asking what\\u2019s going on. I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. The bathroom is falling apart. The mold is eating it.\\u201d Then we\\u2019re trying to figure out who to call and I realize I don\\u2019t know who owns the house. Then I have this book that\\u2019s a registry of ownership. I\\u2019m going backwards in a reverse chronology through time of who owned the house. I realize that all these people are dead. I communicate this to them and tell them I still haven\\u2019t figured out who to call. Now she\\u2019s dressed and getting ready to leave for work, but as I look up to the ceiling, some of the ceiling is starting to fall down. I\\u2019m telling them to go get buckets to put underneath the parts where most of the water seems to be channeling to and dripping. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWho do I know that can come and help fix this? Who do I know that also has a house around this age that might have some wisdom?\\u201d I think of someone with last name Landon, who used to be the landlord of a house I lived in a long time ago. I find his phone number and call him. He arrives at the front door and one of the kids lets him in. He comes upstairs. He\\u2019s got a ladder and we put it in the room and climb up the ladder. As soon as I touch the ceiling, the whole thing buckles and comes down. I realize it\\u2019s a ceiling underneath a ceiling. Above the ceiling is an attic. There\\u2019s a secret staircase on the other side that I didn\\u2019t know was above me. The ceiling that I thought was my bedroom ceiling has crumbled and my room is completely unusable - it\\u2019s disintegrated. I\\u2019m climbing up the ladder trying to access the little staircase that has been exposed. Somehow I manage to do it. I reach for the bottom stair of the new staircase and climb up those creaky wooden stairs. There\\u2019s a wooden door at the top. I turn the doorknob and enter. It\\u2019s a really long attic. You can smell that musty sawdusty wood smell. But it smells dry - it\\u2019s not moist like the moldy smell of what has disintegrated below me. Then I see Omar. He\\u2019s sitting in there. He doesn\\u2019t say anything, though. I\\u2019m looking around the attic trying to locate or hunt for or unearth any signs of who has lived here before. I\\u2019m wondering why it was deliberately covered up. Unfortunately at this point, a noise in the real world wakes me up. I want to return to this dream.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Board Meeting\\u201d In this dream, I am in a townhouse complex. It opens and I\\u2019m having a day to myself where I realize I can do whatever I want. I\\u2019ve decided I\\u2019m just going to play my guitar. I get my guitar out and am setting it up. I see out my window that my stepmother is leaving. Through the window, although I can\\u2019t hear her voice, she tells me that she\\u2019s told the board of directors that I\\u2019m going to take her place for the day and be the secretary and record her notes. I\\u2019m annoyed and then she\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t even have time to tell her this is my only day to myself and I didn\\u2019t even agree to this. Now instead of having the day, the board of directors is filing into my house. I notice that they\\u2019re the seniors from the day at the whaling place when they were just there as onlookers at this whaling equipment and remarking over it. This also annoys me. The meeting starts and they\\u2019re talking about things. As I\\u2019m recording this, I\\u2019m noticing that no one is really sharing the conversation. No decision is being made. They\\u2019re just talking about everything. They move from one thing to another and it\\u2019s taking an extraordinary long period of time and it\\u2019s unproductive. I start doodling on my page and not really recording anything. Then they get to a conversation where someone has brought up that they smell marijuana in the complex. I think to myself, \\u201cWell, of course you do. It\\u2019s legal in Canada now.\\u201dThey\\u2019re talking about the smell. They don\\u2019t like walking through smells. I think to myself, \\u201cyeah, I\\u2019ve smelled it for about half a second when I\\u2019ve been in a canoe on the water and no one else is around. I\\u2019ve smelled it for another half a second when I\\u2019m walking on a sidewalk to the grocery store.\\u201d So the clouds of smoke from somebody\\u2019s house half a mile away have drifted around like other smells do from the kitchen and people\\u2019s bathrooms. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much longer are they going to go on talking about the smell and they can\\u2019t even do anything about it. This meeting is unproductive.\\u201d So I set down the pad of paper I\\u2019m writing on and I wander off to a different area of the room. I actually get my guitar out again and wonder if they can hear me. I start tuning it very quietly and no one says anything. Then I start playing a song. Then I hear on the agenda that they\\u2019re talking about someone who has asked for a refund of $26.57 for something the board processed that they shouldn\\u2019t have. I think, \\u201cOh, that was me! That was years and years ago. I\\u2019d forgotten about that.\\u201d So I set my guitar down and go back to the table. I\\u2019m listening to the process of their conversation and wondering if they just talk about this at every meeting for three years and never get it off their list? I wonder if they\\u2019re going to get it off their list this time. I don\\u2019t even care about it now and it\\u2019s a small amount. I\\u2019d forgotten about what it was for and as I\\u2019m listening to the conversation, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh yeah, they shouldn\\u2019t have charged me for that. So one of the men that was on the whaling excursion, he's sayinsaucerg that she\\u2019s right and they should reimburse her the money. He doesn\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s me. Someone else from the board says, \\u201cWell, where will the money come from?\\u201d I mentally roll my eyes and think, \\u201cGeez, they don\\u2019t even have a treasurer.\\u201d Then someone else says, \\u201cWe need to put in a request for that.\\u201d Then I just wander away from the table again, thinking, \\u201cWow, they will never get anything done. Maybe they\\u2019re just here because there\\u2019s nothing else for them to do.\\u201d I go back to my guitar.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bubble Gum Pipe\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room and people I used to work with at a restaurant while at university are gathered in this room. They\\u2019re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They\\u2019re there, too. At first I don\\u2019t notice them because they\\u2019re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we\\u2019re in this other place. They have a baby. I\\u2019m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we\\u2019re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I\\u2019m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I\\u2019m watching the skaters. I\\u2019m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She\\u2019s got a platter in her hands. It\\u2019s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She\\u2019s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It\\u2019s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she\\u2019s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I\\u2019m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don\\u2019t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don\\u2019t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: \\u201cFreya, get over here. I\\u2019ve got one for you.\\u201d So I start to walk closer to her. But I\\u2019m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it\\u2019s warm and there\\u2019s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI heat it up with taffy first.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don\\u2019t want it in my mouth. She says, \\u201cCome on. You\\u2019re coming with us.\\u201d I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, \\u201cMy dad, I need to let him know where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. He\\u2019ll be okay for a bit.\\u201d I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go see my mom and dad.\\u201d We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We\\u2019re almost at her parents\\u2019 place. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He\\u2019s going to be worried about me.\\u201d I look down and say, \\u201cOh we don\\u2019t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can\\u2019t even call him.\\u201d She says to me, \\u201cYour dad was crying when I saw him. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d Then I get more distraught. She says, \\u201cHe knows where my parents live. He\\u2019ll know where to come get you.\\u201d I think that he won\\u2019t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, \\u201cHow did we get all the way over here?!\\u201d Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman\\u2019s house. I think, \\u201cHow is this truck even making it down the side because it\\u2019s so steep?\\u201d It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I\\u2019m not going to get to my dad in time. He\\u2019s going to be gone by the time I get there because this is taking so very long. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bus Trip\\u201d I\\u2019m on a tour bus, a coach bus that they charter for tours across the country. I\\u2019m with Natalie, one of the owners of the Yoga Studio where I work and two little girls, maybe about ages four and six, somewhere in there. The kids are a lot younger so I\\u2019m assuming that they're two of her four kids, but maybe not. The bus stops and we all get out. There\\u2019s a baseball game going on in a field. The baseball diamond is at the back of a building. I\\u2019m not sure what\\u2019s going on in the building. It\\u2019s almost like a school meet and greet, it has that kind of feel to it. Natalie and the two girls go off and join up with the meet and greet. I\\u2019m more interested in the baseball. Because I\\u2019m not a regular player, they put me in the outfield, which is fine. I\\u2019m standing there, the way you would in the outfield, waiting for something to happen out there. I start to listen to the dialogue between the other outfielders. I notice that they\\u2019re mocking a woman. The mockery is to do with women is like, \\u201cYeah right, they\\u2019re not good for baseball that\\u2019s for sure.\\u201d Then the men all laugh. I suddenly think, \\u201cAre they talking about me?\\u201d I notice that there are about ten outfielders and one or two other women while the others are men. At first I\\u2019m offended by this. I feel a little bit of umbrage start to rise up because I\\u2019m actually really good at baseball. They don't know this. I notice that although they\\u2019re mocking, they\\u2019re also smiling as though they also appreciate the fact that the women have some skills. It\\u2019s a strange mix of regard and disregard. As I\\u2019m noticing this, I'm also noticing their clothing. It looks like the kind of clothing that men in the fifties would wear. I suddenly notice they all have fifties style clothing with the vest overtop of the short sleeved shirt. I realize as I look at the women's clothing and the umpire wearing this heavy leather vest instead of the sleek light-weight material it\\u2019s made of now that it is the fifties. This is how me in the fifties probably talked about women as co-ed games just began to rise in acceptability. I\\u2019m gladI restrained myself and didn\\u2019t say anything because I don\\u2019t want to stand out and show that I\\u2019m from a different time period. The baseball game ensues. I do catch a couple baseballs and throw them to the appropriate pitch. I get a couple of hands across the back, guy\\u2019s style way to go slaps. The baseball game ends. I see Natalie and the two girls walking across the field towards me and we get back on the bus. The next stop is a big long building that\\u2019s a flea market. The tour guide stands up and says, \\u201cOkay, you\\u2019ve got enough time for five cubbies or booths and two something elses.\\u201d So we get off the bus and we know we have to hurry because there are only a hundred and we can only pick five and then two. We have to make sure it\\u2019s the ones we want. I don\\u2019t really care about anything that\\u2019s there. I let Natalie do the selection and I think that will keep the girls occupied because they\\u2019re starting to get a little bit restless. One of the ones we go into is a freestyle jumping area with skipping ropes and things to climb through. They are made of a different material and there are no electronics. I\\u2019m wondering what time period this is from. One of the others is a playhouse. It\\u2019s so sexist. The girls are playing and they\\u2019re sweeping and pretending to wash dishes. I\\u2019m quickly losing interest in this and looking around to see what else I might be interested in. I go over to ask Natalie what time it is on her phone. We both have cell phones, but nobody else has this kind of equipment. The girls are already finished. We have a little extra time that we\\u2019re starting to bank. The next thing we see is a big long room with racks and racks of clothing. Interestingly, they\\u2019re sorted into colors and not sizes. I\\u2019m really liking this. Natalie says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s bring the girls through here because it\\u2019s so vast that just walking through will burn off some of their energy. I say, \\u201cGreat because there\\u2019s some stuff I\\u2019d like to look at here.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that if I can look closely enough at the clothing, I can figure out what decade this is. But what happens is that the girls run through and we\\u2019re burning through it and we\\u2019ll be done ahead of time and I\\u2019m not getting time to look at the clothes. I tell her that I want to go back and look at two different colors of clothing, although there's actually three when I think about it. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you back at the door when it\\u2019s time for us to get back on the bus.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s only five minutes from now.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019ll work quickly.\\u201d I go back and I\\u2019m looking through the brown clothing. I think this is from the sixties. I\\u2019m picturing myself wearing this brown dress with the waist line just under the breasts and the full flowy skirt. I think I can do my eye makeup like the sixties and put my hair back like the sixties. I really want this dress. But there are only two sizes and one is obviously too small and there\\u2019s no way my boobs will fit in it, and the other one is giant. I\\u2019m disappointed because I really wanted one. I go over to the indigo rack. I don\\u2019t like anything I see there, it\\u2019s all ugly. There\\u2019s another rack of really light peach and a cashmere shirt with no sleeves and a little tiny soft loose turtleneck. I really want this shirt - it would be so soft and I could wear the peach color on my lips and still wear my hair and eye makeup in the sixties style. But there\\u2019s not enough time for me to buy it! I run back to the door and Natalie is standing there with the two kids. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cThe bus driver is looking for you!\\u201d I get on the bus and am disappointed and thinking about that shirt and then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cake\\u201d I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I tell him that sure, I\\u2019ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn\\u2019t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it\\u2019s run by a temperamental chef. There\\u2019s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I\\u2019m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they\\u2019re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they\\u2019re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they\\u2019re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I\\u2019m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I\\u2019m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there\\u2019s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there\\u2019s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover\\u2019s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She\\u2019s about 10. And she\\u2019s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn\\u2019t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she\\u2019s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn\\u2019t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn\\u2019t upset about it. He\\u2019s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he\\u2019s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn\\u2019t address the cake. Now we\\u2019re in a car and we\\u2019re driving up this beautiful roadway - it\\u2019s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there\\u2019s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in when you\\u2019re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It\\u2019s a perfect day and there\\u2019s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it\\u2019s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cash\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town and I\\u2019m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They\\u2019re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I\\u2019m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it\\u2019s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there\\u2019s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they\\u2019re not making any sound, so I\\u2019m suspecting that it\\u2019s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don\\u2019t have that much money yet. I\\u2019m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don\\u2019t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I\\u2019m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I\\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table. They\\u2019ve wandered off now and I\\u2019m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I\\u2019m sensing another presence there that I can\\u2019t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what\\u2019s wrong with my car. He\\u2019s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic\\u2019s and I tell them exactly what\\u2019s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don\\u2019t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I\\u2019ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, \\u201cYay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.\\u201d And they\\u2019re saying, \\u201cOh wow, that\\u2019s fantastic.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn\\u2019t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.\\u201d So I\\u2019m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I\\u2019m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar\\u2019s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he\\u2019s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I\\u2019ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, \\u201cOh, what was wrong with it?\\u201d And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I\\u2019m cautious as Mike asks me what\\u2019s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, \\u201cOh? How did you know to say that?\\u201d because he knows even though I\\u2019m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don\\u2019t know the exact language to call the parts. And he\\u2019s looking at me. And I\\u2019m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I\\u2019m thinking is that I don\\u2019t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he\\u2019s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we\\u2019re in shifts and changes and we\\u2019re sitting in his mom\\u2019s actual house on the couch in the living room. There\\u2019s a picture of Omar on the end table. I\\u2019ve got my one arm around the back of Mike\\u2019s shoulders soothing him. I\\u2019m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, \\u201cOmar told you, didn\\u2019t he?\\u201d and I said, \\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d And then I say to him: \\u201care you okay?\\u201d And he puts his head down and it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom\\u2019s house are gone. We\\u2019re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we\\u2019re in it. Omar\\u2019s at the wheel and he\\u2019s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He\\u2019s tapping the gas pedal and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201chmm well this is good.\\u201d I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, \\u201cyeah and look how much cash I\\u2019ve got left over.\\u201d He laughs. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that extra cash?\\u201d And I know what I\\u2019m going to do with it, but I haven\\u2019t told anyone. So we\\u2019re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it\\u2019s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we\\u2019re driving down Colburn for a block and now it\\u2019s the year it would be now. I\\u2019m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an ice cream store over there. That\\u2019s new. There\\u2019s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there\\u2019s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn\\u2019t changed.\\u201d Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing? Now we\\u2019re back on Kent St.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.\\u201d He looks at me and we\\u2019re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I\\u2019ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing here?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I\\u2019ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.\\u201d I give it to him and I say, \\u201cGo buy a guitar. Just do it!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d So we go into the store and we\\u2019re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, \\u201cOh what one are you interested in?\\u201d Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, \\u201cWell, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn\\u2019t have the pickup and it\\u2019s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.\\u201d So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.\\u201d (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYes!\\u201d And he says, \\u201cDone!\\u201d So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they\\u2019re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that\\u2019s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there\\u2019s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There\\u2019s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There\\u2019s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it\\u2019s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he\\u2019s doing. It looks like he\\u2019s making chocolate chip cookies. He\\u2019s got the dough rolled out and there\\u2019s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, \\u201cWhat the hell?!\\u201d I walk up and I\\u2019m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they\\u2019re not even chocolate chips. They\\u2019re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I\\u2019m thinking, oh my god, that\\u2019s gross, but I\\u2019m fascinated that he\\u2019s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: \\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\\u201d and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they\\u2019ve already gone out of that room and I know they\\u2019re going down a hall and there\\u2019s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There\\u2019s no tools in front of him and no table. He\\u2019s faking working. I realize that he\\u2019s eavesdropping, he\\u2019s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my dream?! You\\u2019ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.\\u201d He starts telling me that he\\u2019s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It\\u2019s bullshit what he\\u2019s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don\\u2019t want to lose them and I certainly don\\u2019t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it\\u2019s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He\\u2019s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like \\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, \\u201cThis is Errant, my ex-husband.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cThis is Omar.\\u201d As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar\\u2019s hand, I realize that there\\u2019s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant\\u2019s going to be mad about this and he\\u2019s going to pound it out into me because he\\u2019s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I\\u2019m like I can\\u2019t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don\\u2019t want that handshake to join. Errant says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad,\\u201d as though he knows Omar\\u2019s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, \\u201cFor fucks sake! He knows that and he\\u2019s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He\\u2019s inserting himself here and of course, Omar\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh thanks very much.\\u201d He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, \\u201cOh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.\\u201d I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I\\u2019m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there\\u2019s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I\\u2019m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he\\u2019s a jerk, don\\u2019t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I\\u2019m still so agitated I can\\u2019t calm myself down in the dream. I\\u2019m feeling both threatened that Errant\\u2019s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I\\u2019m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I\\u2019m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won\\u2019t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I\\u2019m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Coffee Pot\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It\\u2019s snowing out. There\\u2019s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it\\u2019s still snowing. There\\u2019s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there\\u2019s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don\\u2019t. The house is brick. It\\u2019s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it\\u2019s taller than it is wide. It\\u2019s old. I can tell it\\u2019s old because the glass isn\\u2019t flattened by a machine, it\\u2019s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I\\u2019m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It\\u2019s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say \\u2018it likes\\u201d because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It\\u2019s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it\\u2019s mostly black. It looks like it\\u2019s made of cast iron but it\\u2019s not because it\\u2019s light when you pick it up. I think it\\u2019s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It\\u2019s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There\\u2019s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It\\u2019s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I\\u2019ll sometimes look for it. I\\u2019ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it\\u2019s going to disappear and come back again. This day it\\u2019s missing. I have a roommate. She\\u2019s more like a neighbor but she\\u2019s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I\\u2019m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I\\u2019ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I\\u2019m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, \\u201cHave you seen the coffee pot?\\u201d She continues to look at me but doesn\\u2019t nod her head yes or no. I say, \\u201cJust in case you\\u2019re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you\\u2019re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?\\u201d She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I\\u2019m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It\\u2019s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it\\u2019s happy. When it\\u2019s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it\\u2019s been. It\\u2019s like every time it comes back it\\u2019s a little bit different. Sometimes it\\u2019s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It\\u2019s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it\\u2019s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cold Water\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large ranch style log house. There is a lot of iron made stuff and stuff made out of wood. There are really old fashioned cooking implements nailed to the wall. There are farming pieces and sides all made of iron and hand-hammered - you can see the little pound marks and everything. It stretches from the eating area through what would be the kitchen area into a longer gathering place where there are other rooms that are dark - I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s in them but I think they are bedrooms. I\\u2019m standing in that area. I\\u2019ve walked in through the front door, through the parlor, through the kitchen area, and now I\\u2019m standing in the back parlor. Other people are there and in my dream I know them but I don\\u2019t recognize them with my conscious mind to give them a name now. They\\u2019re dressing in various kinds of wetsuits. They have diving equipment and masks. Some of the wetsuits are the short ones, some are longer in the leg. The idea is to go out snorkeling or diving into the stream that runs on the property behind the ranch house. I feel like I\\u2019m ready to go and I\\u2019m confident. So, I walk out and it\\u2019s winter. There\\u2019s snow on the ground. I walk out the door along the snow, along the bank of the river, until I get to the point where it\\u2019s been decided that I will enter. Everyone is entering at a different place. I start to climb down a river bank that\\u2019s probably about four feet high. I\\u2019m backing down on my stomach. Where my feet are supposed to hit solid ground, they don\\u2019t. It breaks from underneath the weight of my body, but there\\u2019s so much of my body already over the embankment that I can\\u2019t pull myself back up and I just slip down into the freezing icy cold water. I\\u2019m trying to shout for help. I can feel my limbs starting to freeze. But nothing comes out of my throat. I keep trying to shout louder but my voice won\\u2019t obey my emotion. I\\u2019m trying to say help and I\\u2019m trying to say I\\u2019m cold, but nothing comes out. I can see people around me but they aren\\u2019t noticing that I\\u2019ve broken through the surface and I\\u2019m sinking.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Creek\\u201d I\\u2019m in a forest and it\\u2019s winter. There are various people out in the forest as opposed to being in the squat stone building that maybe people live in. it has the atmosphere of danger and some kind of threat. I feel like people have been fighting recently. There\\u2019s a woman and she has sleepy eyes and a drink in her hand. I think she\\u2019s drunk. She\\u2019s wearing a long cloak and has some small beads that she\\u2019s wearing on her forehead. She\\u2019s older. There are bodies lying around, too, I can see them. They\\u2019re knights and their armor has been smashed and dented. I\\u2019m also wearing a long gown covered with a cloak. I don\\u2019t feel cold, but I know I would be if I weren\\u2019t wearing so many clothes. I\\u2019m waiting for people and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving to go somewhere. I see one of the people I\\u2019ve been waiting for, a younger woman and she\\u2019s garbed the same way we are. I can see through the evening a low stone building. It looks like there is a big stone wall around the building. It\\u2019s like a low big building with a defense wall around it. We\\u2019re waiting for one more person before we take off. We have to go across the creek and through the other side because it will be safer that way. The creek is frozen over. As I\\u2019m standing there, I\\u2019m watching an animal go across. I can\\u2019t quite see what kind of animal because it\\u2019s dark and I\\u2019m trying to figure out what they are. On the other side, I see a bigger roundish black animal and a very small one that\\u2019s maybe the size of a dog or a cat. As my eyes start to focus in on them and get used to the dark, I realize the small one is a baby bear. The woman beside me says out loud or telepathically that she has to go get that bear because it\\u2019s her spirit animal. So she starts to slide down the bank, taking small steps and sliding on her bum a bit. Everyone is quite respectful and nervous of the creek because we don\\u2019t know if we can break through or not. But she wants to get the baby bear because it\\u2019s part of the journey. The other animal is not the mama bear; I think it\\u2019s a teenage bear. The baby is struggling. Its legs are too short to navigate the land. The younger woman starts across the creek. She asks, \\u201cWhere did it go? I don\\u2019t see where it went.\\u201d I\\u2019m scanning the area with my eyes. I see another body, also female, at the side of the bank. She looks dead. The little bear has stumbled across towards her over the snow banks and frozen water that was heaved up over to the side. It looks like it\\u2019s trying to rouse her, licking her face and pawing at her. She doesn\\u2019t stir and I really think she\\u2019s dead. As the other woman stands up and walks across the creek, she\\u2019s about half way across and I see close to the shore I\\u2019m standing on, a hand reaching up from the ice. The hand has long thin fingers and reminds me of a sloth\\u2019s hands. I know it\\u2019s not human. It looks familiar but I don't quite know what it is. The baby bear stops trying to rouse the dead woman and has begun making its way towards the younger woman that was going to get it. It\\u2019s moving the way a puppy wags its whole body in happiness about being picked up or given attention. She does get the bear and pick it up. Now we have everything. There\\u2019s a woman behind me - the woman that looks drunk -, me and the one that has the small bear. We start to make our way across the creek. Then the dream blips out. We\\u2019ve made it across and there is less snow so the walking is easier. We\\u2019re going away from the small castle with the defense wall around it. We\\u2019re moving through the forest.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Curio Shop\\u201d My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I\\u2019m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It\\u2019s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can\\u2019t even see what\\u2019s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don\\u2019t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We\\u2019re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They\\u2019re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we\\u2019ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It\\u2019s purple, but it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s blue. It\\u2019s got fur all over. The fur doesn\\u2019t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there\\u2019s this creature in the store and my son\\u2019s got him. I don\\u2019t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they\\u2019re half off, they\\u2019re still really expensive and I don\\u2019t think I need a spoon that badly. I don\\u2019t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I\\u2019m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s this one.\\u201d I still think it\\u2019s expensive and say I don\\u2019t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my son?\\u201d One of the male shopkeepers says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to follow me.\\u201d So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d and it just bursts out of my body. I\\u2019m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it\\u2019s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I\\u2019m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that\\u2019s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, \\u201cNo way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!\\u201d So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, \\u201cRun! We have to get out of here!\\u201d So we start running. I don\\u2019t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We\\u2019re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can\\u2019t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s go in there. There are other people.\\u201d The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, \\u201cLet\\u2019s change our clothes, \\u201c so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He\\u2019s right there. I tell him, \\u201cYour partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can\\u2019t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.\\u201d He\\u2019s not helpful. In fact, he\\u2019s in league with the other one. So now we\\u2019re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can\\u2019t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got my son! You\\u2019re holding him and I want him back.\\u201d Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, \\u201cFine fine, okay!\\u201d He writes this phone number down. I say, \\u201cA phone number?! Are you kidding me?!\\u201d I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I\\u2019ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I\\u2019m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It\\u2019s a 10-digit number. Now I\\u2019ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It\\u2019s like 164576476470, like that. The 4\\u2019s and 7\\u2019s won\\u2019t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I\\u2019m sobbing and saying, \\u201cJust tell me where he is. Just go get him.\\u201d One of them says he\\u2019s in the basement. \\u201cThe basement of this building?!\\u201d I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m trying to get back into the dream, but I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Disc, the Irish and the Owl\\u201d This dream I think I am in some kind of consciousness of one of my best friend\\u2019s from high school. I\\u2019ll call her Ellie. She died of cancer in her thirties in real life. The dream setting is I\\u2019m in outer space on a big round disc. It\\u2019s flat and shiny on one side and rough and rocky - the rocks are black with granules in them, like sand, that seem to be picking up a little bit of stellar light. There are lines on top of the disc that radiate out from the center towards the periphery. In the center are a few people. As I get closer to the disc, I\\u2019m standing on it in one of the radii. There\\u2019s my friend, Ellie. She takes me around the disc and I seem to gelan that there are twelve of these radii. Each one goes towards the periphery and there\\u2019s a door on the periphery. I go into some of the doors and see people. The first one I go in is a washroom. There\\u2019s various people in there and they\\u2019re trying to get something sticky off their hands. I feel a little confused as to why I\\u2019m in here - I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to discover or look for. So because it\\u2019s a washroom, I go into one of the stalls and decide to sit down on the toilet and see if I can urinate. I do. Then I take some toilet paper. It\\u2019s sticky! So, I wipe myself, but then it won\\u2019t immediately leave my fingers and go into the toilet. So I get another piece. I try to wash the first piece off my fingers, but it too is sticky. I rub my fingers together to try and get it off, put it into the toilet and it does. It disintegrates a little, but there are still pieces on my fingers. I dress and go to wash my hands. I notice that there\\u2019s little bits of shit all over everything. Now I don\\u2019t want to touch the taps because I think that will get on my fingers. I can start to smell it now and it\\u2019s disgusting. I just want to leave that area. I think there are little bits of shit on my leg and the back of my jeans and on my arms and clothing. Just little tiny pieces. I can\\u2019t find anywhere to wash that\\u2019s also not covered with shit. I come out of the bathroom and look at Ellie. Then I look down at myself and it\\u2019s all cleaned. So I wonder why she\\u2019s taking me through these experiences. She sends me down to what would be the 6 o\\u2019clock position. We had been standing at 12 and this washroom was about at 2 o\\u2019clock. There are people in some kind of friction, perhaps arguing. I don't get involved with that. Instead of going all the way around the clock, I come back up the same side I went down towards her. Without saying anything, I communicate to her that I\\u2019m really not enjoying this experience. She says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go back to my house for dinner.\\u201d She\\u2019s from a large Irish family with 6 kids. We appear in her house. A few of the kids have a friend, so there are a large number of people in the kitchen. There were four boys in that family, two of them were twins and then herself and her sister. The twin boys each have a friend over and there\\u2019s one extra friend. The older two boys are in the den watching tv. I look at the friends and think that they\\u2019ve been smoking. The mom puts the meat on a plate and puts it on the table. I think to myself that there\\u2019s not enough for the number of people that are there, but I\\u2019m not very hungry anyway. So I don\\u2019t take my plate and line up to get food. The boys and their friends do. They take almost all of it and there\\u2019s just Ellie, her sister and me and the two parents who haven\\u2019t eaten yet. They tell me to take my plate and go get some. So I take the saucer from underneath the tea cup, so it\\u2019s a very small plate and I just put a little bit of meat on it, a tiny bit of potato and some gravy. Then I turn around and there\\u2019s this whole other plate of meat. So I say, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t see that.\\u201d They say, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s okay, here, take another piece.\\u201d Somebody puts another forkful on my plate. So we eat. Then the boys and their friends go back outside for a little while to run off some of their energy. I go into the sisters\\u2019 room and see that it used to be the pantry because there\\u2019s not very much room to walk around the bunk bed. Somehow or other, Ellie\\u2019s sister has managed to sit in this little tiny space and she\\u2019s playing with some plastic toys that are lined up on the floor. She seems to be happy. I go back out. Now I feel like I have somehow become Ellie because she is gone and I\\u2019m just there and her family is treating me as though I am her. I go out into the kitchen, clean up the rest of the dishes. Then I check on the boys - I go into the den. The mama is in there as well and someone comes to the door and she knocks on it and asks the mom for some help. The mom lets her in and offers her some food. The woman accepts the offer, takes some and asks the mom if she will take out her stitches. So the mom gets some first aid things, gets her food, takes out her stitches, wraps the food up for her, sends her away out the door. As the woman is leaving, she says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you again in the morning.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow this family gives so much to other people.\\u201d Then I leave the den, go back out into the kitchen and the boys come home. I look at them and their eyes are red. I think they\\u2019ve been smoking and I wonder why no one else seems to comment on them. But one of the twins looks guilty and puts his head down and doesn\\u2019t meet his mother\\u2019s eyes when he walks by her. Now it\\u2019s nighttime. Everybody is getting ready for bed. The whole family is home. I go into my room. I see an owl. It\\u2019s looking in the window at me. I realize it\\u2019s a pink owl - that\\u2019s the name of the species. I like a cigarette and smoke it. So, now I\\u2019m confused. I realize that Ellie smoked in high school, so I must be her. I lie in bed, watching into the night and I see the owl fly off towards some celestial body in the sky. Then it becomes morning. I haven\\u2019t slept. I just stayed in my bed. I only had one cigarette, but the room is smoky. I get up in the morning and instantly the bedroom changes into an eating area again. There\\u2019s all kinds of extra people in it - everybody has an extra friend. There are extra adults who have come with the parents and there\\u2019s food on the table. The meal is shared around again and it seems to keep growing from the plate. Even though it doesn\\u2019t look like there\\u2019s enough food to satisfy everyone, there seems to be enough. Then the food is cleared away and the dishes are brought into the kitchen to be washed. When I\\u2019m out in the kitchen, the final scene I notice is one girl that was very nasty. Her name was Lynn. She\\u2019s also sitting in the middle of the kitchen. I remember she was a person who tried to insert herself into the friendship that I had with Ellie, but it didn\\u2019t really work. There were no ties or anything in common. She\\u2019s sitting there and no one is talking to her. I just walk by her, noticing her presence, but don\\u2019t speak with her. She is not nice. I don\\u2019t look at her and don\\u2019t want to interact. I continue washing dishes and then wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Domo\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to teach my class and there\\u2019s so much noise that I can\\u2019t even hear the sound of my own voice. I\\u2019m not sure what building I\\u2019m in, it\\u2019s got a sloped ceiling but the ceiling is also really high and there\\u2019s a little bit of slope to the floor. It\\u2019s almost like a lecture theatre, except there are no chairs. It\\u2019s supposed to have really good acoustics but it doesn\\u2019t because there\\u2019s so much background noise, but it\\u2019s not the students in the class that are talking, it\\u2019s students in the hallway and crowds of people outside. I can hear construction, jack hammers and buzz saws. It\\u2019s a cacophony of sound and so loud that I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m speaking or not. I can\\u2019t start my class. I go to the hallway, open the doorway and ask the people out there waiting to go into another class if they could please be quiet because they\\u2019re so loud. As I\\u2019m saying this, I realize there\\u2019s not supposed to be any talking in the building. So they say they will be quiet. I go back into my class. As soon as I start teaching, I can hear them again. They\\u2019re playing sports in the hallway, yelling and cheering. I can\\u2019t start. Then I\\u2019m sitting off to the side, I still have to sit there for the full hour, but I\\u2019m not teaching because I can\\u2019t. I see my brother. He\\u2019s not in the class, but he\\u2019s wandered up from the construction sight where people are building something. He\\u2019s taking a break. We talk for a few minutes. I feel really good to see him in my heart, I feel comforted by his presence. Then, it\\u2019s quieter. It stays quiet. I say I\\u2019m going to start trying to teach my class again. I ask him: \\u201cWill you stay?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t practice yoga, but he says, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll try it this time.\\u201d There he is. I move my mat from the middle of the class up to the front as though I\\u2019m a participant. This way I can be beside my brother. My voice, because of the design of the acoustics, it doesn\\u2019t matter that I\\u2019m not facing my class because the voice is supposed to carry anyways. So I start teaching and it\\u2019s so nice and quiet. I get through the sun salutations and a few other postures, then all the horrible noises start again. I try to teach a little bit more but I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I do a few more things just continuing on, hoping the class can see me and just follow along. This works for about five minutes, then the whole cohesiveness disintegrates so I stop. By this time the hour I was supposed to be in there was over and I\\u2019m free to go. I ask my brother, \\u201cEven though it was only a part class, what do you think? You looked like you were doing everything just fine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, you know it is a good class. But I\\u2019m not going to start doing it every day.\\u201d I laugh because I know he wouldn\\u2019t do that anyway. He goes back to the construction area and I go out the opposite door of where the students are going into the noisy hallway. I exit out of the building but it\\u2019s not really a hallway, everything turns into glass. There\\u2019s a glass vestibule and a door to the outside which is a docked area with a walkway and piers but I don\\u2019t see any ships. It\\u2019s good to be out in the sunlight and air. I see the husband and two kids of the two studio owners I work for. I walk towards them. I\\u2019m supposed to meet them because we\\u2019re all waiting for her. While we\\u2019re waiting, one of her kids is squatting down on the dock and looking into a hole in it. I\\u2019m curious at what they\\u2019re doing, they\\u2019re trying to pull out a bug. I walk over closer and actually see that he\\u2019s pulled out one already and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I wonder what kind of bug it is. I squat down closer to see and I\\u2019m just watching, I haven\\u2019t said anything to him. He has some kind of tweezers and is trying to pull out another bug and he\\u2019s working away at it for a few minutes. Then he says to me, \\u201cCan you see it down there?\\u201d I get a flashlight out from the back of my cell phone and am shining it around in the hole. I can see something but I don\\u2019t know what it is. Then he says to me, \\u201cHere,\\u201d and he hands me the tweezers. \\u201cCan you try?\\u201d So I get down a little closer on my belly. I can see something down there now. I want to be careful I don\\u2019t injure it. I put the tweezers around it gently and start to pull a little bit. Then I take it out. I have it just behind it\\u2019s skull, around its neck. I set it on the dock. It\\u2019s just sitting there, kind of like it\\u2019s stunned, probably because of the light. It was quite dark down in the hole. It\\u2019s got a very very very dark green body and a gold head. It has a band of gold at the top of its tail and the rest of its tail is green, a greenish black. I say, \\u201cOh what is this?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t have scales, it has the body of a beetle, but without the hard shell on the top so it\\u2019s soft. It\\u2019s tail is reptilian. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a domo.\\u201d I say, \\u201dHmm, I\\u2019ve never heard of that.\\u201d We look at it a little bit more. It has really beautiful black eyes and it looks like there\\u2019s a soul in them. Probably it\\u2019s three inches long. I say, \\u201cOkay?\\u201d He says yes. Then I put it back in the hole. The other things that he\\u2019s pulled out look like dead bugs, probably that the domo has fed from. I just use the side of my hand to brush them back into the hole. I give the son back his tweezers. We stand up. The daughter says something to me but I can\\u2019t recall now what it was. We move off to the side away from the dock. We\\u2019re still waiting for their mom to come. We sit. I don\\u2019t know how we got inside the building but we are. We\\u2019re in a different part of the building. The kids are playing together and I\\u2019m sitting down. The husband comes over and starts talking to me about something. Then he says, \\u201cJust a sec, close your eyes.\\u201d As soon as I close my eyes, I feel this big particle start to fall on my eye and face. He blows on my face. I feel it move along my eyelashes. Then he says, \\u201cOh are you upset that I did that?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking it was a little bit weird having his breath so close to my face. I don't think he meant anything intimate by it. I think he was just having a dad reflex, like when you say hold still and blow to interrupt a thing that was going to fall in your kid\\u2019s eyes. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But then I look at the thing and it\\u2019s like a big giant salt crystal, probably a quarter inch by quarter inch like a triangle cube. Now they\\u2019re falling all over the place. There\\u2019s a bed that\\u2019s not mine and somebody is supposed to be lying in it. These salt crystals are all over it. I look and there is a handheld vacuum off to the side. I say, \\u201cHey I\\u2019m going to use this and see if I can get these things off the bed before they fall all the way down to the bottom.\\u201d I turn the vacuum on and suck up these things. But there are so many of them that they are spilling out of the vacuum as quickly as they\\u2019re coming in. I dump these things out of the vacuum. I open the vacuum up, clean it all out, put the vacuum together and turn it on. I put my hand over the nozzle and feel that it has good suction. I go back to the bed and try to suck these into the vacuum. I pull the mattress away from the side of the bed so I can get in there. I do this a few times. Now I realize that I do need to sleep here. I don\\u2019t want to lie on these hard crystalline things. I\\u2019m trying to get them off the bed. I\\u2019m fiddling with this and trying to clean it. Then I see that the studio owner, the kids\\u2019 mom, is back. Something completes. I don\\u2019t have to wait anymore. I\\u2019ve done what I\\u2019m supposed to do and can check out now.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Ex\\u2019s Whiskey Bottles\\u201d I\\u2019m in an apartment. I\\u2019ve just moved there. I'm surrounded by all these things, almost three-quarters of them are my ex-husband\\u2019s. I don\\u2019t notice this until I\\u2019ve hired two people to come help me clean because I can\\u2019t get it all done. One woman makes a comment that she can\\u2019t clean around all this stuff. She asks me if I can move it. I apologize and say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m trying to go through all this.\\u201d Then I ask her what stuff she\\u2019s talking about. I look at it and the stuff she\\u2019s talking about is gold whiskey decanters. They\\u2019re all different kinds and shapes and they\\u2019re valuable and they\\u2019re all empty. People have given them to us. I never filled them because I don\\u2019t drink whiskey. I didn't throw them away because they were gifts. Some of them I haven\\u2019t even looked in. So she\\u2019s indicating them. I pick them up. These ones are squares - six squares made of gold with rings on the top that you pull on and the decanter slides up out of the square gold carrying case. That\\u2019s when I notice they\\u2019re empty. Then I realize that he\\u2019s taken some of them, but only the ones that had whiskey in them. So I think, \\u201dWhat am I going to do with all these?\\u201d Then I open the door and in the hallway, some sales rep from a whiskey company has set up a display of different kinds of whiskey. I think, \\u201cHmmm, I wonder if I can just set all the decanters up there when they\\u2019re not looking and they'll just think it\\u2019s part of the display.\\u201d So, now I\\u2019m busy with that. I\\u2019m opening the door, peeking out into the hallway, and waiting for all the people to leave so I can do this.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Family\\u201d In my dream I am always with this family - it\\u2019s a large family, there\\u2019s like 7 kids in it. I\\u2019m always over at their house, although I\\u2019m not a biological part of their family, but I\\u2019m there because I just love them and they don\\u2019t just tolerate me, they make me feel like part of their family. I\\u2019m not adopted. I do at times go home, but in my dream I don\\u2019t see anything of my own home, I just know that I do go there sometimes. The dream starts where we\\u2019re doing various different activities. There are some scenes where I\\u2019m in the downstairs bedroom which has three single beds in it and most of the kids seem to go down there to hang out. So some of the older boys are having their own conversation in one part of the room and I\\u2019m talking with the four youngest ones. One of them is my age, the other one is only a couple years younger and there\\u2019s another one about two years younger and an even younger one. So we just hang out, play games, talk. Sometimes the scene changes and we\\u2019re outside and we\\u2019re doing outdoor things or down by the lake - beachball, swimming, splashing around, stuff like that. It\\u2019s like the dream is establishing a long line of family activities. There\\u2019s even some that\\u2019s just meal time. And movies. So, this goes on until one day I\\u2019m again sitting in the downstairs bedroom that has the three beds in it, and one of the youngest two boys is now between the ages of 12-14 - it\\u2019s not specific in the dream, he\\u2019s not a boy but he\\u2019s not a man, so he\\u2019s a younger teenager. All of a sudden, he throws me on the bed, hikes my skirts up over my head and puts his mouth right on my clitoris, and then starts massaging it with his tongue. I\\u2019m in shock. I don\\u2019t react for maybe two seconds. And then I\\u2019m like: \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d At the same time that he does this, one of the other kids stands in front of the bed and opens up a giant sweater that becomes like a billboard, so the older kids don\\u2019t see this. I realize at the same time that this happened, this other sibling knew about it ahead of time and was helping. Anyway, that happens at the same time that I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d And I\\u2019m saying \\u201cStop it!\\u201d and he does. And then he goes into the bathroom which was a room - it\\u2019s like an ensuite large bedroom type of thing. There are so many kids in that family that they share a bathroom in the basement, another one on the main floor and another one on the top floor. I\\u2019m just sitting on the edge of the bed, and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat the fuck? I didn\\u2019t see that coming.\\u201d And then I realize, oh maybe I did see it coming, I was just oblivious, because he\\u2019s always hanging around with us - my friend and I. Maybe he had a crush on me. Now I\\u2019m starting to feel like I\\u2019m partially responsible for that happening. So I start to feel bad. I start to feel guilty. So after a few minutes pass and I collect myself, and no one else noticed (the billboard sweater blocked the other three), so there\\u2019s still a fair amount of activity still going on in the room that was still going on when it happened and was still going on before that. So in a way, it kind of allows me to calm down because nothing else has changed, although that for me has changed. I feel like unless I sort this out, I won\\u2019t be able to come to this house anymore with this family I\\u2019ve come to love so much and is part of my sanctuary. So I go in the bathroom thinking I\\u2019m going to find some kind of wounded boy, and I\\u2019m going to see if he\\u2019s okay and I\\u2019m thinking we\\u2019re gonna have to have a conversation about this. And he\\u2019s doing something else. One of the younger siblings is in there having a bath. And I\\u2019m like, okay, so I go over to the cabinet. I\\u2019m getting things out for the younger kid\\u2019s bath, like soap and a towel and washcloth and setting them on the edge of the bathtub. And I notice that there\\u2019s a jar of alcohol in there, and I\\u2019m like: \\u201cWhose is this?\\u201d And I find out that it\\u2019s that boy\\u2019s - the tweenager - that molested me. And the younger one in the bathtub has also been sipping away at it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere did you get this?\\u201d Well, they stole it from their parents. But it\\u2019s like in a mason jar, an empty mayonnaise jar that has been cleaned out with the lid on it and stuffed in there between stacks of washcloths and cotton balls and toothpaste and stuff. So nobody notices - I guess with a house full of seven kids you don\\u2019t keep track of everything. So I put the lid on it and say, \\u201cYou guys shouldn\\u2019t be having this.\\u201d And then I close the shower curtain so the younger kid is in there having a bath, and he\\u2019s not that young - he\\u2019s like 10. And I talk to the other one. But just as I\\u2019m about to talk to him, I realize oh my god, he knew exactly what he was doing. He\\u2019s done this before. And I never even thought of him as old enough to have been having sex. And what\\u2019s all going through my mind at the same time is this - there\\u2019s been times when he\\u2019s not been participating in stuff with the rest of the family. So instead of having a talk with him because I\\u2019m worried about him, I\\u2019m feeling guilty, I feel like I\\u2019ve also appeased him. So instead of having a talk from that angle, I\\u2019m like: \\u201cHave you had a girlfriend before?\\u201d And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cyeah I\\u2019ve had one for two years.\\u201d First it was so and so, and then it was somebody else. And he starts telling me that he thinks I\\u2019m amazing and he wants to go out with me. It\\u2019s not just a crush, the things he\\u2019s saying to me sounds like a mature man. It\\u2019s just that he looks a lot younger, and I never thought of him like that. And part of me realizes that because I\\u2019ve known him since he was young, I still treat him like a baby and think that he\\u2019s younger than he actually is. So in the dream, I realize that I\\u2019ve underestimated him but I\\u2019m still not comfortable because I\\u2019m enough older than he is that I don\\u2019t feel comfortable even though he\\u2019s technically old enough to have a relationship and has already had two. Then I tell him this: \\u201cLook I really care about you and think of you as a sibling. I\\u2019m not comfortable with this. I\\u2019m too old.\\u201d Then he seems okay with this, so I go upstairs because I don\\u2019t want to stay in the basement anymore. I still haven\\u2019t resolved my own feelings about feeling violated. And the scene shifts. So now one of the kids in the family that\\u2019s always a bit younger, I start to look at her, and I wonder about her features. I\\u2019ve always thought that she was a girl, but just not very feminine looking. And she always kept her hair short. And I always wondered why no one ever made her wash her hair. Her hair was always dirty and it was parted at the side like an awkward side - way over past a normal side part, like an old man comb over. And again I always wondered why did no one ever tell her to fix her hair? And she\\u2019s always worn these very baggy shaped overalls. As I look closely at her face - she has acne - I wonder what she would look like without the acne. None of the other kids have acne - they\\u2019re all really clean. I look at her features and I think she does look like the other kids - you can see the family resemblance. But yet, there\\u2019s something really different about her, and I realize I\\u2019m looking at androgyny. So now for the rest of the dream, I refer to her as them or they. And now whatever happened to the one that was around my age, that kid is gone. I\\u2019m now closest in age to \\u201cthem\\u201d - that child has no name in the dream. We start doing some things together. Although I realize that their mom loves them, I guess because there are so many kids in the family, she also doesn\\u2019t notice a lot of things that they actually do. I start to feel like a mom and I start to mother them a little bit. I don\\u2019t ask them about their hair. But I start trying to get to know them a little bit better - just asking them what they like to do and things. And they start to confide in me and they share that they don\\u2019t have a sexual identity - they don\\u2019t identify either as male or female. In fact as I get to know them a little better, I see both male and female, so beautifully intertwined in this being who has never been criticized or singled out for their preferences, so they\\u2019ve just been allowed to wear what they wanted to wear, and wear their hair the way they wanted to have their hair. Then on their sixteenth birthday, an envelope comes in the mail addressed to them, and they\\u2019re really excited as they open it. It\\u2019s a letter from the army! I say, \\u201cWow! I didn\\u2019t realize that you had any interest in joining the Army. What about this interests you?\\u201d And they say it\\u2019s about the beautiful uniforms and they start to describe the fabric and the shape of them and how they outline the strength of the shoulders - they taper down to here. They want to be an officer - not the infantry, the foot soldiers who fight, but an officer and organize this and be part of the structure. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Feedback Centre\\u201d In this dream I am in a conference center, but it\\u2019s not like a square room with a whole bunch of chairs lined up in rows and then there\\u2019s a raised stage with a podium or anything like that. It\\u2019s more like where you would go see a movie because there\\u2019s one wall where you take a number and you sit in some chairs like when you go get your driver\\u2019s license. So you\\u2019re sitting there and there\\u2019s a whole bunch of different windows. And you wait there until your number\\u2019s called and you go up to one window and receive your feedback. Then you\\u2019re allowed to take your feedback to tables that are set up more like round tables, some are rectangular and long though, they are different shapes. You can order food and you can meet people, you can talk to other people. It\\u2019s full of people. The atmosphere is very loud - it\\u2019s almost like there\\u2019s music going on, like satellite music being pumped in. There\\u2019s no point where anything is silent. It\\u2019s busy. It\\u2019s moving fast. There\\u2019s a service staff there that\\u2019s bringing people food and alcohol. And I\\u2019m finding that it\\u2019s overwhelming. I\\u2019m overstimulated. I don\\u2019t really want to be there anyway. I took a bus to get there. I left my peaceful quiet home to get on this bus to go get feedback which I\\u2019m a little excited to see, but I\\u2019m also dreading some because with feedback there\\u2019s always some that seems to be laced with people\\u2019s jealousies, base emotions. People that give feedback don\\u2019t really understand what the program was. As well as positive feedback. So it\\u2019s with mixed emotions that arrive at this place, the Feedback Centre, to receive my feedback. It\\u2019s not clear on what program I\\u2019m teaching or participating in. Some of the feedback is just on conversations that you\\u2019ve had with people or things that you\\u2019ve said. So it\\u2019s vast and at the same time really specific. So I line up. I\\u2019ve got my number in my hand and wait until I\\u2019m called. I\\u2019m chatting with other people - just mindless talk, it\\u2019s small talk. I receive my feedback. I\\u2019ve got it in my hands and there\\u2019s a whole bunch of different papers. It\\u2019s like the things people would fold up and put in a feedback box, so when you empty the box out, there\\u2019s all these small folded up pieces of paper. I have them in my hand. I\\u2019m looking around to see if there\\u2019s anyone I know at these tables so I can sit down and sort through this and I do. I see a group of friends that I know (I know them in real life as well) - they used to be my neighbors and I still see them, sometimes we go out dancing together. So I go and sit with them. Some of them have already ordered food. Some of them have already ordered a drink. I realize that they are not even there to get feedback. They\\u2019re there to just participate in a dinner out together, so they\\u2019re celebrating someone\\u2019s birthday. But that\\u2019s okay. They see me and they wave, \\u201cHey Freya\\u201d and I go sit with them. I start looking through my feedback. One of them asks me if I\\u2019m going to get something to eat or drink. I say no, I\\u2019m going to be going soon. I\\u2019m sorting through my feedback pile, opening up all the papers, flattening them out, setting them in a pile. A server comes over and asks me if I\\u2018m going to get anything. What am I going to order, she says. I tell her I\\u2019m not going to stay very long. She says, \\u201cWell you have to order something in order to sit at this table.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cOkay then please feel free to set a menu down here.\\u201d So I start looking through the feedback and in my dream I\\u2019m not reading any of it. It\\u2019s like the words aren\\u2019t even in English, they're just like blah blah blah, until I get to one that says, \\u201cYour feedback is too ripe.\\u201d And the \\u201ctoo ripe\\u201d is in quotation marks. And I think, \\u201cMy feedback? What have I even given feedback on?\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to scroll through my mind and think what I\\u2019ve done in the last year where I\\u2019m providing feedback to others. And I see it\\u2019s signed by Oake, and I realize it\\u2019s Oake from my Priestess School. So while I\\u2019m sitting there thinking what she could mean by that and what does too ripe mean, the server comes by and I order a salad and a cider. She goes away. And then one of the neighbors starts talking to me and she\\u2019s describing her vacation and asking me if I\\u2019m going to go on one. She says she\\u2019s single and would I come on one with her and I\\u2019ll be her roommate. She starts describing its attributes and stuff, so I\\u2019m a little distracted from my feedback pile but I\\u2019m enjoying the conversation and actually considering going on the vacation with her. So I leave my pile of feedback notes and she grabs me by the hand and takes me over to this other table. They have brochures for sunny vacations and she\\u2019s all excited and animated about it and she\\u2019s telling me some of the ones she\\u2019s been to or where she wants to go. Suddenly there\\u2019s a portal in that table and it opens up and we\\u2019re at a pool. I\\u2019m in a bathing suit. So is she. We dive down into the swimming pool and swim more than a couple of lengths - enough swimming so that I look at her and say, \\u201cOkay i can\\u2019t swim anymore!\\u201d And she says, \\u201cAlright let\\u2019s get out.\\u201d So we get out and dry ourselves off. We put our towels around our waist and go up and look. There\\u2019s a freezer full of M&M\\u2019s food - it\\u2019s premade food you can order, all in cardboard boxes - they have stores with just a sea of cardboard boxes of premade food. It\\u2019s disgusting and I don\\u2019t want any. She\\u2019s pulling out all different kinds of boxes and getting really excited about her purchases and by this time I really don\\u2019t want to participate in that. I\\u2019m trying to think of how to get out of it politely without offending her. So I just tell her I\\u2019ll carry her boxes for her and I do. Here we are in bare feet now with towels wrapped around our waists, in bathing suits, walking up a street and getting on a bus, going to her house, dropping them off. She stays there and now I\\u2019m standing there and I feel slightly out of place and uncomfortable in my bathing suit with no shoes on. I can feel the grit of the road and the sidewalk and the dirt from the floor of the bus. I get back on there with my towel wrapped around my waist, go back to the Feedback Centre, walk in and now I don\\u2019t know where my actual clothes are because they\\u2019re in this portal from the table with the vacation brochures. I go back to my table. My friends are now eating dessert. My salad and cider seem to have disappeared. I pick up my feedback stacks and I look at them and I feel some kind of umbrage that after all of the stuff that I\\u2019ve done for Oake for her school to help her that her feedback for me is that mine is too ripe. As I sit with this, I realize that I have given feedback to her school that she took and was appreciative of it at the time and actually followed through on some of it and it improved her situation. And I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, and now you\\u2019re telling me in this not directly to my face way that it\\u2019s too ripe.\\u201d I realize that she means it\\u2019s too blunt, it\\u2019s too straightforward, she wants it to be softer and padded with flowery poetic language and stuff so that it doesn\\u2019t cut through to the chaste so well. The last part of the dream is the person who is celebrating the birthday that all these neighbors are there for, I realize I don\\u2019t have a gift and everybody else has given him something. I feel obligated to do so, so I go out to the parking lot and my daughter or my nephew is there and I tell him/her this and they give me a bag of caramel corn to give to this guy and a birthday bag to put it in. So I go walking back in with the bag of caramel corn. I find him. I\\u2019m feeling kind of ashamed of the gift because he\\u2019s getting purchased things and gadgets and stuff. I walk over and give him the bag and say, \\u201cKiss on a cheek. Happy Birthday. Sorry, I didn\\u2019t realize it was your birthday when I came here.\\u201d He takes the gift and says thank you. I turn around and walk away, take my feedback things from the table, deposit them in the used bin, so it checks off my name that I\\u2019ve had it. I turn around and see that he\\u2019s put all the gadgety gifts and everybody is excitedly digging into the bag of caramel corn. So instead of being a 3x6 inch one, it\\u2019s now this giant back of carmel corn and they\\u2019re all like,\\u201d Woohoo! Caramel Corn! This is the best gift ever.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Flying Machine\\u201d In this dream I\\u2019m at my dad and stepmother\\u2019s cottage. It\\u2019s located in the Boreal Forest and the forest is so thick that you can\\u2019t possibly walk through it. There\\u2019s no path. There\\u2019s no space between the trees and the underbrush. So, there\\u2019s just a clearing. My stepmother makes sure that I understand I\\u2019m not allowed to sleep in the main cottage, so I have a cabana - a small one room that fits a single bed cot. There\\u2019s nothing else in it, just a cot. It\\u2019s made of wood and it has a roof and a door. This is where I sleep and I have a flying machine - it\\u2019s made of metal and taffeta - weather-proof material that tents are made out of and actually windsurfer sails are also made out of it. It\\u2019s like a parasailor. I think in real life, people are led up to gliders to a cliff and then they\\u2019re strapped in and then they glide all the way down. This is what it is, only it has a bottom, so I can actually cross my legs, sit in the stretched taffeta material and operate the lever that will lift the wings out so I can go higher or lower that one side of the wing down so I start to come back down towards the earth. So I\\u2019m wearing a dress and I walk from my cabana down to the shore, get in my flying machine, and the wind just takes me up. And it\\u2019s amazing. It\\u2019s so quiet up there - the quiet has texture to it and it just goes through my whole body and I orgasm. I fly around for a while and then I shift the gear and come back down and land the plane. I\\u2019ve done this before and I have a picture of me flying it with a friend in it. The friend is there on the shore, but she won\\u2019t come up with me in it, although the dream is in multiple timelines so I know she has. She just doesn\\u2019t during this particular dream. And then my stepmother creates some drama. She doesn\\u2019t want it on the dock and stuff, so I speak to a neighbor and the neighbor tells me it\\u2019s fine to leave it there. So I go up in it again and fly around and it\\u2019s just so peaceful and so freeing and then I land it when it\\u2019s time down on the neighbor\\u2019s dock. My stepmother is a little bit pissed off, but what can I say, it\\u2019s not her dock. So I go and sleep in the cabana and listen to the birds and the sounds of nature. I go up and down in this thing multiple times. I try to convince my friend to come with me, but she\\u2019s scared. I take her for a dry run in it where we don\\u2019t leave the land. She doesn\\u2019t want to go in it though, so she just wanders off. I fly in it again, land it, and then in the dream, I become bored with doing this in this one particular place. I\\u2019m not really welcomed in the cottage, so I decide to do something else and the dream exits that forest and I go back to the city.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fortune Teller\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It\\u2019s summer. It\\u2019s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It\\u2019s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I\\u2019m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I\\u2019m with some friends. I can\\u2019t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt. She\\u2019s in the boat that I\\u2019m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She\\u2019s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I\\u2019ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who\\u2019s driving the boat is not me. It\\u2019s a motorboat - something I don\\u2019t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I\\u2019m hazy on one that is - it\\u2019s not water skiing, it\\u2019s not floating, I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we\\u2019re staying. I guess I\\u2019m in a motel because it\\u2019s on the ground. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I\\u2019m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It\\u2019s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it\\u2019s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There\\u2019s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it\\u2019s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I\\u2019ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there\\u2019s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They\\u2019ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that\\u2019s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she\\u2019s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she\\u2019s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she\\u2019s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that\\u2019s complete. So they\\u2019re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life\\u2019s purpose. I\\u2019m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I\\u2019m really surprised that she\\u2019s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there\\u2019s somebody ahead of me. I don\\u2019t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don\\u2019t go in with her and I haven\\u2019t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she\\u2019s advertised. I don\\u2019t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She\\u2019s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She\\u2019s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she\\u2019s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they\\u2019re laughing like, \\u201cWow! I can\\u2019t imagine myself doing this!\\u201d Or \\u201cI\\u2019m so surprised at what she said!\\u201d These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They\\u2019re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it\\u2019s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it\\u2019s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren\\u2019t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I\\u2019m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She\\u2019s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It\\u2019s a woman I know. I\\u2019m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life\\u2019s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there\\u2019s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she\\u2019s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives. She says, \\u201cWow I\\u2019ve made $350 doing this.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a \\u201cwho knew?!\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou are making this up?\\u201d She\\u2019s speaking as though she\\u2019s making it up. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fun House\\u201d We are at a carnival. It\\u2019s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I\\u2019m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don\\u2019t really want to because I know they aren\\u2019t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they\\u2019re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she\\u2019s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that\\u2019s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I\\u2019ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They\\u2019re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She\\u2019s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it\\u2019s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We\\u2019re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there\\u2019s a door. It brings us into something we\\u2019re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We\\u2019re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don\\u2019t have the shoes on because I\\u2019m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they\\u2019re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn\\u2019t make me put the shoes on. I\\u2019m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she\\u2019s glaring at me, I also retort, \\u201cWould I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.\\u201d I think I said Christian, but I can\\u2019t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she\\u2019s moved back and I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good. Maybe she won\\u2019t bother me anymore.\\u201d On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a window, but it\\u2019s close to the ground - it\\u2019s a crawlspace. She\\u2019s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She\\u2019s looking at something on the other side. I don\\u2019t feel like crawling there. I can see that she\\u2019s jumping up and down. She\\u2019s excited about what she sees, so I\\u2019m content to sit on the other side and wait until she\\u2019s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it\\u2019s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she\\u2019s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It\\u2019s dark. We don\\u2019t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it\\u2019s dissonant. It\\u2019s really unpleasant. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.\\u201d So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it\\u2019s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he\\u2019s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She\\u2019s a naturopath. She\\u2019s there with Trisha. i wonder what they\\u2019re doing because the carnival doesn\\u2019t seem like their thing. I\\u2019m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d Instead of staying on the ground, we\\u2019re suddenly transported upwards a little. I\\u2019d say we\\u2019re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They\\u2019re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they\\u2019re ants and they\\u2019re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He\\u2019s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he\\u2019s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn\\u2019t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Grid\\u201d In my dream last night, I\\u2019m a time traveler. The framework of the dream is set up on a grid system. I have lived in Toronto, Ontario, but I don\\u2019t live there now (for a short period of time I was there) and it\\u2019s a very easy city to get to know if you spend some time on the grid, which is a north-south-east-west system. In the dream, if you stop at a washroom or go down into the subway, you end up in a different time zone when you come out. So the whole dream is me trying to gather people together so that we\\u2019re all going into these wormholes at the same time so we don\\u2019t lose each other. The interesting thing is I keep waking up out of this dream and then going back to sleep and simply picking up where it left off. But every time I go back to sleep. I\\u2019m trying to regather the people that I was with before I woke up. The dream starts and I\\u2019m with my own family and one of the places in the grid is a restaurant, but it\\u2019s one of the older kinds of restaurants where the upstairs also has sleeping rooms for travelers. Not all of the people in that time zone are good people, so I\\u2019m warning my daughter to stay away from one of these girls because I can just tell by the look of her that she\\u2019s a thief and a prostitute. She\\u2019s sizing us up and I know if we don\\u2019t keep our money and valuables safe, she will steal from us. I\\u2019m trying to get the door of the restaurant locked because the prostitute has gone off with Omar and I don\\u2019t want her to come back in because I don\\u2019t want her to follow us through the next wormhole. So I do manage to keep the door locked and the prostitute comes out an hour later from the doorway and she has only her underwear on and her bra and she\\u2019s saying she\\u2019s desperately trying to get in and I know this is part of the trick because I can tell by her face that she\\u2019s not really upset. And I just know this. I do manage to succeed in convincing them to keep the door locked. Then I see her coming out of a different doorway about five minutes later. She gets up and she\\u2019s fully dressed and I can see in her hand that she has two different wallets, so she managed to get them from someone else, but not us. So this is going to sound funny, but it\\u2019s winter in the dream on the grid, and I\\u2019ve got my kids\\u2019 things to carry plus some supplies - food and an extra change of clothes. And my daughter is pushing me around in a shopping cart - she keeps telling me to get in with my stuff and it\\u2019s hard to push it because it\\u2019s a shopping cart and the snow keeps building up on the wheels. So we\\u2019re putting the heavy things in there and I\\u2019m having a hard time pushing it and my daughter keeps wanting me to get in there and rest, and she is pushing me around so we look like homeless people. We go into this other portal and come out on the other side and it\\u2019s a party. It\\u2019s packed with people and there are people that I know. So, one of these couples that I know are people that I know from the Sail Club, and I realize that the man is screwing around on the woman and I think, \\u201cOh no, that\\u2019s horrible!\\u201d And I wrestle with the idea of telling her. And I don\\u2019t yet because it\\u2019s a really tough decision to make and is it any of my business, and what effects of that decision will it have on others. So while I\\u2019m wrestling with that decision, I realize that she is actually aware of it and just doesn\\u2019t appear to either care or acknowledge it, so I don\\u2019t tell her. In the same scene, there\\u2019s another little girl and she\\u2019s being shadowed by a teenage girl. So the first girl is 8 and the other is maybe 16. They go into the showers and I\\u2019m standing there because I\\u2019m on this other girl because of the shadowing. So they both get into the same shower and I\\u2019m thinking this isn\\u2019t right. And then I walk in and look and they are showering together and they are undressed. I step in and open the door and I ask the younger girl, \\u201cAre you alright?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t answer me. So I glare at the other one and fierce her down and take the younger girl and put some clothes on her because her clothes have disappeared, so I\\u2019m just taking some various things and covering her up with them. I say, \\u201cIs this yours? Is this yours?\\u201d and people say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not mine,\\u201d and so I put a various eclectic wardrobe on her. And then I\\u2019m wandering around the party with her in my hand asking anyone if they know who this girl is because she doesn\\u2019t talk. People will say, \\u201cOh, I saw her with so and so,\\u201d and then the so and so won\\u2019t be there and there\\u2019s different so and so\\u2019s every time and I can\\u2019t find who this girl belongs to. But then I\\u2019m starting to get concerned that I\\u2019m getting sucked into or overly involved with the dynamics of the people at this party and I\\u2019m afraid that I will forget that I\\u2019m a time traveler and that I\\u2019ll lose my time traveler family, so I start to gather up the people that I came with - my daughter, some other nameless people who are just there, they are part of my travel group - and I\\u2019m looking for someone now. I say I need someone to take care of her for me, and this couple - the oblivious woman and the man who is screwing around on her all the time - say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take her. We\\u2019ll love her. We love everybody.\\u201d In the dream I\\u2019m not concerned that she\\u2019ll be sexually abused. I know that they are going to take care of her. They\\u2019re good people, they just have this other weird cake. And so I leave her with them and get back into the shopping cart outside of the door and we go down and I\\u2019m starting to recognize streets. I\\u2019m starting to look a lot more closely at the grid because I want to plan where we\\u2019re going and not just go into any door and be more conscious of the grid. I\\u2019m starting to feel more textures in the dream. So as I climb back in the cart, I\\u2019m feeling that the front handle of it is actually cold and it\\u2019s plastic feeling and the metal of the cart is even colder and I\\u2019m trying to pull the sleeve of my coat down over my hand so it won\\u2019t stick to it. It\\u2019s actually not that comfortable riding in it because the wheels keep getting stuck and it\\u2019s bumpy. But this is what she wants to do and I let her. We have some conversations. She\\u2019s still bothered by locking the prostitute out of the first scene, and I tell her that regardless of what we did she would still steal everyone\\u2019s wallets and she would still make the same choices and it\\u2019s not our purpose to try and change people\\u2019s choices here, but to learn the grid and to find our way through it. So I\\u2019m starting to read the signs and I\\u2019m recognizing where we are - what starts to become a sense of direction in the grid. My daughter keeps steering the cart. Now I don\\u2019t know where my consciousness goes during this - maybe I go to sleep in the dream and I wake up. Instead of staying on the grid we\\u2019ve gone off to side grid things and we\\u2019re in smaller parts because she likes them better because they are closer together and more intimate, but they don\\u2019t have any identifying characteristics. So it\\u2019s a lot harder for me to find the main patterns of the grid when she does this, but we do. So the second time I dive in and dive out, it\\u2019s me finding our way out of this non-identifiable part onto more of the main grid. And then we come to a wormhole that I know we\\u2019re supposed to go into and I don\\u2019t want to go in, so I linger outside of it. Now it\\u2019s just my daughter and I. Because she went off the grid, we lost the other people we were supposed to be traveling with. I\\u2019m hoping that by staying on the grid, we\\u2019ll find them the next time we pop up somewhere. I also think that maybe if we wait, they might pop up out of this wormhole because I think they\\u2019re going to be looking for us. So while we\\u2019re waiting around this one crossroads, I talk or make a connection with an older man. At first he\\u2019s just an older man. We just have a conversation about some kind of philosophy or something. I\\u2019m not really paying much attention to the conversation. Then we decide to go down into the wormhole and we do, and we\\u2019re staying together and I\\u2019m giving her instructions, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta make sure we don\\u2019t get separated. Don\\u2019t go off onto any areas without telling me.\\u201d We pop up successfully and I see the rest of the people that we\\u2019re supposed to be with and we rush and we connect back with them. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember exactly what they said, but they\\u2019re telling us what happened during their wormhole experience. The interesting thing about this as the dream is starting to come to a close is that together we find the next wormhole that we\\u2019re supposed to dive into, but people keep needing to go to the washroom. But I\\u2019m telling them they can\\u2019t do this because each washroom is a wormhole and we\\u2019re supposed to stay together. Some of them decide to do it anyway and I know that here we go again, we\\u2019re going to get sidetracked from our purpose. Well, we keep trying to find each other. And then I see this old man again and he\\u2019s standing up - he\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am. Now as I start talking to him I\\u2019m not just seeing him for what his profession is with small talk, but I start to feel beyond the surface of his skin into the character and kind of being he is, and he\\u2019s just so beautiful on the inside. My being feels his being. I tell him that once I go down into the wormhole, I won\\u2019t ever see him again. And he says, \\u201cyes, I know.\\u201d And then we just start to hug, but it\\u2019s the kind of hug where you just kind of fall into the other person - it\\u2019s not a squeezy hug, it\\u2019s just so enveloping and I just stand there. It seems like five minutes go by and I\\u2019m so comforted by this hug. And I realize as we\\u2019re doing this that we also need to not get so preoccupied with staying on the grid, that we\\u2019re missing the connections with the people that are in between wormholes. And then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Inner City\\u201d In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It\\u2019s really hot. There\\u2019s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I\\u2019m inside a building. It\\u2019s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I\\u2019m helping people. I don\\u2019t know the people I\\u2019m working with. So I\\u2019m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It\\u2019s really oddly shaped. It\\u2019s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It\\u2019s covered with sticky potato. I think it\\u2019s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there\\u2019s this big hose thing that\\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. It\\u2019s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I\\u2019m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there\\u2019s a sieve thing on it. I\\u2019m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they\\u2019re moving really fast. They\\u2019re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She\\u2019s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I\\u2019m helping. I feel like she\\u2019s centered me out as though I\\u2019m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn\\u2019t up to par. It\\u2019s a whole demeanor like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to watch you even closer.\\u201d She\\u2019s making me nervous now. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I\\u2019m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They\\u2019re trying to speed up and they\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can\\u2019t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There\\u2019s a ramp and there\\u2019s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I\\u2019ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I\\u2019m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don\\u2019t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I\\u2019m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They\\u2019re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She\\u2019s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there\\u2019s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t she put the bigger rock that\\u2019s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?\\u201d Now I notice that she\\u2019s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she\\u2019s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She\\u2019s calling the thigh bone a \\u201cfemoris\\u201d but in a sing-song type voice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cUh, no!\\u201d But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, \\u201cI wonder if they knew she was in there?\\u201d I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We\\u2019re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There\\u2019s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we\\u2019re instructed to sit back into child\\u2019s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It\\u2019s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I\\u2019m stretching and there\\u2019s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don\\u2019t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I\\u2019m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I\\u2019m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I\\u2019m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I\\u2019m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone\\u2019s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I\\u2019m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Island of Avalon\\u201d I\\u2019m in a flatbed boat like a pontoon boat with several people, some of them I don\\u2019t know. There\\u2019s a woman with dark hair pulled back into a bun. She has higher cheekbones and slightly Asian features. I have two friends who I do know in real life - Julie and Alice, Keith and a couple other people who I don't interact with enough to see their features, so I can\\u2019t describe them or give them names. We are on a daytrip to an island. For our entertainment, we have each brought a guitar. I have mine, although I don\\u2019t take it out of its pack. Alice has one. Julie is playing something that sounds like a guitar but it has no body, just a neck which looks like a broom handle with a string that goes from one end to the other and acts like a guitar strap so you can put it around the back of your neck. She\\u2019s playing a non-existent fretboard. Her hands go up and down the broom handle making guitar-like sounds. When Alice brings hers out I comment that I didn\\u2019t realize she could play the guitar. She says she\\u2019s been playing for some time. It\\u2019s a sunny day - the skies are blue, it\\u2019s pleasant and balmy. The waters are a bit choppy but it\\u2019s not alarming in any sense, so everybody is kind of relaxed. The woman with the dark hair in a bun says we\\u2019ll be arriving in a couple of hours so just continue what we\\u2019re doing which is playing songs. Alice is leading the song. She plays the first fret, second fret, then up to fourth fret in bar chords. I get my guitar out and using the same fretboard pattern I begin to pick out a melody. At one point she stops me, corrects me and tells me that she\\u2019s playing a finger pattern with E Major with the first index finger barring the strings on the first, second and fourth fret. I tell her that\\u2019s exactly what I was doing. She sits back down. We eventually get close to the island. The woman with the dark hair bun tells us we\\u2019ll be there in a few minutes, so we all start stowing away what we\\u2019ve got out and putting it into our packs so we\\u2019re organized. We pull up to a dock and tie up. Everybody gets out, walks up the dock, up a path and into a small cottage. Inside the cottage, we put various things away. People eat. There is some discussion and conversation during the making of food, but it\\u2019s not a community meal because we\\u2019ve each brought our own things. So basically we\\u2019re just cooking it up then eating. There is some kind of event that we\\u2019ve come for. When it\\u2019s announced, because it\\u2019s all couples I say I\\u2019m going to stay behind. The woman says, \\u201cAre you sure? There will be dancing after.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not doing this couples thing by myself.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve elected to stay behind. However, after the meal, we walk back to the boat and I\\u2019m needed to help cast off. So I do this. Then I linger for a little while on the dock while the others sail off on the small barge. I stay there and am relaxing, feeling my breath and lying on my back looking up at the sky, feeling the gentle movement of the water. I don\\u2019t know how long I stay there, but it\\u2019s still daylight when I decide to go back to the small cottage. When I arrive there I see my friend Keith has also stayed back and he\\u2019s putting some things into his pockets. He has something the size and shape of an aerosol can. He takes that in one hand and takes the lid from a deep pocket in his pants and places it on. Then he\\u2019s taking something else out of his back pocket that I realize is a used condom and I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder what he\\u2019s been doing...or it\\u2019s obvious what he\\u2019s been doing while we were gone.\\u201d He\\u2019s about to dispose of these items in the garbage when the woman with dark hair comes back in and he hurriedly tucks them back in his pocket. He doesn\\u2019t want her to see. She tells us that if we want to find out what happened ten years ago, we\\u2019d better hurry but we\\u2019re not to let on we\\u2019re looking for this or the people that live here will not share information. So we exit out the cottage following her deeper into the island. We\\u2019re in a gathering place in a village. There are people, but when I look at them, I sense that they\\u2019ve lived there for generations and are not used to strangers because they\\u2019re staring at us oddly. It\\u2019s not an entirely welcoming stare as I interpret hostility. We are looking for some indication that a cataclysmic event happened ten years ago. So we are looking for disruptions in the smooth running of events or maybe that the town hall is missing some dates of town hall meetings from ten years ago. In fact, we find this evidence on the front of the town hall, itself! There\\u2019s a pole in front of the town hall building that has dates etched into it and there is a disruption. That\\u2019s when I see that the name of the island is Avalon. There\\u2019s a period of time where there are no dates and it is in fact ten years ago. I try not to react or look at my companions as though I\\u2019ve noticed something. We continue to wander around the village looking for such evidence as to corroborate this. The sky begins to be less bright. I look up and notice the sun is beginning to set. I realize we must make our way back to the cottage we\\u2019re staying in. Without verbalizing this to my companions, we just begin to retrace our steps back to the path to the cottage. By the time we get to the cottage, it\\u2019s twilight. We go in. we\\u2019re having a discussion - the dark haired lady, Keith and me - about what we\\u2019ve found. We each found different things to confirm that something tragic happened there ten years ago. The people who live there either don\\u2019t remember and have some kind of amnesia or they do remember, but are refusing to talk about it and don\\u2019t want anyone else to know. While we\\u2019re having this discussion, the rest of the group that went to the event come back in and they are not there to track what we\\u2019re tracking. At this point, my recall is not sharp. There\\u2019s no sleeping or staying overnight in the cottage. We simply leave the next day and it\\u2019s daylight. The other friends that attended the event are oblivious of what we\\u2019ve done and we\\u2019re simply back in the little barge with the same guitars singing the same songs and heading away from the island as though the island didn\\u2019t even really exist and we never even stopped there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Kingdom\\u201d I arrive. The road here was bumpy. I step out and walk in through a stone archway into an open area. I am greeted by a few people I appear to know already. They\\u2019re telling me some news and saying that the king has been very sad lately and is not doing well at all. They haven\\u2019t seen him in a little while, but he\\u2019s still there. We go through the open stone area - it\\u2019s a large room made of stone. We go out a side opening. Everything is very rocky and I realize this whole structure is built on the side of an escarpment. It\\u2019s built into the rock that\\u2019s part of the escarpment. I walk downhill over this rocky dry land. I come to a lower area. There are some more people, maybe 3 or 4. I think they\\u2019re fishing. Some people are standing in the water up to their thighs. I don\\u2019t really understand the clothing. Some have rolled their clothing up to the top of their thighs. Others are wearing muslin over top and it\\u2019s getting wet in the water but no one seems to care. I go in the water and roll my dress up and tuck it in. I can feel the skin on my legs and the coolness of the water. I can feel the rocks under my feet and some of them are a bit slippery and some are a bit sharp. I have to go in the water very, very carefully. I\\u2019m only standing in the water for a few minutes when a young man comes towards me. He seems to have some kind of authority. I also know him really well. We converse for a little bit. He tells me of some of the problems. He tells me there\\u2019s been some changes and deaths. Basically, I gather that everything is still intact. At this point I realize there\\u2019s another property. There\\u2019s a road that goes from the property we have, down into where the rocks descend in altitude and then ascend again to this other property. Everyone calls this other property a castle. But no one has been there for a really long time because the king hasn\\u2019t wanted to go there. The reason there\\u2019s activity right now is that he\\u2019s decided that he\\u2019s going to open it up again, so there\\u2019s preparations and excitement in the air. At this point, the conversation is that the king is coming down or getting up - I\\u2019m not sure which one. There\\u2019s another young man who is older than my friend. People are calling him the prince. I see the King and he has painted his skin with woad. He\\u2019s been doing this for a long time. People are saying it\\u2019s because of his grief. The woad painting is part of this culture and it\\u2019s not unusual to anyone. We ascend back up the rocky part I had just climbed down. Now my friend - the younger prince - is holding my elbow because now I\\u2019m wet and barefoot. We go back into the original opening in the rock that I arrived into. Now the king comes in this same opening. I see that his face is lined more with a lot more wrinkles. The woad is covering some of the wrinkles. He\\u2019s also used some kind of black powder to create upward sweeps between his brows to his brow line and from his bottom lip down through the center of his chin. It\\u2019s making him look angrier and more expressive of that emotion. I can see underneath all this paint to the face I have known before. Everything is made out of this rock from the land. There\\u2019s a rock inside here that we use as a seat. We sit. He starts talking to me. He feels like a fatherly figure but I get the impression that he is not my father. He sits down and tells me that we\\u2019re going to be opening the other part today and he\\u2019s ready to finally face this challenge. He\\u2019s also looking forward to it because it\\u2019s reuniting everyone in his kingdom. It\\u2019s difficult to get to, though. The road is overgrown. He indicates that there\\u2019s been a zipline installed at the top of this open window carved into the rock. Everyone is going to have to zipline down to the other castle. I agree and say, \\u201cThis is fine, I can do that.\\u201d My friend tells me he appreciates me being there. At this point, two men in suits enter in through the opening. They\\u2019re smiling. The king stands up and greets them. They tell him that they have some good news for him. They start talking, telling him that someone wants to give him some money for a piece of the road. They say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got it all written up on this contract. It will all be very friendly. You\\u2019ll get all this money and it\\u2019s just for this one section of road that goes from this piece of land to the castle.\\u201d I can feel myself getting really angry inside. I look over at the king and he seems to be considering it, which makes me even more angry. All of a sudden I stand up and yell at them: \\u201cHow dare you come in here with your lies! You tell him that this will be okay. I know you\\u2019re going to trick him. You\\u2019re going to get him to sell that and then he won\\u2019t have any access to his home. You\\u2019re trying to force him through this treachery to sell his own home.\\u201d Now they\\u2019re really angry. The king says, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019m not going to do that.\\u201d He yells at them and tells them to get out. They pack up their papers and leave. Nobody says anything to me about my outburst. The preparations continue. Each person is holding one thing. Suddenly I look down and see if I have some kind of tray. There are a whole bunch of things on it, but I don\\u2019t know what they are. My mind thinks: \\u201cHow are they going to stay on while on a zipline? Aren\\u2019t they going to fly off?\\u201d We start going towards the opening. The oldest son takes the zipline first. You can\\u2019t even see him at first - he goes way down and then he goes up and through the trees. I think it looks like he made it. My conscious mind is thinking this looks more like a T-bar from a ski hill. Another one arrives but I let it go past just in case the older one slows down when he goes up the last ascension. Then I put the tray on this next one. As I watch it go on the zipline, nothing slides off. I think, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d Then I take the next one. I grab on, sit on the T-bar part and zipline down. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Language\\u201d This dream is a little complicated to explain. The best way I can lay out the architecture is that it\\u2019s kind of like a spiral. The first layer, when I go through it, I\\u2019m not quite in it, then each layer I'm a little deeper in. There\\u2019s also a vehicle for getting there and I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It doesn't move on the land. It\\u2019s not an airplane. It doesn\\u2019t go way high up in the sky. It hovers a little above the rooftops - perhaps the layer where birds are normally in, though I don\\u2019t see any birds in the dream. It moves really quickly. It moves through time, as well. So the dream begins. I\\u2019m exiting out of this vehicle into a town. I\\u2019m walking around the town looking for where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I don\\u2019t understand any of the language being spoken. So, I can\\u2019t ask anyone where to go. I\\u2019m just trying to feel my way around. I\\u2019m looking for a mental map of the things I need. For example, I\\u2019m looking for a place to eat, a place to study, a place to sleep. So the first time I go through here, I\\u2019m feeling ungrounded. I\\u2019m alienated because I don\\u2019t speak the language. But I\\u2019m starting to feel familiar with the urban landscape. There's a certain time I have to leave. I need to be back at that vehicle. So I\\u2019m rushing to get there. I get back in it and I leave. Then I re-enter that same town, exiting the vehicle. This time I\\u2019m looking for parks and recreational places. I\\u2019m looking for a place to swim and rest outside - not necessarily a beach, but a place I can rest after swimming. This time I have my son with me. We have found a place to rent bicycles and have rented a tandem bicycle. So I place my son on the back and I\\u2019m on the front. We both have little backpacks with what we need for the day. We are just leisurely riding around. We go to the place for swimming, not an ocean, I have a feeling it might be man made because it\\u2019s too small to be a lake. It\\u2019s quite beautiful. The water is clean and fresh, and there\\u2019s a groomed grassy area, as you would find in a park. We lay down some big towels that we\\u2019ve taken from our backpacks and we\\u2019re just lying there resting. It\\u2019s a nice day. After a little while we get hungry. I\\u2019ve already scouted a place where we can eat. So we get back on the bicycles and take our towels and everything with us. But our towels are wet and I notice that they\\u2019re wet when I put them in the packs. I\\u2019m thinking that we\\u2019ll need a place to spread them out so they don\\u2019t get moldy. So I take my son on the bicycle. We go to the place to eat. The food is good and tasty. I\\u2019m trying to decipher the language that the people speak. As I taste the food, I\\u2019m trying to taste the language. I\\u2019m trying to decipher it by noticing the flavors. When we\\u2019re both finished, instead of getting back on the bicycle, we walk through the urban area where we\\u2019ve eaten. I think, \\u201cWow, it would be really nice to have some kind of memento from the day.\\u201d So we enter one of the shops. It\\u2019s quite dingy. There are tables set out in garage sale type style. To enter the shop, you go through the door and downstairs to the basement, which is probably why it feels so dingy and dark. But the items on the table are quite expensive and big. A lot of them are made of big chunks of led crystal. I don\\u2019t want to carry something around like this - it\\u2019s not really my thing, anyway. They\\u2019re really rather formal. But we see this little spoon. It\\u2019s like a baby spoon, made of silver - it\\u2019s good metal. I look at the top of the spoon and it\\u2019s actually carved into - a rough rendition of Pikachu. I call my son over and say, \\u201cLook! Who\\u2019s that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cPikachu.\\u201d I say, yes. Pikachu is wearing a little hat with a small tiny delicate chain from the center of the hat down and there\\u2019s a hook on the end of it. There\\u2019s a hole drilled into the spoon and the hook sits there nicely, so it doesn\\u2019t dangle and it\\u2019s actually part of Pikachu\\u2019s hat. So I purchase the spoon and we put it in our backpack. Now I\\u2019m thinking we have to spread these towels. Now I\\u2019m wondering if we\\u2019re staying here and I\\u2019m starting to get a little bit nervous because it is getting dark. We don\\u2019t appear to be leaving in the vehicle and I haven\\u2019t arranged for us anywhere to sleep. So we\\u2019re back up on street level and I\\u2019m walking to where we entered this level. But then I see that more people are walking that way and I see the vehicle. We get in the vehicle and sleep on it. Nice passes really quickly, then we exit back out at daytime. This time I have both my son and daughter. My daughter is older than my son. I\\u2019m bringing them with me to a house that I\\u2019ve prearranged to meet someone in - someone I had forgotten that I met on the first voyage there. So we do this. We\\u2019re not on the bicycle this time, we\\u2019re just walking. We get to the house and there\\u2019s a library upstairs. So I take my kids up to the third floor and they\\u2019re in the library. Then I walk back to the first floor to meet the person I\\u2019m supposed to be studying the language with. It\\u2019s someone I feel I\\u2019ve met before - there\\u2019s some familiarity about the man. We sit at a table and he\\u2019s teaching me a word and I\\u2019m repeating it - that\\u2019s how I\\u2019m learning, back and forth rote memory style. Then I ask him, \\u201cIs there a washing machine here? I still have these things from the picnic and I need to wash and dry them. They are muddy and wet.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, there\\u2019s one in the basement. Help yourself.\\u201d So I take everything down, load the washing machine, put soap in it, and come back upstairs. Then I realize I\\u2019ve put my muddy pants in there and I\\u2019m just wearing my underwear and the shirt I had on underneath. I ask him if there\\u2019s anything I can borrow. He says, yes. He hands me a pair of pajama bottoms. So I wear those and we continue the language lesson. We continue for a bit longer, then I go back downstairs to switch the laundry and put things in the dryer. I come back up the stairs. This time, there\\u2019s a second person in there for a language lesson. I also recognize him - he\\u2019s a colleague. So now the first man I was learning from is tutoring someone else and I\\u2019m practicing the language with my colleague, Keith. We both have a test coming up and we\\u2019re studying together practicing this language. The first man who is the tutor comes back into the room with Keith and me. He says the time is up. Keith leaves. I go back and get our laundry and put in our packs. I thank the man for his time. My kids have come downstairs from the library and we get our packs. I never take the test. We just get back in the vehicle and leave. There\\u2019s one more layer where I come back. I exit the same vehicle into a landscape with the same kind of architecture. This time I don\\u2019t have my kids. I walk to the place where I had picnicked with my son. I\\u2019m taking my time. It\\u2019s a nice day. The weather is temperate - not too hot, not too cold. I\\u2019m not swimming. I\\u2019m just lying on the grass in meditation, looking at the clear blue sky. I rest there for some time. It feels really good. The day is only half gone and the vehicle isn\\u2019t coming back until the end of the day. So I still have half a day to spend. I don\\u2019t want to stay by the beach anymore. So I walk back through the small town. I\\u2019m not feeling particularly hungry. I end up at the house where I had studied before. Before I go in, I see the same man that had tutored me. There\\u2019s still a nagging question in my mind about where I had seen him before. He waves over to me and indicates that I should come in even though I don\\u2019t have an appointment. We go back into the room where I had the tutoring session before. He indicates with his hand that I should sit down. So I do. Only this time he has a plate of food. He divides it into two and pushes one plate over to me and keeps the other plate for himself. I\\u2019m eating this really, really slowly, trying to figure out the flavors. I don't even know what the food pieces are. So I\\u2019m eating slowly and thinking about it. He hands me this other thing. It is the size of a potato, but not as hard as a raw potato. It feels like a thick, doughy thing. I wonder what it is. He indicates that I should dip it into the food, then take a bite. So I do. It tastes somewhat bread like, but doughier. I still don\\u2019t understand the spices. Actually I don\\u2019t like the texture of it. After the first bite, I set it back down and continue to eat the food with my fingers. Then I wish I had the spoon I bought last time and gave to my son. Then he gets up and indicates for me to look at my legs. I see that my pants are all muddy again. He asks me in the language if I want to use the washing machine. I say yes. Then I stand there for a second. He takes that same soft pajama-like thing out of the door and hands it to me. So I go back downstairs to where the laundry is and I take the rest of the things from my pack because they aren\\u2019t clean either. I put everything into the washing machine and come back up with the soft clothing on. Now he\\u2019s sitting down on the floor. There\\u2019s something on the television, which I hadn\\u2019t noticed was there. I sit down on the floor beside him. I don\\u2019t understand the language that the people on the tv are using. So I kind of drift off and am daydreaming. I am just waiting for the laundry to finish. He comes over a little closer to me and I feel that there\\u2019s some kind of sexual energy between us. Then I suddenly remember who he is. He\\u2019s someone I had tea with on a meetup - I was just meeting him, but we never went on a date. But there\\u2019s energy there. He just brushes down my arm, down the side of my leg with his hand, like he is testing to see where this is going to go. I do feel my body respond - it\\u2019s warm. But I don\\u2019t really want to engage with him that way. I still acknowledge that it felt nice, though. He backs away, but doesn't go too far. He seems content with just acknowledging that the energy is there but not taking it any further. Then we move closer to each other again and just stay there, touching, until I think my laundry is done. Then I go to the basement, get the laundry, change and give him back the pajamas he lent me and go out the door to the vehicle to fly off somewhere.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Line Up\\u201d I\\u2019m in a doctor\\u2019s office but it\\u2019s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I\\u2019ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We\\u2019re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There\\u2019s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren\\u2019t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we\\u2019re looking at is the demographic of people who don\\u2019t believe in paying their bills online or don\\u2019t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can\\u2019t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we\\u2019re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they\\u2019re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It\\u2019s mostly elderly people. But there\\u2019s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It\\u2019s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I\\u2019m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, \\u201cMy appointment was at 8. It\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?\\u201d The receptionist who looks like my son\\u2019s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. This isn\\u2019t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone\\u2019s appointment was scheduled for 8am.\\u201d I feel like screaming at her but I don\\u2019t. I tell her that I understand it\\u2019s not her fault, but inside I\\u2019m frustrated and angry. I\\u2019m dizzy and starting to get a headache. I go back and sit down. Now it\\u2019s almost 5pm. There is a person that does the procedure I came for and I know they tend to leave a little bit earlier than the rest of the staff. I go back to the desk and say, \\u201cAm I still going to be able to get this done today?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you have two choices. You can wait until we open in the morning or I can give you this syringe and you can inject yourself at home. You still have to wait for your appointment.\\u201dI have this dissonance between my inner landscape which is angry and frustrated and tired and hungry and thirsty with what I\\u2019m saying to her. I tell her I\\u2019ll take the syringe full of medicine. Then I say, \\u201cWell wait a sec, if I have to stay anyways, is she going to be back tomorrow?\\u201d She tells me she is. I say, \\u201cWell nevermind then, I might as well wait and have her do it properly since I have to stay here overnight anyway.\\u201d She hands it to me anyway, and says, \\u201cWell take it just in case.\\u201d She hands me a syringe full of liquid medicine. I go back and realize that while I\\u2019ve been talking to her someone who arrived after me has gone in and got their appointment. I\\u2019m unbelievably agitated. I also realize this is just great, I\\u2019m going to have to stay overnight because you\\u2019re not allowed to go home. If you go home they put you back in the line up, so it\\u2019s a never ending cycle of having to wait from 8am until the end of the day when they can\\u2019t even take you. I push two chairs together and try and stretch my body across the chairs. My friend is doing the same thing. We take off our coats and use them as pillows and lie down. The night passes with me not being able to sleep because I\\u2019m too hungry and too thirsty. I wish I had water. I\\u2019m feeling that restlessness in your legs from not getting enough exercise. So, I start to walk around the building. I walk around twenty times and then come back in and it\\u2019s past midnight. I get back in the chairs and go to sleep. I sleep for maybe five minutes and am woken up. Some part of the chair is sticking in my back - it\\u2019s wooden and pressing in my thigh so I feel like I\\u2019m getting a bruise. I stay awake until I see the morning light coming into the building. I sit up in my chair and see the people come back to the desk. I feel like threatening them somehow and saying I\\u2019d better be first! That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Long Anxious Drive\\u201d I\\u2019m in a car. There are two people in the front seat and I\\u2019m in the back seat. The person on the driver\\u2019s side is male. He has dark hair and those sideburns that I think they call lamb chops or dog ears because they come down from the temples and into this ear-shape around the jaw line and towards the chin, and they\\u2019re a bit long because I can see them sticking out from his face. He has two cars and I\\u2019m saying to him: \\u201cWhy would you pick this car instead of your other car? There\\u2019s only one car like this and it stands out. Now we\\u2019re going to be really obvious.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t reply. We\\u2019re stuck with it now because if we go back to his house to switch cars, the police will know that we\\u2019re there. We\\u2019re trying to avoid being detected by the police. We\\u2019re trying to avoid being caught. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019ve done. There\\u2019s nothing in the car and it\\u2019s almost as though we didn\\u2019t do anything but we can\\u2019t prove our innocence. So we have to avoid detection. We\\u2019re also trying to get to a particular destination. This is also what\\u2019s adding to the anxiety. The driver is sticking to the main roads. I\\u2019ve told him several times that if he just goes off the main road there\\u2019s a whole grid of side roads that will take us the same direction, but the chances of getting caught on a side road are greatly reduced. First we\\u2019re on a highway. It looks like the old Number 7. Again, I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWhy are we on this highway? It\\u2019s the only main route that goes here and there are police on it all the time.\\u201d He finally agrees to go off on a side road, but it\\u2019s not the one I suggested, it\\u2019s the one that takes us in the opposite direction. I think at least that will shake the police for a little while because they\\u2019re going to be looking for us traveling the opposite way. We do this for an agonizingly long twenty minutes. It feels like hours where I notice every single little thing as I\\u2019m looking at the windows. I\\u2019m hypervigilant and looking out the back window to see if I can see a police car. My eyes are glued to the back window. Then I suggest again: \\u201cIf we turn around and take one of the side roads going the other way, we\\u2019ll be getting closer to our destination instead of farther away from it.\\u201d We\\u2019re running out of gas so we have to stop at a gas station. This makes me even more anxious because what if there is an APB out on the license plate and the gas station attendants report us. It\\u2019s just horrible. We stop for the gas. I\\u2019m watching the attendants and ready to jump back in the car if it looks like one of them is going for a phone. I\\u2019m standing at the back of the car to try and cover up the license plate with my body. It goes well at the gas station. We get back in the car. No one has called the police. We start going the other way. Then the driver, when we get to the highway again, he turns left so we\\u2019re on the highway. Now the highway has stop lights on it and every two minutes there\\u2019s a red light. This is making me crazy with anxiety because now we\\u2019re going even more slowly. I finally convince him to turn right so that we\\u2019re on a side road. I can relax a little. I realize how unbelievably tired I am, yet I still can\\u2019t go to sleep. They\\u2019re driving. I\\u2019m looking out the back window and I can see some headlights. By now it\\u2019s dark and all I can see are the headlights and they\\u2019re really, really bright. I think this is it, we\\u2019re done for. But then the car behind us with the headlights turns off to the right. I feel a little bit relieved. Then there\\u2019s a stop sign and the car stops. I have my eyes peeled out the back, I don\\u2019t see any cars coming. We start driving again. The whole dream goes on and on like this, painstakingly slow and horrible. Then I\\u2019m aware that I\\u2019m dreaming and I\\u2019m aware I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m aware of the dream. My conscious mind says it\\u2019s had enough and doesn\\u2019t want to dream this anymore, so I just get up and turn on the lights.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Monster Outside the Window\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m sleeping in a room on the upper floor of a house. I don\\u2019t recognize the house. It has two windows that are gabled. In front of one of the windows, entering in the room, is a closet - it is not a very big one. It has two bars on either side of it with clothes hanging on. It\\u2019s probably about 7 feet from the internal door of the closet to the window. I can see the window outside of the closet. It\\u2019s almost like the closet, if you look right at it is a closet with solid walls; but when I\\u2019m in bed, I can see what\\u2019s outside of the window - both of them at the same time. So it\\u2019s almost like the walls have color and appear to be dense, yet I can see through them. The dream starts with me going to bed and I wake up in the middle of the night. I can see there\\u2019s something terrible - something I\\u2019m afraid of - outside of the window. I\\u2019m afraid to move in my bed. I don\\u2019t go back to sleep and I stay there until the morning. The day just passes in a blur. Then I go back to bed and again, I\\u2019m trying to go to sleep, but I\\u2019m awake because I know that thing is going to come back and it\\u2019s going to be outside my window again. In fact, I start to realize that it\\u2019s always outside of the window. Then, as I\\u2019m lying in bed awake, I start to get a little bit curious about what exactly it is outside of the window. So I get out of my bed and I open the door and I peek into the closet. Nothing happens yet. So I open the door a little wider and I go a little bit more into the closet. Now I\\u2019m just standing in the closet. I can feel its presence through the window pane. I\\u2019m just standing there. As I\\u2019m standing there, my ex-husband comes into the room. He starts making noise and stuff. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing in here? Please stop.\\u201d He ignores me and comes into the closet. He says, \\u201cI have to get a shirt.\\u201d I tell him to stop, \\u201cStop doing that, you\\u2019re going to disturb it.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t. Then the thing starts to come closer to the window. Then I realize that my ex-husband and this thing are in some kind of tango together. I realize that it\\u2019s not actually me - I\\u2019m not involved with it. So I back out of the closet and into my room. Then, there\\u2019s some other event, but it\\u2019s like the first night of the dream where I know I get up, I don\\u2019t stay in my room, I go and do some other things\\u2026 but they turn into a blur. So I\\u2019m involved in this other event. Then I come back into the room and it\\u2019s night time again. My ex-husband is gone. I feel that thing that was outside of the window is now in the closet. But since I know that it kind of belongs to my ex-husband it\\u2019s not really there to scare me, I feel less frightened about it\\u2019s unknownness. So I try to get into my bed. This is pointless. I know there\\u2019s something in the closet. So I get up and again I creep over to the closet and I open the door a crack. I\\u2019m slightly afraid of what I\\u2019m going to see, but much less than the very first night. I open it up and there\\u2019s someone sitting in there. I don\\u2019t know who it is - it\\u2019s a stranger - and it\\u2019s not talking to me. It\\u2019s just sitting there. I stand there for a little while, unsure. Do I want to interact with it? But now I\\u2019ve opened the closet door, so what am I going to do now? It stands up and it\\u2019s a man. The stranger. Then the room shifts, it deconstructs and it\\u2019s not the bedroom with the gabled windows anymore. I\\u2019m in the front hall of a house, maybe it\\u2019s the main floor of this one because I had been on the upper floor in the bedroom. Then I\\u2019m involved with this other kind of transaction. Now the front door is opening and there\\u2019s someone on the other side of the door. A barter is going on. I\\u2019ve lost the rest of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Murder\\u201d I\\u2019m in an outdoor space. It\\u2019s nighttime. There are seven or eight really long, long tables set up one after the other after the other, making a long row of tables. People are gathered around the tables; some are sitting, some are standing. I\\u2019m at the second table from the back. There is a series of movements that people have to execute and they\\u2019re being judged and marked. The people who are doing the judging and marking are friendly and conversational. They go from table to table making small talk. Then they ask people: \\u201cAre you ready then?\\u201d The people respond, \\u201cyes\\u201d or \\u201cno, not quite.\\u201d So if they say yes, they go up to a space that\\u2019s around the front table and do the movements. Then basically they clear out after that. But not everyone is leaving; there\\u2019s still a lot of friendly chit-chat going on along the sides of the table. I\\u2019ve noticed that the wave of people getting up and finishing is getting closer to my table. I tell the people that I\\u2019m sitting with that it\\u2019s almost our time and maybe we should rehearse. So we do. One of the people is a spotter and holds out an arm. You have to somersault overtop the arm and land on your feet. Then the third person pierces cartilage that runs down the side of our neck, like an aquatic gill, with an instrument. It has to be done at exactly the right spot, or it will hurt. If you put it in the right spot, it won\\u2019t hurt. This also has to be done quickly. This is why some people are missing or doing the somersault improperly so they don\\u2019t land in the right place and straighten up in the right place in order to have this piercing. So it\\u2019s our turn now. The person who is judging this does come around and says: \\u201cAre you ready?\\u201d We say yes. I\\u2019m doing the somersault. There\\u2019s a taller woman doing the holding out of the arm. Then I\\u2019m also doing the piercing. So we go up to the clearing in front of the table. I\\u2019m about to do the somersault when there\\u2019s a commotion at the back. I see this couple that I noticed earlier when we were practicing in the arena. The woman is very tiny. She has short, closed-cropped dark hair. Her partner is a lot taller than she is. They look very similar and I think they might be brother and sister. I realize that when they were practicing, they had this intimacy of movement, almost like there was no separation of being. I remember noticing them before during the practice - they were skating and doing this beautifully connected intimate dance. I was marveling at how smooth it was. The commotion is that she has murdered her partner or her brother. She\\u2019s really upset. Now the people that are responsible for this event are investigating. So the group I\\u2019m with has to return to our table - we weren\\u2019t able to execute our somersault and piercing. We go back to the table and are sitting there awaiting instruction. Of the ongoing investigation, the accusation is floating around that the woman deliberately killed her male partner. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cThat can\\u2019t be right! How could it go from that beautiful and connected with the love that they shared change in that short period of time?\\u201d The investigation continues and there\\u2019s some talk between people. I can hear the people who were involved in the investigation reporting to each other. They are compiling a report. At first it seems like they\\u2019re gathering and will arrest her and take her away. She\\u2019s not actively sobbing, but she looks like she\\u2019s sobbing - her body posture looks like it\\u2019s sobbing but there is no sound coming out of her mouth and there are no tears coming out of her eyes. Suddenly someone else comes in with a question - they found something that discredits the conclusion that she murdered him and starts to report that it was an accident. Then the panic starts to settle down in the group. Some friends or family that she has are approaching her and taking her away with them. The kerfuffle starts to die down and it comes back to us that our turn is still next. We follow the crew of judges up to the area, properly execute the somersault and then I pierce the cartilage gill where I was supposed to, and we\\u2019re finished.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Night Walk\\u201d This dream starts in a house that\\u2019s mine. It\\u2019s a different kind of house - open concept. It\\u2019s two levels. There is a lot of space in the rooms. There aren\\u2019t a lot of contents in each room. I cook something for supper. It\\u2019s some kind of pasta with weird sauce. There\\u2019s this piece of chicken with breading on it. My conscious mind is thinking, \\u201cEw, I never make food like that.\\u201d The pasta is kind of dry and so is the chicken. I don\\u2019t make things with breading. I eat a little bit of supper and don\\u2019t really like it. I take about three bites and leave it. I tell my child - the child is a mixture of my son and daughter at the same time - we\\u2019re going to go for a walk after supper. It needs to be dark, so we are waiting until it gets dark. We leave out the house. I had something in my hand. The walk is down a path. We go out first through a field and then through an opening in some rocks which we go underneath. Then there is a fork and I say we need to take the path on the left. We climb up a steep ascent and navigate that. Then there\\u2019s a ridge to follow along. There\\u2019s a vista here before we climb up. Suddenly it zooms out and you can see how vast this landscape is - it\\u2019s like an escarpment and really quite beautiful. Then it zooms back in and we\\u2019re standing there. It\\u2019s a long hike. So we hike for probably half the night. I have this feeling in my body where it\\u2019s a tiny bit scary. But I have my child with me and I don\\u2019t want to communicate my own fear to my child. So I do quite well at appearing brave and courageous. The landscape is very pretty even in the night. There\\u2019s a feeling of lush. It feels Canadian with a mix of evergreen, deciduous trees. It\\u2019s cool, but not too cold or too hot. I can feel the packed dirt underneath my feet. It\\u2019s not too overgrown. It\\u2019s not a very wide path, so some of the grasses have grown into it. But you can still see the path ahead, so we aren\\u2019t night blind. There is enough light from the moon and the stars that we can see the path. So we hike and we get tired and our legs start to get a little bit sore. I say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s turn around and go back now.\\u201d So we do. We navigate exactly backwards. It\\u2019s uneventful. Nothing comes after us. There\\u2019s no need to run or hasten our pace. We arrive back at the house and I realize that whatever I had in my hand, I left there. So, my child sleeps, but I don\\u2019t. I leave the house and I meet someone else at a marina - it\\u2019s a complex of houses where people live. I\\u2019m meeting some friends there. There are lawn chairs set up in a circle. It\\u2019s an uncomfortable baby shower where people sit around in a circle talking stiffly in awkward small talk. There\\u2019s some kind of party game going on. One of the people grabs me by the hands and pulls me into the middle of the circle. I\\u2019m to stand there and grab the hands of two other people, then we lean back until there\\u2019s tension in the arms. Then that\\u2019s it. We stand back upright, let go, go back into our chairs. I wait and watch a few other people do the same kind of party trick. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhen is this thing going to be over?\\u201d One by one, people start to leave. I don\\u2019t linger. Then I\\u2019m caught by one of the people I know. She says, \\u201cCome on, we have to go visit my mom. She\\u2019s in one of these houses.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll do that.\\u201d As we enter into the house, I realize it\\u2019s another baby shower of some sort. There are bits of blue decoration - like the tissue paper kind - and blue balloons stuck to the wall. Finger foods have been set out everywhere. The mom stands up when she sees me, but then she tips over to one side. I realize that she\\u2019s had way too much to drink. In fact, she seems to have had more to drink than she seems to be aware of. She doesn\\u2019t seem to realize she\\u2019s staggering and banging into furniture. I feel compassion for her. I also hope she\\u2019ll sit down. She does. She still has this loopy unchanging happy smile on her face throughout this. It\\u2019s an unwavering expression. The rest of the people aren\\u2019t really engaging with each other. I get up and slowly back away out of the room and out the front door. I leave and go back to my house. I\\u2019m walking. It\\u2019s a fairly long walk and by the time I get there, it\\u2019s morning. My child wakes up. There\\u2019s this same dried pasta with a piece of chicken still in the pot. It\\u2019s in the exact same condition as it was the night before. Now it\\u2019s nighttime again. I tell my child that I forgot something on the walk and we need to do it again. Only this time, there\\u2019s not that same little bit of adrenaline going through my body where I feel slightly scared. We go through exactly the same steps to go on the walk. It\\u2019s dark, it\\u2019s at night. I wake up before I retrieve whatever it is that I left there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Nothing\\u201d It seems to me that my apathy and feeling of not belonging, not being able to play anywhere, or seeing that my skills are not needed or wanted anywhere has soaked into my dream...All it was is a dry, hot African steppe. There was nothing in it, no activity. Just a steppe.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Passageway\\u201d The property we have is like a winery in the sense that there are wild grape leaves growing everywhere. It\\u2019s old. The house is made of stone. There\\u2019s a lot of land. We don\\u2019t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it\\u2019s sustenance farming. We don\\u2019t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren\\u2019t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I\\u2019m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it\\u2019s not one big cohesive unit, it\\u2019s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn\\u2019t know were there. I\\u2019m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it\\u2019s not heated. My dad tells me that we have to go and take stock of what\\u2019s in the basement because he has to list the house for sale. My brother and I go down there. The basement is super creepy. There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There\\u2019s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I\\u2019m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there\\u2019s a passageway that leads off. It\\u2019s like a crawlspace and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going in there. I turn around and my brother is gone. I can see his torch light and he\\u2019s in there looking around. How can he do that?! He\\u2019s in it for about ten minutes. I\\u2019m not freaking out, I know he\\u2019s okay. Nothing bad has ever happened to us in this place. I trust it, it\\u2019s just creepy. I don\\u2019t like all the slimy scuttling things and I don\\u2019t want them in my hair. I\\u2019m on edge. He pops out and I say, \\u201cWhat did you find?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what he says. This isn\\u2019t the first time he\\u2019s been in there and he was checking on what he had in there. He says it\\u2019s good. Then we go back up the stairs which are really rickety, and up into the kitchen. There\\u2019s a dug out place beside the kitchen; it\\u2019s just dirt with big stones. My dad is standing there and he says, \\u201cAlright, let\\u2019s go take stock of what\\u2019s in the barn.\\u201d My brother and I still have our torches in our hands but we put them out when we came up the stairs. The torches are all made of wax and now they\\u2019re shorter with more wax drippings on the outside because of the time we spent in the basement. We go out the side opening. There aren\\u2019t any doors, just openings. The kitchen does have glass on the windows. We go over a meadow into this other place. The stones are piled up. They\\u2019ve been chipped away into roughly big square shapes and stacked on top of each other, sawed and stuffed into the cracks to keep the weather out. Grass and bits of organic matter and seeds have grown in the sod. This is what the whole thing is made of, every structure. Now we go into the structure my dad calls the barn. It has a side entrance made of this sod packed stone. We go in there. The whole thing is one big open space which is why my dad called it the barn, except we never had any animals. There had been animals at some other point. We look around. Again, we take our torches. But the torch in this structure has never been lit. My dad has the lit torch. When we get in there, my brother and I put ours on his. Mine won\\u2019t light. My brother\\u2019s did. I\\u2019m calling to them, \\u201cWait, wait, my torch isn't lit!\\u201d He comes back. Mine is being really stubborn and takes a little while to light. It does but it's very dim, it\\u2019s like it\\u2019s wet and it won\\u2019t stay going very well. I\\u2019m not doing anything except trying to keep up with them. There\\u2019s nothing in there. There\\u2019s a place we didn\\u2019t explore, it\\u2019s another passageway off the barn. My dad turns around and says, \\u201cOkay that\\u2019s good.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you sure? Because there\\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. We need to organize this so that when the real estate agent comes, we have all the categories of all the places on this property written down and they\\u2019re evaluated separately or we won\\u2019t get the value we deserve.\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care. I just want to sell it.\\u201d I think he makes some comment about his age and says it doesn\\u2019t matter due to his age. I\\u2019m arguing with him and say, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s precisely why you should get out of this property what you deserve. You\\u2019re not working anymore. This is what you have to support you through your age.\\u201d Now he\\u2019s thoughtful. He just doesn\\u2019t feel like doing it. My brother and I decide to finish it on our own. We leave the barn with my dad and walk around the outside. I see that there are so many different kinds of fruit growing around - wild cherries, peaches, quinces, pears and apples. I wish I had time to gather these and preserve them. Now we\\u2019re back in the kitchen and have a little bit to eat, just some bread and a wheel of cheese. I don\\u2019t eat any of it though, I just give it to my dad and brother. Some others who are part of our extended family come to the table that is handmade out of wood. There standing there. Some of them have fruit in their hands and are eating as they gather around. This is where I identify my daughter and her ex-boyfriend. I say, \\u201cWe need to go back down into the basement and take more stock of what\\u2019s there.\\u201d We do this. My brother spends a lot more time in that one passageway. He\\u2019s growing something in it. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to move that though. Whatever it is, you need to move it before the real estate agent comes.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, I know.\\u201d Then he gets thoughtful and I can tell he\\u2019s thinking where he\\u2019s going to move it. He says, \\u201cMaybe I\\u2019ll just move it further back because no one is going to go in there.\\u201d I think he\\u2019s right. I worry about him because no one knows how far it goes. No one has gone far back including him. This makes me feel on edge again. Now we exit the side building. The real estate agent and lawyers will be here shortly. No one has gone through the barn yet. My brother, daughter, her ex-boyfriend and I light our torches and go into the barn. Mine is doing the same thing where it won\\u2019t stay lit but the barn is brighter because there are now four torches. I see the passage at one end actually connects to the house, but instead of going underground, it goes above ground and I find it odd that we haven\\u2019t noticed this before. The odd thing is that even though there\\u2019s nothing there and the barn is a lot dryer and there are no creepy crawlies and webs and spiders and night living things the way the basement had, I always feel a presence at my back like beings you can\\u2019t see that are in there. It\\u2019s thick with them and I can feel it. We go through the bends of the passage and we end up behind the house. I say, \\u201cInstead of entering the house through the side, my dad\\u2019s probably in there with legal people, we should go underneath so we\\u2019re quiet and don\\u2019t interrupt them.\\u201d We agree to do this, but the passage takes us into where they are. We\\u2019re sneaking around trying to be really quiet and all of a sudden my dad and the lawyers see us and we all start laughing. I say, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t think you would be here. We were deliberately trying to be quiet so we wouldn't interrupt you.\\u201d My dad remarks, \\u201cWell you never know where the passages in this house are going to lead.\\u201d Everybody thinks this is funny so it takes some of the tension off. However, I can\\u2019t shake the feeling that there are other people living in this house who we haven\\u2019t found. As I\\u2019m saying this, I look up and see the glow of a torch from inside the wall and it\\u2019s way up high in the place between the room off the kitchen and the kitchen, it\\u2019s in that wall. The wild cherry vines had covered it up but the cherries have gotten really ripe and they\\u2019re falling off because they\\u2019re so heavy and ripe, so I can see this crack in the stone. I get my dad to lift me up. I\\u2019m heavy, an adult size, so I can feel his arms shaking. He can\\u2019t hold me up for very long. I got a glimpse of people in there! There\\u2019s a dad and a mom. He puts me down. I say, \\u201cYou need to lift me up again. I saw a man with a hat on.\\u201d Someone else lifts me up and this time the arms are steadier. I see a baby strapped onto the mom\\u2019s chest and a young boy the age of nine who has covered his face with the same kind of pointy hat his dad has. I notice the mom has one of those hats, too, but the point of hers is tipped over to the side. There\\u2019s a whole room we didn\\u2019t know about and they live in this room. He puts me down and I say, \\u201cWe need to find the passageway that leads there to tell them the house is being sold.\\u201d I think the buyer is going to tear it all down and I\\u2019m worried about this family. We go through the passage again only this time we\\u2019re looking at the walls trying to find cracks. I know where this should be directionally. But once we\\u2019re in the passageway, it\\u2019s hard to keep your sense of direction. We\\u2019re in the barn again and I feel the presence. I turn around and this time it startles me and there\\u2019s the man with the hat and veil over his face. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the man from the room in the wall.\\u201d He says yes and I share with him that it\\u2019s going to be sold and I think it\\u2019s going to be torn down. He says he has nowhere else to go with his family. My brother says, \\u201cWell there is somewhere else.\\u201d He indicates the passageway where he has been growing things. The man says, \\u201cOh we\\u2019ve come from there and I don\\u2019t know if I want to go back there with my wife and kids. I\\u2019ve considered it but my wife wants to stay where we are and take our chances.\\u201d The dream ends with us having this conversation of where there is to go after there and the sadness that someone would even think about tearing down this magical place that holds so much history. We\\u2019ve lived there and survived. The water is pumped from the ground with the handle. We have torches. We don\\u2019t need the electricity. We\\u2019ve been able to survive on the fruit around the house. I don\\u2019t want to leave and neither does the man with his family.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Photo Chest\\u201d I\\u2019m walking across a really long bridge. It feels a little bit cold and windy and as though I\\u2019m walking against the wind and uphill. The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that\\u2019s been empty for a few years. It\\u2019s where my daughter\\u2019s grandparents used to live. They\\u2019ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter\\u2019s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It\\u2019s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It\\u2019s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There\\u2019s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There\\u2019s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It\\u2019s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There\\u2019s one point where I\\u2019m a little bit surprised at Roberta\\u2019s description. They aren\\u2019t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter\\u2019s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There\\u2019s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it\\u2019s her because her face doesn\\u2019t really change. She\\u2019s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I\\u2019d never heard of this woman before. I\\u2019m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn\\u2019t aware of. We just pass the day looking through all these generations of mostly women in the photographs. It was lovely.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Plant Hanger\\u201d It\\u2019s something like a conference, but more like a festival. I don\\u2019t know many people in it and I feel lost. I\\u2019m grateful to see that my sister-in-law is there, so we group together. She accompanies me as I move from place to place among the throngs of people. When it\\u2019s over, we stop somewhere and pick up some kind of plant. Then, I meet my friend, Michelle. She invites me back to her apartment. But my sister-in-law doesn\\u2019t come. She says she has somewhere else to go. The apartment is located on the upper floor, above a store. It\\u2019s on a very busy street in a city. I\\u2019ve been in this city before in a dream - this is the street where I saw my grandmother coming out of one of the shops. We go up the stairs to the side of the shop entrance and down a very small hall into her apartment. The kitchen is off to the left, the living/dining room is straight ahead, like an L-shaped room around the kitchen, and off to the left is the bathroom and two bedrooms. We sit down on the couch in the living room for a few moments. Her young son is there. I\\u2019ve never seen him in person before. I\\u2019m watching him play. Then, Michelle says to me: would I take a look at her plant window and help her to move all the plants in front of that window and get them hung in that place because they\\u2019re dying. So we go down to the bedroom and she shows me the window. The light that is shining through is radiant and it dazzles my eyes. I can\\u2019t even look at the window because the light is so bright. So I stand to the side of it and turn my head toward it and look that way. I see that there\\u2019s actually a sheer curtain hanging from a rod in front of the window. I didn\\u2019t notice it before because the light coming through was so dazzling. There are two plants hanging from the curtain rod. The ceiling is really high. While I\\u2019m looking at this and strategizing and thinking, hmm, how are we going to do this, she comes in and has this big vase, about 2 feet long and with mosaic on it. The colors are brilliant, mostly purple with some black, but the paint is peeling. She said: \\u201cI wonder about putting this in here, too.\\u201d As soon as she sets it down, there's some kind of reaction with the light coming through the window. All of a sudden you can see a whole lot more detail in the painting on it. But because the light is so brilliant, you can\\u2019t tell it was cracked before. I say, \\u201cOh yes, definitely bring that in here and put it in front of the window.\\u201d As she did that, everything else in the room lit up with an internal radiance of its own. So I say to her: \\u201cThat is one really high ceiling and I can\\u2019t imagine your husband having to put 16 plant hooks in the ceiling. Do you even have a ladder? So it might be better to just put 2 hooks in and we\\u2019ll hang 2 wooden dowels across, then hang the plants from those. We can stagger them. I\\u2019ve done this before in my own place.\\u201d So she agrees, then needs to go back to tend her son. So I take some measurements. Now I have in my bag, big spools of twine that I\\u2019m going to cut and start weaving into plant hangers, like macrame. So I go back out into the living room after taking the measurements and she says: \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have tea first? I\\u2019ve made some homemade cookies.\\u201d I do that and again we\\u2019re watching her son play. We can't really have a conversation because every time we start one, her son comes up with a toy and starts talking and suspends the conversation. Then she asks if I\\u2019ll watch him while she goes into the washroom. I say, \\u201cSure.\\u201d So I\\u2019m talking to him and lying on the floor. He\\u2019s moving trucks around or something. He hands me this toy and I notice that it\\u2019s got a plunger on the inside that you pull out then push - like a big plastic version of a gun. It was red and yellow with all these other floating pieces of color on the inside. I accidentally push the plunger and it squirts him in the eye with water. He lies down on the floor as though I\\u2019ve hit him. I understand that I\\u2019ve accidentally started playing with him with this squirt thing and I didn\\u2019t mean to squirt water in their house. So I get up and put it on the counter in the kitchen. While I\\u2019m doing this, Michelle comes out of the bathroom and she picks her son up and puts him on her hip and follows me into the kitchen. She\\u2019s doing something with one hand while she\\u2019s holding him with the other. I notice that there\\u2019s so much noise. I look over and see that there\\u2019s two televisions on and they\\u2019re both playing something different. I ask her if I can turn one of them off. She says yes, so I do. Then she says, \\u201cWhile you\\u2019re there, turn the other one off, too.\\u201d I look at it and don\\u2019t understand how. There\\u2019s a labyrinth of buttons and I don't see anything that\\u2019s obvious with a power switch. She says it\\u2019s the fourth one down from the top. So I push it, but the buttons are really small and my fingers are big. I accidentally push the second button first, and the television reacts and some other things happen simultaneously. She sighs, exasperatedly and comes over and turns it off herself. She sets her son down on the floor in the living room again with the toys, and says, \\u201cI need to go back in the bathroom again.\\u201d So I sit down with him. While I\\u2019m doing this, her husband comes in. I\\u2019ve never met him before. He\\u2019s surprised to see me. He sets down his suitcases, then asks if I know where the cookies are. I say, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re in the kitchen.\\u201d So he goes in there. His son is still playing, but now he\\u2019s making utterances and they\\u2019re really deep. I notice that he has a really deep voice. I\\u2019m trying to decipher what he\\u2019s saying. Now the dad is in the kitchen and he\\u2019s talking. I can\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s saying, but I notice that his voice is deep, too, and think to myself: \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s where the son gets his deep voice from.\\u201d Then Michelle comes out of the bathroom and she goes into the kitchen to talk to her husband and says something about there being three different kinds of cookies. She\\u2019s trying to get him to take one certain kind, but he\\u2019s ignoring her and piling up a plate of three different kinds and starts to eat them. Now I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable because I\\u2019m in their family dynamic and I don\\u2019t wish to be. I just want to make the macrame hangers for the plants. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Pool\\u201d I\\u2019m in a building that is several stories high. I never go outside of the building. I can just sense that I'm that far off the ground. There\\u2019s a lot of light coming in through windows in the ceiling; there aren\\u2019t any windows on the sides. Sometimes the light is so bright it hurts my eyes. At other times it\\u2019s just a presence. There are two pools in the building and they\\u2019re separated by a wall. They aren\\u2019t artificial pools. They look like natural pools insofar as if no one is in the water, the organic material will settle down to the bottom and you\\u2019ll be able to see it through the water. One of the pools is more often this way. The other one is muddy and the water does not look appealing to swim in at all. There is an army of guards surrounding both pools. They are vicious, mean, and I feel like they are alien as well. They are heartless, robotic. They\\u2019re in charge of us. They make judgments against us. Then they force us into the pools where depending on how we react, determines whether we will live or die. I see Debra and Omar. Both Debra and I are concerned about Omar as he seems to be getting the brunt of much maltreatment by these robotic guards. They\\u2019re pushing him around and poking him with things and they\\u2019re telling him he has this long list of wrongdoings. He\\u2019s going to be forced into the pool and killed. In fact, we know he is going to die this particular day. He has prepared for it in some way. Now there\\u2019s a little antechamber off the pools. We are sitting there talking to him. He\\u2019s telling us of his regrets. He\\u2019s also saying he\\u2019s in full knowledge of these and he\\u2019s voluntarily allowing them to treat him this way. He\\u2019s also explaining to us that going into the pool is part of the process and going voluntarily will make it better for him. So, this eases some of our tension and anxiety and sadness. Then it\\u2019s time for us all to leave the antechamber so we do. We go back out to the area around the pools. I notice that Omar has got metal boots - they look like the kind of boots that Roman soldiers would have worn. Now he\\u2019s also wearing the metal armor that they would have worn as well. Yet, he\\u2019s going to jump into the crystalline pool and I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s a really bad idea because it\\u2019s going to make him heavy; he\\u2019ll sink down to the bottom and then disturb all the dirt and organic material and it will turn into mud, and then they will judge him harshly. He does it anyway. I can feel the robotic guards start to surround us. One of them pushes me with their bayonet. I am forced into the pool as well. I\\u2019m trying not to move because I don\\u2019t want to stir up any of the silt from the bottom. Actually both of us do a really good job at keeping the pool water crystal clear. I swim to the end where it\\u2019s deeper. I find an opening where the people are not being treated as harshly and I get out and join them. Omar, however, is still in the pool. I'm not sure if he is going to be able to find an opening to get out. The guards are still really thick there and there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any escaping. The person beside me when I\\u2019m getting out says she\\u2019s been there for a really long time. Her hands are behind her back. They look like they\\u2019re tied, but I don\\u2019t think they are - I think she\\u2019s just standing like that. It makes it look as though we\\u2019re captives but really we\\u2019re starting to move more freely. So I do the same thing. I put my wrists together at the back of my body. I\\u2019m moving with the crowd. I\\u2019m slipping into the opening between the pools and I walk around the outside, allowing myself to be jostled by the people being pushed. But I\\u2019m actually not being pushed. I\\u2019m moving in and around the crowd. The constant moving is avoiding us being pushed to our deaths. This carries on for quite some time. I\\u2019m still looking to see if Omar is alive in the pool and he is. I can feel his life force starting to slip away and change into something else. I\\u2019m not hopeful that I will see him again alive and outside of the pool.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Professor\\u2019s Car\\u201d This dream begins and I have my friend's daughter with my extended family on vacation. She has a few special needs and I am caring for her. She\\u2019s a really sweet, innocent child. She is innocent to the extent that she will trust anyone. We go to a number of places on a roadtrip - it lasts a week. I feel like we might be somewhere on the Eastern seaboard of the states by the temperate climate and the vegetation and trees, as well as the hills. It is quite beautiful. We visit some scenic places as well as some historical places. My friend\\u2019s daughter is a pleasure to be with and explore with. My family begins to find an affection for her. At some time, both of my ears become sore and infected. I can\\u2019t hear anyone. I\\u2019m sleepy and I\\u2019m not feeling well. For the past two days of the vacation, I can\\u2019t wake up and I stay in the travel van. At one point I wake up and my stepmother has put cotton in my ears and I wasn\\u2019t even aware of it. Then when we get back to where we\\u2019re staying I still sleep. They ask if I\\u2019m okay. I say, \\u201cYes, I think I just need to sleep.\\u201d The vacation is over and now I return my friend\\u2019s daughter to him. When we get back to his place, he\\u2019s cleaned his apartment from top to bottom. He\\u2019s planted some beautiful plants in his bathroom - some look like cattails and bulrushes that are growing up from something in the floor around the toilet. The bicycles are all moved from the kitchen. I note that one of the bicycles is worth thousands of dollars. It\\u2019s got something for someone to sit on on the back of it, but the construction and design of it is so heavy that it takes two people to pedal it. So there is that provision. Where the bicycle chain and gears would be, there is a case overtop of it - to protect the inside of the legs of whoever is pedaling it. Then there\\u2019s another one of a different design, less expensive, more sporty for his son. So he says, \\u201cWould you mind waiting here just a little bit longer while I take these down to my garage space?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, sure.\\u201d So his daughter gets settled in her room and she\\u2019s happy to be home. She also doesn\\u2019t want me to leave. I tell her that I\\u2019ll see her again. My friend comes back up from putting the bicycles away and asks if I would like to see the car he has. I say, \\u201cI thought you didn\\u2019t have a car.\\u201d He said, \\u201cWell I did, I just couldn\\u2019t find it. But now that I\\u2019ve cleaned, I\\u2019ve got space for it and the bicycles.\\u201d I say sure. So he\\u2019s already removed it from the garage. The son stays with the daughter and my friend takes just me out for a ride. He says, \\u201cI thought you would enjoy this. I wanted to thank you for taking care of her for the week.\\u201d The car on the outside is a mint green. I notice the car\\u2019s age. It must be from the 1970s. It\\u2019s a Ford Metro. We get in and there\\u2019s chrome and teak on the inside. He presses a button and the dash expands upwards. It\\u2019s just beautiful. Everything is made of wood - the dashboard, it wraps around the driver\\u2019s side, the passenger\\u2019s side, goes all the way to the backseat; it\\u2019s on the inside panels of both doors and looks hand carved. There are these different controls. The steering wheel is a combination of teak and chrome as well. He\\u2019s pressing buttons and starting things. The car starts to take off and it feels like it\\u2019s gliding over the road. I also notice that we\\u2019re going at a fair speed and it\\u2019s not rattling or shaking. I comment to him that it\\u2019s really impressive how it drives. I say, \\u201cHow is it possible that you have a car this old and this good of shape?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I hardly ever drive it. It doesn\\u2019t have very much mileage on it.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really preserved it. This is exceptional.\\u201d We stop at an ice cream place. Here, I stand still. There\\u2019s an outdoor table, like the kind that comes up to your chest. It\\u2019s got a small round dias on the top. I\\u2019m doing something here with my ears. I need to take the packing out, putting it in plastic and throwing it away and replacing it. I have privacy. While I\\u2019m doing this, 2 or 3 young women (not teenagers, maybe early twenties) are grouped around the car and he\\u2019s talking to them. So I linger a little longer over my task. Then they walk off. But he\\u2019s still talking. So he directs what he was saying to me. I catch the last two or three words, but they\\u2019re muffled. He says, \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t listening to anything I was saying, were you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I am. But I couldn\\u2019t hear what you said first. I was way over there. My ears are really sore and I just can\\u2019t hear. Would you mind repeating it? Is it about the car?\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t and he\\u2019s a bit peeved that I didn\\u2019t listen. So we both go into the store. It\\u2019s just a regular gas station. I don\\u2019t need anything, so just linger around the doorfront. He picks up a few things and we get back into the car. We drive a little further. I\\u2019m asking him about the car. We return to his house. I get out before he parks the car in the underground garage and go back up to the apartment. Then I just give his daughter a hug. By that time my friend has re-entered. He thanks me again and I just say, \\u201cSee you later, \\u201c and leave. Then I walk back from his apartment to the house I\\u2019m temporarily sharing with my extended family. Now, I\\u2019m working in some kind of school, preparing lessons. While I\\u2019m in the building, I notice my friend\\u2019s daughter. She\\u2019s attending the school. I\\u2019m concerned about the treatment she receives from the other teachers. I suspect that one of the other teachers may be harsh with her. I\\u2019m trying to figure out if this is true. I\\u2019m keeping an eye on these things. The other teacher I\\u2019m suspecting is an older woman. She\\u2019s wearing a plain simple dress. She looks like Jane Eyre. At one point, one of the students or an assistant of sorts, is helping my friend\\u2019s daughter in the washroom. When they are finished, I say, \\u201cExcuse me. Do you mind? I just need to talk to you for a second.\\u201d She is acting hedgy and fidgety. She doesn't want to stand too close. I\\u2019m saying to her: \\u201cThis is important. I would appreciate it if you would give me your full attention and stand still.\\u201d So she does for two seconds. Then she starts looking around again. I say, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re uncomfortable with this, we can make an appointment. But I thought we could just talk here for a second and then you can be on your way. Is there somewhere you need to go?\\u201d She says no. I say, \\u201cWell , are you able to stand here for a few minutes?\\u201d I can\\u2019t figure out why she\\u2019s fidgeting. I\\u2019m wondering if she needs to use the washroom. I ask, \\u201cIs there somewhere else you need to go?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m just not supposed to be talking to you.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh this is weird.\\u201d She is the assistant for the teacher that I think might be being abusive and she\\u2019s been instructed not to talk to me. I think this is significant. Then I tell her about my rank in the school and she needs to sit there and listen to me because I\\u2019m starting to feel like the other teacher has her assistant covering for her. Now I\\u2019m really suspecting that she is as abusive as I think she is. So I pull rank. The student stands still. I read her something and tell her it is part of her job, it is her responsibility and she signed a paper to report any abuses or marks on the students that she sees. If she does not report it immediately, she is also subject to the abuse. So I can see her face as I\\u2019m reading this. Now she is paying attention. Her eyes widen and I think she knows something. So I tell her that I\\u2019m going to be watching her. Then she leaves, looking alarmed. Then my friend\\u2019s daughter is still in the washroom. I go in and check her, but she doesn\\u2019t have any marks on her. I tell her that If anything happens, she is to come see me right away and I\\u2019ll take her home to her dad.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Protective Glasses\\u201d I go back to the same theatre. This time I\\u2019m with my daughter. We\\u2019re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I\\u2019m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There\\u2019s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There\\u2019s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they\\u2019re closing them and stuff, but we\\u2019re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we\\u2019re standing there and we\\u2019re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don\\u2019t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: \\u201cWhat are those glasses you\\u2019re wearing? Are they protective somehow?\\u201d She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHmm, wow, maybe they do work,\\u201d kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there\\u2019s an indoor pool. It\\u2019s the same thing where we\\u2019re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you\\u2019re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it\\u2019s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they\\u2019re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don\\u2019t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can\\u2019t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher\\u2019s attention and say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s in there, she\\u2019s in the pool.\\u201d I go back outside so I\\u2019m behind the glass and I\\u2019m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I\\u2019m scanning the water, there\\u2019s no daughter. I\\u2019m starting to get scared and thinking, \\u201cAre they so busy testing everyone that they\\u2019re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?\\u201d I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to be in here! You can\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for my daughter! She\\u2019s underneath the water. She\\u2019s not surfacing.\\u201d They look and she\\u2019s not in there. Now I\\u2019m really scared, like, \\u201cWhat the heck? Where is she?\\u201d The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She\\u2019s definitely not in the pool. We\\u2019re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I\\u2019m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She\\u2019s coming from the back of the pool. They\\u2019re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?\\u201d She says, \\u201c Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.\\u201d I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I\\u2019m upset with her.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Race\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house with a couple of rooms. The rooms are spacious. There\\u2019s a dining room with some kind of chandelier in the middle of it. There\\u2019s a foyer between the dining room and living room. The foyer has a door that goes to the outside. The living room is also spacious with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The foyer that joins these two rooms is quite large with some furniture in it as well. I\\u2019m with another woman and two men. The other woman and the man have a relationship together. At the beginning of the dream I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re off in the shadows. I have a new relationship with the man that I can see. He\\u2019s white and has dark brown hair. I can see his features, they\\u2019re a little angular and pointy. He\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am and slim. We\\u2019re just getting to know each other. We talk somewhat. I have a feeling I\\u2019ve been set up with him but I don\\u2019t feel any energy with him and he\\u2019s a stranger. We do start talking. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing together really, but we move around the rooms and talk in different areas. I can feel myself starting to warm toward him. He can be interesting. I am starting to like him. The woman and the other man come out of the shadowy part of the dream. The man starts to talk to the man I was with. The woman approaches me and asks if we want to leave to go out for the day. We\\u2019ve both separately agreed that we do. The vehicles are motorcycles. The man I\\u2019m supposed to ride with seems to be recovering from some kind of injury and his buddy is asking him about the injury. He tells him that he thinks it\\u2019s going to be okay. Now I look and see him flexing and extending his leg at the knee. He says, \\u201cSee look, everything seems to be fine.\\u201d So, we put chaps over our legs and put on heavier coats. We go outside, get on the motorcycles and tour around for a little bit, then come back. We come back in. I'm involved in some meal preparation, as is the other woman. The two men are also doing things to help prepare. Then we have a meal on the table. We share the meal, all four of us. The other two recede into the shadowy part of the dream and leave me with the man I was speaking with and riding with all day. Now I can feel the pulse of a growing sexual energy between us. We explore this for a bit. We\\u2019re in the foyer when we\\u2019re doing this. The other man interrupts us and tells my partner that he needs to come out and look out the living room window and see what\\u2019s going on. My partner and I separate. The two men go into the living room. I\\u2019m tidying up and getting dressed. I see that there are a number of vehicles on the other side of the street, different models of Jeep from the more rugged safari type to the SUV type. Each one has a driver that has gotten out and they\\u2019re kind of congregating on the shoulder of the road. I can see also that some of them have been injured. The men are clapping each other on the back warmly like, \\u201cYou did it!\\u201d Others are rotating one shoulder up and back and bending elbows as though the shoulder and elbow have been injured but are now starting to heal. I notice that it\\u2019s a sunny day now whereas previously very little light was coming in the windows and it was semi-dark. This living room is very bright now. We\\u2019ve got a great big long console tv like the kind people would have in the 1960s that sits in a big wooden box. They\\u2019re starting to gather around to watch a big race. Some of the men that are coming in are quite elderly; whereas the man I was sharing energy with is in his forties. It\\u2019s a variety of males. They\\u2019re finding seats in this giant living room on the couches lining the walls. They\\u2019re setting up to watch this race together and it seems to be a really big event. I\\u2019m not interested in it, but I am interested in what\\u2019s going on in the backyard. I walk out. The living room exits into a greenhouse, like a sunroom, which then exits out into the backyard. I realize I\\u2019m in my grandparents\\u2019 house on the north shore and I have been all along. I\\u2019m looking for the rose bushes. All the gardens are only at the beginning with shoots, like the beginning of spring after a long winter. I\\u2019m just going from garden to garden to see what\\u2019s coming up. I go back into the house. I see the woman\\u2019s features now and it\\u2019s my stepmother. I tell her that there are some things coming up in the garden. She then just recedes into the kitchen. I check on the men in the living room and they\\u2019re still watching the NASCAR races. Then I notice that someone recently has cut roses and put them in vases in the sunroom. The roses are this deep pinkish red in the middle with light green petals around the outside. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat an unusual rose,\\u201d and I wonder who cut them and from which bush. I go back outside. Now it\\u2019s like the beginning of summer and everything has bloomed. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and I look down the length of the lawn. I can see the top of the boathouse and it has grass on it. I want to go lie there because I want to feel the waves and hear them under my body and soak up the sun. I go around to the side of the house first to see if the red and green roses came from there. No rose bushes there. There\\u2019s some kind of gardening shelf, just a little bench made of painted white wicker, with a small cupboard underneath. I open it up to see if I can find gardening tools. Somebody has already opened it and there\\u2019s a pair of gardening gloves and some shears and a couple containers sitting on the top of the bench. I wonder who has been wearing them and if it\\u2019s the person who has been cutting the roses and putting them around the house. I go a little farther and see that one of the plants is a Rose of Sharon but it\\u2019s not in bud yet. Then I decide to stop looking around the other side of the house and walk down the length of the lawn to lie in the sun for a little while. Then I can hear people talking, the doors opening, and people starting to leave. I know the race is over. I stand up and walk back towards the little bench to see if the gloves and shears are still there. I\\u2019m going to try and find some roses because I want to put some in my own room. My stepmother comes out and says, \\u201cYou really like it here, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s beautiful. Can we stay for a while?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think so.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good. There\\u2019s so much space. It\\u2019s nice not to have to squish myself into a room or turn my body sideways to get into a closet or out of a door.\\u201d She agrees. I say, \\u201cEven if I had a brand new house, they only make the bedrooms nine by nine now. I really like having a big bedroom.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, we can stay for a little while.\\u201d Then she recedes again. I go back into the living room. My friend and his friend are the only ones that remain. His friend asks him to come out for another motorcycle ride. My friend asks if I\\u2019d like to come and I say, \\u201cYeah, I would.\\u201d We get our motorcycle clothing back on and get on the bikes.\\u201d We\\u2019re driving down the highway. It goes around a bend and something I\\u2019m carrying, I think it\\u2019s a roll with a change of clothes in it, flies off the bike and I can see it beside the road. We don\\u2019t stop until we come to an outdoor cafe. I can feel that my right eye has tears in it that have been running down my face, but my left eye is dry. The friend of my friend says, \\u201cI wondered if you were ever going to express any of your grief. I can\\u2019t believe you haven\\u2019t done it until now.\\u201d I tell him that I was, he just couldn\\u2019t see it. He says, \\u201cHmm,\\u201d as though he doesn\\u2019t believe me, and then says, \\u201cWe should go back to the corner and get what you lost.\\u201d I agree and let them take me there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Reunion\\u201d I\\u2019m invited to some kind of gathering, I don\\u2019t know what the purpose is, except that I feel I should go. I have a little hesitancy about this because it\\u2019s enough of a drive for me that I\\u2019m thinking that by the time I get there, I\\u2019m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I\\u2019m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there\\u2019s a bottle of wine - there\\u2019s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I\\u2019ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I\\u2019ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don\\u2019t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there\\u2019s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar\\u2019s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He\\u2019s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, \\u201cit\\u2019s been a long time.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes it has.\\u201d We sit down next to each other and we\\u2019re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we\\u2019re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I\\u2019m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don\\u2019t know. So I\\u2019m not very happy about this. She\\u2019s apparently acting as though she\\u2019s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She\\u2019s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there\\u2019s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven\\u2019t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself from the table and go find my bags and give them to the hostess. When I get back from doing that though, more people have left their seats. I\\u2019m kind of relieved. I didn\\u2019t eat very much, but at least I\\u2019m not stranded in this awkward and ingenuous conversation with the woman. I realize that there\\u2019s been a gift for each of the people at their seats. They didn\\u2019t even notice it. The hostess is a little bit distressed about this - the fact that no one brought anything with them and that no one has noticed that there\\u2019s gifts at the table for each of them, and furthermore that people came and brought their toddlers and kids and left them unsupervised running all over the house. Basically what\\u2019s happened is the guests have been quite oblivious as guests and taken way more latitude than was offered and the house is trashed. Everything is everywhere. The guests have all left. They haven\\u2019t even taken their plates from the table. It\\u2019s just a mess. So I just start cleaning up. I\\u2019m helping by clearing the table and doing dishes. I make a point of thanking the hostess for my gift, which is a pair of silver candleholders that are like the Kokopeli character and they look like they were fashioned in Mexico. I thank her for her thoughtfulness. There\\u2019s also a gingerbread kit where the pieces of gingerbread are wrapped up in saran wrap. You would make your own icing and put them together. It\\u2019s a little mini house. As I\\u2019m thanking her, she\\u2019s enough upset that no one else did, that my words kind of fall around her like they\\u2019re unprocessed by her. She goes down into the basement. I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing down there. I am still cleaning upstairs. I continue helping with the dishes. There are a couple other of her family members - her two kids are helping. The dishes basically get done, but it takes a little while. I go into another room where the toddlers have trashed it. Omar is there. We gaze at each other. I feel his eyes. He beckons to me. He wants me to lie down with him. I say, \\u201cNo, I can\\u2019t do that. There are people and toddlers and stuff here.\\u201d We go upstairs. He\\u2019s cleaning, too, that\\u2019s what he was doing in the other room. We go upstairs and these kids have taken all the clothes out of the dresser. As I\\u2019m picking and folding clothes up, there\\u2019s a dirty diaper on the floor. We are tidying all of this up and trying to make their house right.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Road Trip\\u201d This dream begins with me in a car. My lover is in the backseat and a mutual friend is driving. We\\u2019re about to embark on a road trip. We drive by my kids\\u2019 school first. I want to check and make sure that they both leave and are on their way home to where they will be taken care of. So as we drive by, first I see my son. I wave to him. He waves back and walks in the direction of home. I know he\\u2019ll be fine. Then I see a whole lot of other kids - you know how kids at dismissal time come out in a pack, there may be a few stragglers at first and a few stragglers after the bulk of kids leaving. So we drive slowly. The bulk of kids is gone. I say, \\u201cHang on, I haven\\u2019t seen my daughter yet.\\u201d A few more kids come out of the school, then I see her. I wave and she waves me over. So I get out of the car and walk over right to her. She says, \\u201cMom, I have something you\\u2019ll need.\\u201d She hands me this really long sanitary napkin that has a tail at each end. She says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to need this.\\u201d Then I realize I do need it. But I don't know how to attach it to my body. I go into the school bathroom and I put it inside my underwear. But these tails are so long and I\\u2019m trying to fold them in so they don\\u2019t stick out. I\\u2019m worried it\\u2019s going to travel. It feels uncomfortable and bulky between my legs, and I don\\u2019t like it. However, it needs to collect blood and I feel myself bleeding. I walk back out thes school, give her a hug and she goes in the same direction as my son. I get into the car. Now I\\u2019m uncomfortable and some of the excitement of the road trip has been replaced by the anxiety of this uncomfortable, bulky and insecure thing between my legs. However, I continue on down through the road. The scenery is flat. You can see a lot - miles and miles of flat. There\\u2019s a little bit of steppe at the horizon. We drive for a long period of time until we run out of gas. We pull into a gas station. While my friends are tending to the car, I go into the washroom. I check to make sure that this napkin is still where it\\u2019s supposed to be and it is. I\\u2019m still concerned about these tails. Now I\\u2019m wearing overalls and the back part goes way down past my waist. I look in the mirror and I can see the top bit of my underwear sticking up. I think to myself,\\u201dWow, my underwear is really high today. Or is this going down really low?\\u201d I\\u2019m not really minding that, except that I\\u2019m worried about these tails. So I reach in behind and I tuck them down in again and I want to make sure that no one can see them. I get back into the car and we are driving again. The flat landscape starts to turn into what looks like a town. My friend, the driver, says, \\u201cWe\\u2019re almost at the theatre.\\u201d So we take a few more turns, get deeper into the town with more city scape. It\\u2019s quite old. The architecture, although I\\u2019ve never been there, looks Austrian - like a Hapsburg theatre would\\u2019ve looked like. It\\u2019s beautiful, intricate architecture. We park the car and walk in. The theatre has a giant arched doorway and as soon as you walk in, it\\u2019s got a hush where the soundproofing is perfect - you can\\u2019t hear any of the outside world. We walk down the carpet and we sit in the seats. I can feel the springs are perfectly loaded to absorb some of your body and they\\u2019re all cushioned so you don\\u2019t feel the spring itself. It just feels like you\\u2019re sinking into this hushed luxury. It\\u2019s a play. I don\\u2019t see any of the play in my dream. As soon as it\\u2019s supposed to start - the orchestra hasn\\u2019t even started yet - the dream shifts. The play is over. We\\u2019re instantly back in the car. Now I want them to stop at a gas station again because I need a different way of collecting the blood. They oblige. I don't tell them what for, I just ask them to stop at a certain place. I go in and I collect something that\\u2019s much more suited to my needs, go back into the washroom and get rid of the thing in the compartment designated for this kind of waste material. I put on something a lot more sleek and comfortable for me and securely attached. I get back in the car and we drive back through this same landscape. The driver drops my lover and I off at my door of my house. I go in. My son has fallen asleep in the living room on the couch. My daughter is upstairs in her room. So, my lover and I sit on the other couch. He falls asleep instantly. I have a cat now on my lap and am cat-paralyzed. I think, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s nothing to do here for a moment, so I\\u2019m going to look and see if there\\u2019s anything on tv.\\u201d I look down and there\\u2019s two things that interest me. One is a show about aliens, but history. Another is about this magical realm. The title is in Spanish: Tiende. I choose one of them - I think it\\u2019s the Tiende one - and I turn on the tv and I watch for a little bit. But now I'm getting uncomfortable because I don\\u2019t want to keep sitting still. The cat jumps off my lap. I get up, go back into the washroom, wash myself, and tend to my physical needs. I\\u2019m still bleeding, so I tend to that. I go back to the couch and sit down. My lover stirs a little bit and he reaches for me and pulls me over. We engage in a long deeply passionate but slow kiss. I can feel how sleepy he is and I\\u2019m starting to get tired. So the kiss completes itself with some kind of acknowledgement that there is mutual sleep to follow. I go upstairs. He\\u2019s back asleep on the couch. I get into bed and then wonder if he\\u2019s going to get cold when he wakes up. There\\u2019s no blanket down there. So I go into the spare room, get one of the blankets to cover him with it. When I go back downstairs, he has removed all his clothing. I cover him up. He says to me, in Spanish, now that I have come down with a blanket he has taken his clothes off. He says, \\u201cComo?\\u201d Then he falls back to sleep. I go back upstairs and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Rose Farm\\u201d This dream begins in the house where I grew up. I\\u2019m in the kitchen waiting for a phone call. Some man is in the basement and he\\u2019s making something and periodically he comes upstairs. He\\u2019s wearing a toolbelt, he has a saw and he grabs some nails that are in a box on top of the fridge and goes back down with them. So, each time he trucks up and down the stairs, I\\u2019m aware that he has not finished making what he\\u2019s making down there. There\\u2019s a special delivery that comes to the front door. I answer it and bring it back to the table to open. It\\u2019s a package that was sent by a woman named Maureen that composes aerobics classes for GoodLife Fitness in Canada. It says I\\u2019m sorry for your loss and open it up and it\\u2019s this choreography for an aerobics class. However, it\\u2019s just the musical score. There\\u2019s no direction of what to put with it. There\\u2019s another person in the kitchen now and she\\u2019s someone that teaches this class. I show her the score and say, \\u201cUm, this is a nice gesture but how useful is it without the steps? There\\u2019s no choreography. It's only the music.\\u201d She looks at it with me and says, \\u201cHmmm,\\u201d and starts to listen to it and see if she can put steps to it. She gives up and says, \\u201cthis is impossible.\\u201d She sits down and then I look at it again. I realize that the beat is in things you can do in 8 and if you take 5 steps to the front, 1 to the side, 1 to the back and go back to where you started it does equal 8. So I\\u2019m starting to try to figure this out and then the phone rings. It\\u2019s Maureen from Good Life and she\\u2019s in a peppy aerobics instructor voice, \\u201cHi, this is Maureen! Did you get my package?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, I did, but I\\u2019m not quite sure what to do with it seeing there\\u2019s no choreography.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh well, there\\u2019s a word for that.\\u201d And I reply back, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s Word!\\u201d as a rapper would say it. There\\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone and she\\u2019s somewhat offended. The conversation ends. I go back into the kitchen, fully prepared to keep trying to figure this out for myself when the carpenter has completed this small box. He gives it to me and says, \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d As soon as I take the box in my hand, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m on this old farm. The farm has a sign in front of it and it\\u2019s called The Rose Farm. There\\u2019s a pump so you can pump the water up out of the ground. Everything is made of granite, which is a rock, and it\\u2019s faded pink. It really breathes history. The farm is strangely quiet, it\\u2019s almost like a museum. There\\u2019s no real activity going on in it. I go inside the farmhouse and there\\u2019s an old woman sitting there. My cat is with me. I say to her, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought something to comfort you.\\u201d I set the box down on the table. She\\u2019s sad. She looks up. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought my cat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think mine only has about an hour left.\\u201d Rather than seeing where her cat is lying, I see it as a vision in front of my eyes and it\\u2019s kind of suspended between the ground and the ceiling. The cat looks old - it looks like a 25 year old cat. Its fur is matted and its skin is emaciated away from its bones. The joints are big and round like arthritic. My cat is a lot younger, it\\u2019s black. It comes with me into the kitchen and my cat sits down beside me. We both wait there with her. Then I look at the wooden box I\\u2019ve set on the table and then I realize that it\\u2019s a coffin for her cat and she says, \\u201cThank you, I\\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here.\\u201d She takes the coffin and goes into the room and doesn't come back - neither one of them. And then my cat and I sit in the kitchen. I\\u2019m patting my cat and then the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe RV\\u201d I\\u2019m in an RV. It's kind of close quarters. There are at least three other people with me. We\\u2019re taking turns going to the back of the RV and using the washroom facilities. My belongings are in a suitcase tucked under the back bed and there is always something else on top of it or beside it, and always some waiting for someone else to get their things out first, so I can get to mine. It\\u2019s really cramped. Everything always seems rushed. I\\u2019m supposed to be hosting some kind of group discussion and I\\u2019ve been planning it for some time. There\\u2019s about twenty people involved and a certain day that it happens. In my dream, today is the day. I\\u2019m trying to use the washroom and get my clothes out, but there\\u2019s always someone else in there. I\\u2019m starting to feel rushed and I\\u2019m going to be late. I have this other book satchel that I brought on the trip and it had all the things I needed for the group discussion. It was all organized and I put it in there before the trip. There were pens I needed and a little tiny laptop and paper and a couple of other things that look like slim books, and they all fit in there nicely. I can\\u2019t find this. Someone has moved this. I\\u2019m looking for the people in the RV to ask them: \\u201cWho moved my thing? Where did you put it? I need it and have to go now.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time to go and I can\\u2019t find it. So this lady named Maria says, \\u201cHere, I have a few pencils and a pad of paper you can use.\\u201d I notice that hers have her name on everything. Everything I\\u2019m using says Maria. I think that was a really good idea that she had. I thank her and exit out the RV. I go back behind it to a long building and I enter the building. There\\u2019s a big room like a studio room. People are already there and sitting and waiting. One of the people that signed up, before I can get to the place they\\u2019ve left empty for me, he sits down in it. I wonder what he\\u2019s doing. He opens this paperback book and starts reading these really cryptic sentences. I think, \\u201cWhat does that even mean? I can\\u2019t even recognize any part of that sentence as relating to the subject matter we\\u2019re gathered here for.\\u201d Now while I was happy to give him some time leading the group, because he was part of this group, I see everyone else is looking puzzled and it\\u2019s my responsibility to facilitate. I think I should redirect this somehow. So I quietly shuffle around the outside of the circle and come down on my hands and He holds up the cover and it\\u2019s some completely different book, completely different topic. So I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, well, I had something scheduled before this, but my group didn\\u2019t show up or they were late. So I thought I would just take this time to get my stuff in anyway,\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t really do anything about this without completely disrupting and if they\\u2019re listening, I\\u201dll just walk away.\\u201d So I do. I leave him there to talk about whatever he was trying to talk about with my group. I get halfway back to the RV and three of the other group members have also left and run up behind me. They say, \\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don't know. He just usurped my group and is using it for his own purposes.\\u201d They say, \\u201cWell, we came to hear you, so we\\u2019re not going back,\\u201d and they leave. I get to the RV and open up the door. Maria is sitting at the driver\\u2019s seat. I tell her, \\u201cThank you very much for your things. I didn\\u2019t need them. I really like the nametags. Where did you get them?\\u201d I tell her that Brad was taking over the group and say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t he one of your students?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, he is. He shouldn\\u2019t be doing that. I\\u2019m going to go see what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d She leaves the RV. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sandbox'' In this odd mix of imagery and people, I find myself in a large two-story house with various people that I know from my extended family and where I currently work. The dream begins with C.R. from work and she\\u2019s been given the responsibility of taking care of two babies - one is about 10 months, almost ready to walk but not ready walking independently, and one can\\u2019t be anymore than 9 months older, not even two and he\\u2019s male. Later on in the dream when I ask what the children\\u2019s names are, someone tells me that the younger one is named Stacey and the older one is Alexander. So she\\u2019s taking care of them and I see her bring the babies out of a room and wonder if maybe they\\u2019ve just been bathed because they\\u2019re naked. She lays the younger one down on the rug beside the railing. The older one is standing. She tells them to stay there while she goes into a different room and gets diapers. I\\u2019m coming out of another room and I see them there and think, \\u201cWhy is she laying them there? It\\u2019s really close to the stairs.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that the younger one can roll and fall down the stairs. I start to move towards that child and at the same time, she rolls and goes all the way down the stairs face first! I\\u2019m just horrified and thinking, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d She lands at the bottom and C.R. comes out of the room carrying the diapers, picks her up, and she\\u2019s okay! She carries her back upstairs and says, \\u201cHere can you hold her?\\u201d So, I do. I\\u2019m standing there with a naked baby on my hip. I\\u2019m looking at her and thinking, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you pee on me!\\u201d And that\\u2019s when I ask, \\u201cWhose children are these and what are their names?\\u201d Someone comes up to me and says the younger one is Stacey, the older one is Alexander. They belong to someone, but the name is muffled so I can\\u2019t understand what it is. That person isn\\u2019t there right now. Now the scenery that evolves around me is a kitchen. I\\u2019m standing there and there's people at the table. I see my stepmom\\u2019s brother and sister-in-law who\\u2019ve been very kind to me throughout my life. My aunt has a natal wheel in her hand and she says to me (I\\u2019m still holding this kid on my hip), \\u201cIs it possible that each year on my birthday, the aspects will move into a different house?\\u201d I reply to her and say, \\u201cYes, because they move one degree ahead each year. I say, \\u201cSo if you have any aspects that are in the 29th degree of something last year, then this year, they\\u2019ll be at the 30th degree, so it\\u2019s on the cusp. Or if they were on the 30th last year they\\u2019ll be in the first degree the next one, so they\\u2019ll be all the way in a different house. What have you got there?\\u201d She shows me her natal wheel and I say, \\u201cOh look, you\\u2019ve got something that\\u2019s just moved into this house, which is ruled by Libra.\\u201d So she\\u2019s studying her chart and she\\u2019s absorbed by this. Then the kitchen suddenly expands and there\\u2019s a long dining room like my grandparents used to have. There\\u2019s a long table that seats 14 or 18 people and it\\u2019s set for dinner and there's chairs and whatnot. People start carrying dishes that they\\u2019ve prepared in the kitchen and they\\u2019re setting them out on the table. I\\u2019m vaguely aware that this is my extended family and the gathering is because it\\u2019s my aunt\\u2019s birthday. But at the same time, the children have been picked up by whoever owns them and I\\u2019m no longer carrying the one on my hip. Then, there\\u2019s this wooden small sandbox beside me. It\\u2019s a square box and made of plywood. It has a divider in it in the middle that divides the sandbox into 4 equal parts filled with sand. Another friend that I\\u2019ve recently starting talking to more from the studio where I teach, Arizona, is walking up that same hallway where those two kids were laying and the one fell down the stairs. He sees me and comes up and says, \\u201cWhat do you think about the election?\\u201d I say, \\u201cJust like this sandbox here, we have the same people in the same demographics and no matter who is running, the outcome is going to be the same because the sand hasn\\u2019t changed from its compartments.\\u201d He says to me, \\u201cI think you\\u2019re wrong and I\\u2019ll tell you why.\\u201d By this time, he\\u2019s walked all the way up the hallway and is now standing beside me in the kitchen. I say, \\u201cWhy? What do you think?\\u201d I\\u2019m really curious and given the political climate we live in, I\\u2019m obviously really hopeful because I would like for it to change. I don\\u2019t want the same person to be elected - he\\u2019s a Trump kind of person, but he\\u2019s not called Trump in the dream. So he starts talking to me and I can\\u2019t hear what he\\u2019s saying and I really want to hear him. He\\u2019s tilting his head to the side and I\\u2019m tilting my head to the side so I can still hear him and all of a sudden we\\u2019re lying down in a bed and I\\u2019m leaning in to hear what he\\u2019s saying the way you would lean into kiss someone, but the other person\\u2019s mouth is by your ear. Then I take my leg and wrap it over top him. His hands are around my low back and he flips me over, so I\\u2019m on my back but his hands are still behind me and he starts stroking underneath my buttocks and around my yoni from behind. It sends a rush of pleasure all the way up my spine and it was so pronounced that I woke up. I never got to hear what he thought about the election.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scaffold\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of childcare setting. I\\u2019ve applied to work there. The dream opens up on what I think is my first day of work. So I walk into a classroom. There are maybe 13 to 15 kids and they look to be around an early school age, like 5 or 6 years old. There are two teachers attending them. As soon as I arrive in the room, they leave. I think, \\u201cWow, way to throw me into this.\\u201d But within a few minutes, another teacher comes in and she introduces herself. She tells me she's there to train me. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good then because that was my understanding.\\u201d She starts describing the curriculum to me and giving me a little bit of information about each child. I\\u2019m taking this in and feeling that sounds familiar, as I\\u2019ve worked in this kind of educational setting before. We start to collect what we\\u2019ve done with the kids up and tell them it\\u2019s time to put their things away and get ready to go outside for outdoor time. The kids start going out the door. There\\u2019s something out in the playground. It\\u2019s really, really large. It\\u2019s large enough that it\\u2019s leaving a shadow on the window of the classroom. I can\\u2019t see how high up it goes. It\\u2019s quite looming. There are some men on it who are working on it, too. It has the feel of one of those scaffolds that construction sites have where you climb up and up and up to work on something at the top. It\\u2019s a safe platform for people as opposed to a ladder, which is not very safe and kind of flimsy. So there are a few men on this and they\\u2019re busy with it. I do note (not in my dream, but after waking), one of the men is black. There are also some plants that are starting to overgrow the bottom of whatever structure this is. They\\u2019re moving from this structure into the building. So while the person who is training me is supervising the playground, I am trying to moveis plant that is starting to grow inside the door of the classroom. It feels really strong in my hands. When I pick it up, it\\u2019s like a vine and fits into the palm of my hand like a rope that\\u2019s about 1 inch in diameter. Every time I try to move it away from the door, it just grows back. I\\u2019m doing this the whole time during playground time. The teacher and kids start to come back in the room now because outdoor time is over. We\\u2019re setting up for the after outdoor time curriculum. I feel that I\\u2019m starting to get sick. So, I get a paper towel from the wall, put it over my mouth and I get sick into it. I notice that the vmit is all blood colored, although it\\u2019s not blood. It\\u2019s like food or something like food. Then I put it in the garbage. I start to do something else, I feel myself getting sick again, so same thing - paper towel off the wall, vomit, put it into the garbage. I go to the sink in the classroom. I wash my hands, I wash my face. I come back to what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I am facilitating an activity at one of the tables. I\\u2019m only doing that for a few minutes when I get sick again. So I\\u2019m trying to hide this now because it\\u2019s my first day on the job and I\\u2019m training. I just want to finish out the day. I\\u2019m not feeling overly sick in my body. It\\u2019s just that this keeps happening. I keep vomiting. I keep throwing the paper towel out and then I\\u2019m fine. So I\\u2019m doing this until there\\u2019s another woman who comes into the room. Now I notice that the classroom has two sides. The other side is completely empty. There is no curriculum going on there, no teachers, no students. When this other woman comes in, she says to me: \\u201cHow are you doing on your first day?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh fine, I\\u2019m completely comfortable with this.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s good because I hired you to run the senior school program in this other side of the building. We\\u2019ve lost our teacher and that\\u2019s really what I had earmarked for you.\\u201d I feel a little bit surprised about this because I thought I was going to be hired to team teach with someone and I was really looking forward to team teaching. But, if that\\u2019s the job, then I\\u2019m not going to turn it down. So I ask her how much longer I have for training. She says, \\u201cAnother week or two. You let me know when you\\u2019re comfortable.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell okay, that\\u2019s good then.\\u201d But as we\\u2019re talking, I feel another urge to be sick. So I take another paper towel off the wall and I\\u2019m 06sick into it. I surreptitiously wipe my mouth and put it in the garbage. I do this several times while she\\u2019s showing me around the empty classroom and describing what she wants to have go on in there. Then she looks at me and says, \\u201cAre you being sick?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, I am.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s interesting. You\\u2019re not the only person who has been sick here. We\\u2019ve lost several teachers to the same thing.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHuh, because to me it seems that every time I touch that plant, \\u201c and I indicate the one that keeps trying to overgrow through the door and into the windows, \\u201cI get sick after. I wasn\\u2019t sick before I got here.\\u201d I wasn't sick before I arrived.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scavenger Hunt\\u201d I\\u2019m in this outdoor space. It\\u2019s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It\\u2019s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they\\u2019re conifers. I don\\u2019t recall any deciduous trees at all. I\\u2019m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there\\u2019s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that\\u2019s hidden for the purpose that it\\u2019s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can\\u2019t see the marks unless you\\u2019re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don\\u2019t have any equipment. We\\u2019re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there\\u2019s some item that\\u2019s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There\\u2019s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What\\u2019s the natural food you do with fish food if there\\u2019s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I\\u2019m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it\\u2019s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it. Then it submerges itself. Right after that, an even bigger fish starts swimming up to the surface. It\\u2019s about twelve feet long! We all start running out. It\\u2019s the mother. There was only one piece of food and we\\u2019re thinking that we might be the other food. Each one of these spots has hazards and the thing you\\u2019re supposed to solve. Some people are able to remember three red dots and they just keep moving back. Other people can only remember one at a time so they go back down to the bottom of the hill and look through the night vision glass again. One of these times when I go back down there Omar is there. We group together to do our scavenger hunt. We have to go quite far. It\\u2019s a lot farther out than some of the ones that are closeby. There is a long climb up a tree then you have to move from the tree onto a rock cliff face. We swing onto the rock. There\\u2019s a forest ranger lookout tower and we climb up it. He finds all this survival equipment - tiny packages of dehydrated food wrapped in plastic and shirts with long sleeves individually wrapped in plastic. They\\u2019re the kind of shirt that protects you from the sun. There are other things also wrapped in plastic. Because he got there first, he has this big box. Luckily I was there, too, because it\\u2019s really impossible to hold a box and climb back down to the night vision pane of glass. So he hands me the box, then climbs down, then I hand him the box and climb down. This is how we get down. Once we get down, he is tasked with needing to divide the contents of the box equally between all the participants of this scavenger hunt. While he\\u2019s doing this, I go and find more of the marks. When I come back, he\\u2019s finished the task. Apparently, it\\u2019s my job to disperse the packages he\\u2019s divided and give one to each person. For some reason, he\\u2019s written really, really tiny and the ink of the pen he was using is really blotchy and runs out sometimes. It\\u2019s really hard to read the names. I\\u2019m trying to guess some of them. I do. I have another pen and am writing on the top trying to fill in the blanks. It starts to get dark. There\\u2019s one more task to finish. I go up the hill to a grassy area. There\\u2019s a lawnmower. Those two things go together. What do you do with a lawnmower? You cut grass. Only it\\u2019s really tricky because the grass is growing on the side of a slope and it\\u2019s pretty much a vertical rise. That\\u2019s the only long grass. I\\u2019m trying to push the lawnmower up and then guide it back down so it doesn\\u2019t flip over and cut my feet with the blade. I do this. It\\u2019s dark. This man comes over and comments that I\\u2019ve done a good job. The other tricky part about doing this is that there are some plants - angel\\u2019s trumpet - growing on that slope. You wouldn\\u2019t cut that with your lawnmower. So I have to be careful to get the grass without damaging the angel's trumpet. I finish this and then leave the lawnmower. At this point, there\\u2019s some kind of alarm raised. Everybody is running. There is some chaos. I see someone I know. I run over to her and ask if she knows what\\u2019s going on. She\\u2019s not sure and says I should stay here. This is one of the flat spots, a plateau. Others are gathering here, too. I see Omar and realize I didn\\u2019t finish dispersing all the survival kits. I can feel the fear in people as we\\u2019re standing and waiting to see if we have eased the threat by finding the marks and solving the puzzles, doing what we need to do? This question is just hanging in there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Shopping Mall\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large urban city. It\\u2019s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can\\u2019t identify where I am because of it. I\\u2019m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I\\u2019ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It\\u2019s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I\\u2019m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says \\u201cyou are here\\u201d and lists the index of all the stores, but I don\\u2019t see one. Because I\\u2019m still looking, I\\u2019m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren\\u2019t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they\\u2019re offering. They\\u2019re all specialty shops. Each store that\\u2019s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they\\u2019re not made of raincoat material or anything; they\\u2019re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they\\u2019ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there\\u2019s very little inventory offered in each. I think, \\u201cWow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.\\u201d Then I figure that whatever it is that they\\u2019re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what\\u2019s in the windows and note in a general way, \\u201cOh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I\\u2019m not even going to look at it.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Skyscraper\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the ground and I\\u2019m looking at a skyscraper. I can see that there are people on the very top of it - maybe three or four people. Just off the top, actually hanging over the edge a couple of feet down are two other people. There\\u2019s no scaffolding. They have a rappel line buckled in just below the belly. I don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s attached to, but it does seem to be attached to the building. They all look completely relaxed. I don\\u2019t know how I can see this from so far away. They look like silhouettes - the people are all black silhouettes, although it\\u2019s daytime. I can see the building is made of some kind of grey concrete. They\\u2019re waving - not even hanging on with both hands. Then suddenly I\\u2019m on top of the building. I can feel how windy it is up there. I feel kind of nervous. When I look over the edge to see who these two people were that were down there, I get really dizzy. My feet are both on the roof, but the sheer height of this skyscraper is massive - it\\u2019s fifty stories high. The dream is about the vertical and dizziness and just feeling it.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Songwriter\\u201d I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It\\u2019s like a small theatre, so it\\u2019s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they\\u2019re hosting a band. I don\\u2019t sit at one of the seats though, I\\u2019m standing at the back. I\\u2019m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I\\u2019m listening to the lyrics because I\\u2019m familiar with them. I\\u2019m really just wanting to enjoy how they\\u2019re paired with the melody. We\\u2019re about four songs in. He sings this one and it\\u2019s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I\\u2019m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn\\u2019t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight\\u2019s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I\\u2019m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he\\u2019s finished and, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to tell you about that song.\\u201d I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It\\u2019s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It\\u2019s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, \\u201cOh, where did this come from?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI found it in your friend\\u2019s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he\\u2019s dead.\\u201d It\\u2019s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn\\u2019t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn\\u2019t really grieved his friend\\u2019s death. That\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It\\u2019s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, \\u201cNo way, he wouldn\\u2019t have written this for me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.\\u201d I can see it\\u2019s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I\\u2019m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It\\u2019s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d How could there be any other result here other than he\\u2019s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?\\u201d He\\u2019s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he\\u2019s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, \\u201cThank you for showing me this.\\u201d We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sound\\u201d I\\u2019m on my way or coming from somewhere. I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven\\u2019t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We\\u2019re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It\\u2019s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can\\u2019t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they\\u2019re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it\\u2019s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they\\u2019re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn\\u2019t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, \\u201cYes, I know. I don\\u2019t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, are you coming for Trina\\u2019s fiftieth birthday?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t know about that, but maybe.\\u201d She writes the date down and tells me it\\u2019s going to be on April first. When she\\u2019s writing this down I say, \\u201cYou know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn\\u2019t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll put my phone number down here, too.\\u201d She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have yours either.\\u201d She gives me another piece of paper, it\\u2019s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I\\u2019m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it\\u2019s so small that there isn\\u2019t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, \\u201cHmm, there\\u2019s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d While she\\u2019s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I\\u2019m doing this, she says to me, \\u201cHave you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they\\u2019re trying to change things in this town.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow they must really have their work cut out for them because there\\u2019s so much dark horribleness in this place.\\u201d She\\u2019s telling me that there\\u2019s a movement against them coming in. I just say, \\u201cNo, I didn\\u2019t know about either one.\\u201d Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I\\u2019m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I\\u2019m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I\\u2019ve asked her for a drink of water which I\\u2019ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it\\u2019s windy and they\\u2019re blowing open. So I\\u2019m trying to pee as I\\u2019m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it\\u2019s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, \\u201cCome back anytime.\\u201d I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there\\u2019s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way. I just press his phone number to see if he\\u2019s home because I don\\u2019t want to go out there if he isn\\u2019t. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Stairs\\u201d I\\u2019m in kind of like an office building, that\\u2019s what it feels like. Everything is that institutional color, white or grey. There are a lot of windows but no design or creativity to the architecture, it\\u2019s just put together. The dream begins on the bottom floor. There is one couch and a whole bunch of boxes of clothes. I\\u2019ve brought one of them here with my daughter\\u2019s clothes from where she was four and five. I brought them because her godparents at the time, their daughter is three and most of the clothes have only been worn a couple of times so they look brand new, including this pair of white girls shoes that you put on for special occasions. She only had them on for one two-hour thing, it was a funeral, and I carried her for most of it. The godparents are looking through their daughter\\u2019s own clothes trying to find a pair of shoes. I tell them that there\\u2019s a pair that I brought in the box of clothes. The godmother says nothing and continues to look through the boxes of clothes as though I haven\\u2019t spoken. Her husband says, \\u201cOh thanks, that would be great! Where is the box that you brought?\\u201d I tell him, \\u201cI put it over there.\\u201d He goes that way and starts looking for it. In the meantime, I\\u2019m sitting on the couch with their daughter. She normally doesn\\u2019t laugh and I know this. She doesn\\u2019t express her emotions very well. I\\u2019m very careful not to pick her up and toss her around the way some adults do with the kids or disrespect her space. I just sit on the couch and if she wants to come over, she will. I look at her and talk to her. I notice that she has a really old face for a three year old. I find this compelling. I\\u2019m really paying attention because I think she has some wisdom that has perhaps been overlooked due to the fact that she\\u2019s in a three year old body. She eventually toddles over and sits on my lap. She\\u2019s facing me and she grabs my hands. You know how kids run up your body and then they somersault while they\\u2019re holding your hands? She does that. I\\u2019m a little surprised because I know she\\u2019s reputed to be standoffish; however, I\\u2019m quite familiar with this move so we do it. After the second one she starts to laugh and her parents look at me with some surprise. The mom looks annoyed and comes over and tries to grab her, but she says no to her mom and does the somersaults a few more times and is laughing. By this time, I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I ask the child if it\\u2019s okay if I set her down on the couch. She says she doesn\\u2019t want me to do that. I say, \\u201cOkay, how \\u2018bout we stand up and help look in the boxes?\\u201d She agrees to do this but wants to be carried. I shift her so she\\u2019s balanced on my left hip. We walk towards her dad who finds the shoes at that moment. He says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s get you dressed.\\u201d I give her to her dad. Now I\\u2019m on some kind of rescue mission and am supposed to go up to the top floor of the building. I walk over to the stairwell. It\\u2019s like if you look at stairs from the side of the building and you can see that there\\u2019s a forty-five degree angle going up and then another one going up, and you can see all these angles, but you can also see the ones going down as if you\\u2019re right beside it and seeing through the glass. They look like this when I\\u2019m trying to go up them. The down-going stairs are mixed in with the up-going stairs. The first time, it\\u2019s quite clear to me and I can see the up-going stairs anyway. I go to the top floor where I\\u2019m supposed to be. There\\u2019s a woman and I have an appointment with her. I make it for the appointment. She talks to me but I don\\u2019t remember what we say to each other. She gives me some kind of assignment that I\\u2019m responsible for. I take it. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s something physical; it\\u2019s something in my mind. I accept it. I go back down the stairs. I realize that I have a question that I\\u2019m uncertain about. As soon as I get to the bottom I want to go back up the stairs. I do one flight and then the down-going stairs exerts itself in front of me. I go down one flight anyway because I have to in order to access the up-going stairs. But the access for the up-going stairs isn\\u2019t there, so I go down one more flight thinking I\\u2019ll find it but I don\\u2019t. Now I\\u2019m feeling concerned because I\\u2019ve gone down two flights of stairs and I don\\u2019t want to be down here. I see the door open and it\\u2019s really dark where that person has come from - it\\u2019s like an underground parking lot with that creepy kind of feel to it. I think if I watch what they\\u2019re doing then I can find the up-going stairs. But they\\u2019re running really quickly. I can hear their footsteps going up but I can\\u2019t see what path they\\u2019ve taken. I follow the up-going stairs anyway. It takes me back up the two flights that I mistakenly descended. Then I\\u2019m trying to continue going up back to the offices but the down-going stairs keeps mixing up. This time I\\u2019m smarter and I don\\u2019t take the down-going flights, I just keep trying to find the up-going ones. After a little while I realize I can\\u2019t and think I\\u2019ll have to go on the mission anyway with these questions in my mind.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Studio\\u201d I\\u2019m at the studio where I teach. It\\u2019s set up differently, though. The front of the building extends way out into the street and instead of just having a glass front, three of the sides are glass so it\\u2019s a lot more transparent and visible to people walking by. Before it always felt like a sanctuary with natural brick walls and the glass front and wood floors. In this dream it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. I\\u2019m standing at the front desk which is a lot bigger. One of the owners is there. The back hallway that normally leads into the studio is now a back entrance, so people are coming in the back entrance as well. There\\u2019s more than one studio now with two doors. I see my ex-husband and a bunch of his high school friends. They\\u2019re walking like a clump of high school age guys, pushing each other playfully and stuff like that. They walk in without checking in at the desk because they\\u2019re all self-absorbed. They just go down the hall into the studio. The owner is trying to piece together their names and check off their memberships for them. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh great, they\\u2019re going to be in my class that I\\u2019m about to teach in a half hour.\\u201d I\\u2019m mentally rearranging my sequence so I can make it more physical because guys that age need that in order to focus and be present. So I\\u2019m just standing there in my head for a few minutes. Then a bunch of people come in through the back behind me. They\\u2019re also really loud. I don\\u2019t get to finish processing how I\\u2019m going to change my class in my head. They\\u2019re asking questions about the kids class. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cKids class? We don\\u2019t have kids yoga.\\u201d My answer surprised them a little. They're talking amongst themselves. I look at the time and see that it\\u2019s time for me to teach my class. I go across to the hall and am starting my music. I go into the door and instead of a whole bunch of people lying on their mats, there\\u2019s a teacher from the jujitsu studio standing at the front and a whole bunch of eight year olds. I notice the room is really hot not because it\\u2019s a hot class but because there\\u2019s been so much body heat in there working really hard. It hits me like a wall when I open the door. I go back to the desk and say to the owner: \\u201cDo we have kids yoga?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t reply. She\\u2019s already engaging with the group that had come in from the back and discussing the kids yoga with them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, hmm, I guess they do.\\u201d Then I wait for her to finish her conversation with them. I say, \\u201cI don't know where my class is. The room is full of other people and kids.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh they\\u2019re supposed to have finished five minutes ago.\\u201d I go back to the door and this time they see me because I\\u2019m standing with the door open. The teacher says, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll just be five more minutes.\\u201d I open the door fully and turn to look at the back of the room. I see my whole class practically sitting on top of each other. They don\\u2019t have their mats rolled out. My ex-husband is there with his gang. They\\u2019re all wrestling, piled on top of each other. Now it\\u2019s fifteen minutes past the time I was supposed to teach. I go back out to the desk. I tell the studio owner that it\\u2019s disrespectful to not follow the guidelines when you\\u2019re supposed to start and stop a class. She sighs, kind of dejectedly. Then we start talking about an energy exchange. She says, \\u201cWe both need it. I can give you a hot stone massage and I\\u2019m really in need of a thai massage.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that sounds like a really good idea.\\u201d We don\\u2019t deal with the problem of the room stuffed with people. The dream skips over and we\\u2019re trying to set up one of the rooms in the back hallway for the energy exchange. But as soon as we get into the room, the group of kids yoga is exiting and they\\u2019re all over the place. I realize I have to go into teach and say, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m sorry, I can\\u2019t actually do the energy exchange, I have to go teach.\\u201d I go into teach. The group changed all the playlist around so I\\u2019m trying to figure out where mine is because now it\\u2019s playing hard rock. I do that. I put the quiet song on. I do manage to get everyone onto their mats and I start to teach my class. The dream blips. I don\\u2019t remember teaching the entirety of my class. When I come back out to the desk, the studio owner tells me she can\\u2019t do the energy exchange because she has a baseball game to go to now. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ask you to come all the way in on a Saturday for this.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she\\u2019s being kind of passive aggressive about this because her tone of voice and body language imply that she does want me to come in on a Saturday for this. I think I don't. I say, \\u201cWell is there any other Monday that you would be available? I could come in a little earlier before I teach.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, I have baseball on all of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she obviously knew that when we talked about an energy exchange so she really did mean to exchange on a Saturday. I decline the Saturday and leave the building. I start trudging through the stone and guess I\\u2019m going home. I get part way there and I see my ex-sister-in-law\\u2019s two dogs. I forget their names, they\\u2019re a specialty breed and look kind of like poodles or labradoodles, medium sized-dogs. I see them in the snow. One is more of a carmel color and the other is more white. The carmel color one is having trouble walking through the snow. It\\u2019s stopping and the snow plow hasn\\u2019t come by yet. They think they\\u2019re in a snow bank but they\\u2019re actually in the middle of the road. I pick up the carmel colored one and the white one is still running through. I forget their names so I\\u2019m just calling it, \\u201cCome on! Come on you can do this!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to encourage it to go back over to the sidewalk. I\\u2019m going to walk the dogs home. The one I\\u2019m carrying is kind of heavy and my feet and legs feel heavy because of the snow. I look behind me for one second and then I don\\u2019t see the white one anymore. I look back the way I came and it\\u2019s lying down in the middle of the road. At first I think it\\u2019s dead. I touch it and it responds and it\\u2019s still warm, so it\\u2019s not dead. Now I\\u2019ve got both of the dogs in my arms and am trying to hold them under my arms like two footballs. They\\u2019re obviously sick and not well. I\\u2019m worried that their life is beginning to blink out. I\\u2019m struggling with them as I go down the sidewalk into the Co-op. It\\u2019s funny because she never lived there, but her twin sister did. I get stuck. There\\u2019s a community yard sale going on. I notice where the office used to be is a sign that now says, \\u201cSeneca College.\\u201d It\\u2019s now an office where they are trying to recruit teenagers from the Co-op directly into the college. I think that\\u2019s a pretty good idea. I\\u2019m trying to walk up the sidewalk towards her unit. There\\u2019s another dog and it\\u2019s a whippet - a racing dog with a long pointy nose. It\\u2019s snarling and growling aggressively as if it\\u2019s going to attack the other two dogs. I\\u2019ve got them in my arms and they\\u2019re not responding. They\\u2019re barely breathing. I tell this group of teenagers: \\u201cCan you please go ahead of me so there are people between that dog and these because it\\u2019s going to attack. They oblige. They do and are really nice about it. But we\\u2019re moving really slowly. I finally get to her door and knock on it and say, \\u201cLook who I found.\\u201d She\\u2019s so grateful and I say, \\u201cOh, you live beside where I live!\\u201d Now it\\u2019s twenty years ago and I\\u2019m apparently living in the same unit I lived in when my daughter was little. She gets the dogs back and puts them in a specialty bed she made for them. She\\u2019s a nurse and is looking after them and everything seems to be fine.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Symphony\\u201d I\\u2019m at my friends Maggie and Joey\\u2019s house, only it\\u2019s not their house, it\\u2019s the old Farm House. Maggie and Joey live there. I\\u2019ve gone up to visit them. Maggie has all kinds of little interesting things for us to do. We\\u2019re making jelly at one point. Then we go into a different room and are doing a craft. We\\u2019re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he\\u2019s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That\\u2019s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on with him because he\\u2019s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, \\u201cCome and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he\\u2019s wearing a tux.\\u201d I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some \\u201cdoing of the hair.\\u201d I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She\\u2019s got several things that she\\u2019s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don\\u2019t think anything of this. I think she\\u2019s just seeing how this will look or how these two items will look if you put them together. Then she says to me, \\u201cI can\\u2019t go. I\\u2019m really sick. I don\\u2019t feel up to this. But it\\u2019s something Joey really wants to do.\\u201d I ask her, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re sick?\\u201d She tells me she\\u2019s been sick for a really long time and she thinks that her time is limited. I feel this grief moving up through my feet, through my legs and into my heart. It kind of suspends all my decision making qualities. I\\u2019m just standing there trying to take this all in. i look at her really closely, looking for traces of truth, not of her words, but that her body is actually that sick. I\\u2019m looking at her skin and the sclera of her eyes. I\\u2019m trying to see what I have not noticed before and wasn\\u2019t aware of. Then I tell her I don\\u2019t want to go to the symphony and she should do this because it\\u2019s something special and they\\u2019ve been planning it for a long time. Then suddenly her hair is drawn back into a formal style with a bun at the back of her head. She\\u2019s wearing earrings that dangle down from her ears. She\\u2019s dressed in a strapless gown. She looks beautiful. We go back down the stairs. This time she disappears into the kitchen. I\\u2019m in the living room and Joey is standing there. I say, \\u201cI hope you guys have a really good time. This will be wonderful. You two look fabulous.\\u201d He comes over and gives me a hug. His face is overtop my left shoulder. I can feel that he\\u2019s crying. He says, \\u201cI hope you're still here when we get back.\\u201d Now I just feel kind of numb. I feel heavy. I no longer know what to do while they\\u2019re gone and I don\\u2019t want to stay in the house but I do. I look outside down the long farmhouse style driveway. All the earth looks frozen. The trees are bare. There\\u2019s no growth left in the ground. It\\u2019s nighttime. Even in the activity that was in the house of jamming things in jars and making preserves is tucked away. The house feels empty. I think, \\u201cMaybe I should just have a bath and go to bed.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Talent Show\\u201d I\\u2019m at a Yoga Studio where I used to teach but stopped because they basically tricked me into working for them by promising me a certain rate but refused to sign a contract I asked them to sign. I worked for them for a whole month without knowing what I would be paid. They figured I would just keep doing it because I had formed an attachment to the people in the class. I\\u2019m just standing inside the front door of the studio. My son is with me. I see the owner\\u2019s daughter but I don\\u2019t recognize her at first because she\\u2019s lost so much weight, she\\u2019s even about six inches shorter, and she\\u2019s wearing a lot of eye makeup. I deduce who she is because she\\u2019s behind the desk, not because I recognize her. There are a lot of people and families in there and in fact it\\u2019s packed, which surprises me. The owner walks in and he gives me a cold glance and keeps walking. My son has mingled with the people, although I didn\\u2019t intend to stay, I need to get him to go home. The only reason I\\u2019m there is to pick something up from the desk. The owner\\u2019s daughter is looking for it for me. The director is the main person that wouldn\\u2019t sign the contract and kept telling me she was going to the next day and the day and the next day until I started teaching. She delayed until they thought it was too difficult for me to back out. She\\u2019s behind me and gushing about being so happy to see me. I feel like it\\u2019s a performance for the people standing around. She\\u2019s got one of her hands on each of my shoulders and she\\u2019s standing behind me but to the side. I feel repulsed by the fact that she\\u2019s touching me and pretending to be this beaming friendly person when she\\u2019s a viper on the inside. Then, it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being moved forward by the crowd. I move with the flow because I\\u2019m scanning for my son and I need him because I\\u2019m ready to go. The owner\\u2019s daughter is standing beside me and talking to me. We get into the actual practice room and there\\u2019s a stage at the front. There must be two-hundred people in there, families, sitting on blankets and towels. She asks me if I want to sit down beside her. I agree. Then I gradually take in what\\u2019s going on here. It\\u2019s set up for kids. All the kids are wearing costumes and there are three boys on the stage. They\\u2019re setting up for some kind of act. I finally catch up with my son and he says, \\u201cMom, can we please stay? I want to sing two songs.\\u201d The owner\\u2019s daughter indicates that it would be okay if we stayed. I tell him, \\u201cAlright.\\u201d We sit down. For the first act, you can\\u2019t even figure out what the boys are doing. They\\u2019re on for about ten minutes. Nobody is stage directing. It\\u2019s just really laissez-faire. Other kids are running across the stage as these three are acting out something, but it\\u2019s not cohesive, it has no direction. At one point, one jumps down from the stage really slowly and pretends to fall. The other takes a run from the side and slides across the stage. It just goes on and on. I think, \\u201cOh my god, we\\u2019re going to be here for hours and hours.\\u201d That\\u2019s how the dream ends, just sitting and waiting.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Time Machine\\u201d This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There\\u2019s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house\\u2019s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it\\u2019s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I\\u2019m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it\\u2019s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, \\u201cI have to take this.\\u201d He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he\\u2019s in the kitchen, although I haven\\u2019t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He\\u2019s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, \\u201cHe left you a gift.\\u201d I feel sad. I also feel like I don\\u2019t want to be alone with her. I\\u2019m starting to wonder how I\\u2019m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I\\u2019m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I\\u2019m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there\\u2019s a really strong emotion. It\\u2019s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that\\u2019s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn\\u2019t appear and I knew it wouldn\\u2019t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I\\u2019m an adult now. I\\u2019m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it\\u2019s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don\\u2019t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I\\u2019m hoping they\\u2019ll still be there when I leave. I\\u2019m glad he still hasn\\u2019t returned to England and I\\u2019ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I\\u2019m confused because I can\\u2019t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it\\u2019s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they\\u2019re in charge: \\u201cDo you know what happened to the classrooms?\\u201d She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, \\u201cDo you know this one is out of date?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, no I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, you\\u2019ll need to go down to the office.\\u201d She tells me the number of the office and says, \\u201cYou need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They\\u2019re just saying hello and stuff and I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren\\u2019s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on asphalt in a really old town. I\\u2019m part of a play. It\\u2019s like a movie set, but it\\u2019s not a movie set, it\\u2019s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I\\u2019ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It\\u2019s white and about 12 inches square - it\\u2019s a cube. They put this in between each word. It\\u2019s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that\\u2019s describing this tells me, \\u201cYes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they\\u2019ve been forgotten.\\u201d He told me the one we\\u2019re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there\\u2019s a picnic table. We\\u2019re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we\\u2019re waiting. It\\u2019s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it\\u2019s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They\\u2019re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn\\u2019t have food, though. He has sewing. I\\u2019m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don\\u2019t even know what it is - I choose that one. I\\u2019m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it\\u2019s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we\\u2019re entering this vehicle. It\\u2019s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but I think it\\u2019s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it\\u2019s got some kind of engine - it\\u2019s not very loud; it\\u2019s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we\\u2019re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,\\u201dWe\\u2019re going out this way.\\u201d I watch them and am thinking, \\u201cOh my god! They\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d They\\u2019re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Toddler\\u201d In this dream, I am on a beach at a resort. I am somehow inserted with this family and the son is one of my friends in real life . He\\u2019s on the periphery of the dream - he comes in with the family and does some stuff, then leaves and does his own thing. I don\\u2019t seem to be as mobile. There\\u2019s two sisters and one brother. The one sister has three children and her partner. The other sister does not have any; she doesn\\u2019t have a partner either. I don\\u2019t really have anything to do with any of them. In the dream, I am in this enclosure. It\\u2019s kind of open like a yurt situated on the beach. I seem to be involved with the careeving of the kids. One boy is 7 and my friend does a lot of things with this 7 year old kid. In the dream, I notice that he\\u2019s a gym teacher. He takes his 7 year old nephew with him to class a lot, so they share a lot of quality time together. They share a love of movement and athletic sports. At one point, I realize that my friend is actually wearing the 7 year old\\u2019s clothes. He takes his shirt off at one point and the hat. I\\u2019m looking at them on the counter and I don't want to directly ask him if he\\u2019s wearing the 7 year old\\u2019s clothes, so I look at the tags on the hat and the clothes and I say, \\u201cThese say size 7. I\\u2019m surprised that they fit you.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s possible that they may be my nephew\\u2019s clothing.\\u201d At that point I realize we\\u2019re in a change room. I\\u2019m also changing and every time I take off my shorts, there\\u2019s another pair of shorts underneath them. I keep trying to take them off because I\\u2019m trying to change and it just keeps going on and on, like 10-20 times where I keep taking them off and there\\u2019s another pair of shorts underneath them. In the dream, this frustrates me. I give up trying to change and I go back from that one area of the yurt where people change to the common area where people are sitting and eating. The dad asks me if I would sit with the youngest child of the three for a few minutes, so I do. The child tells me that his name is Mason and he\\u2019s not two years old yet, he\\u2019s barely over 1, probably about 14 months old. He starts talking to me and telling me what he wants to eat and how to make it. I\\u2019m listening to him and he has the voice of an old man - not a voice that sounds like an old man, but what he\\u2019s saying is in a mature voice of a person much older than he is. I\\u2019m wondering if anyone else realizes this. The dad comes and sits down beside me for a moment. Without asking the question, I just look at him and he tells me that his son has some abilities we don\\u2019t fully know about yet. I think that must explain the deep observations this very young child is talking to. Plus I realize that any words at all at 14 months is advanced. I feel this child has a mystical quality to him. l check out for the rest of the dream, whatever activities I had been involved in, I decide to hang out with this baby and just listen to this baby and the observations he\\u2019s making because the soul that is in his body is someone he\\u2019s channeling that is very wise. I do this for some time and I feel like I\\u2019ve been shared with. The rest of the dream takes on some kind of mystical quality. I see the other sister that doesn\\u2019t have any children on the beach. She\\u2019s wearing clothes that will attract attention to her body. She\\u2019s very beautiful. I see her wrapped up in the need to be admired and not so much connecting to the people around her. The dream deconstructs and I\\u2019m in a house I lived in when I was teaching college. I lived there with a roommate on Simcoe Street in a city that starts with O. My ex-husband is in there, as well. He is spending an inordinate amount of money on something and I realize I\\u2019ve been paying for it without consciously being aware of it. I ask him if we can talk about this. He keeps saying later. I realize in the dream that I either have to keep paying for his lack of conscious awareness or if I stop paying for it, he will just disappear.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Toothbrush\\u201d In this dream, I am on my way to a concert in Toronto. I\\u2019m with a couple friends - one is a friend of mine, A.G., and the other is my first boyfriend for a little while in high school. We\\u2019ll call him Daren. So in this dream, I\\u2019m with A.G. and Daren. and we\\u2019re on our way to a concert. We stop at his parent\\u2019s place which isn\\u2019t where his parents actually lived. It\\u2019s in a city called Burlington and they\\u2019re living on Plains Rd. The house is really dense on the inside. It\\u2019s like a hoarder house where you can\\u2019t walk through the hallways. You can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on the other end of the hallways. They have all these pets that they\\u2019re constantly looking for because they can\\u2019t find them in all this hoarding mess. So we arrive there and I guess we have to stay overnight. We\\u2019ve arrived late and the concert is the next day in the afternoon, so we\\u2019ve decided to go and sleep there because it\\u2019s closer to leave from his parents\\u2019 place. When we get there, his mom is looking for one of the pets - it\\u2019s this weird amalgamation of a dog and a cat. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog but when I look more closely at it, it has the body of a cat and the neck and head of a dog. We see it for a moment and then it\\u2019s gone again. So all of us are trying to squeeze our way through this house. It seems like in the dream I\\u2019m doing this without any contact from anyone else for what feels like hours. Then I come out into the kitchen and I see Daren and I ask him if he\\u2019s had any luck. He says, \\u201cNot yet, but there\\u2019s this whole other half of the house I haven\\u2019t checked.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say this outloud but I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, this house is so much bigger than it appears to be because of all the stuff.\\u201d So we start off together into the doorway through the other side of the house. It\\u2019s like the air in there is colder - the way it would feel if you were going down in altitude into a cave where it just feels damper and colder, but it still has stuff in it. I can\\u2019t see anything. I see this other creature. It\\u2019s a combination of a hedgehog and a guinea pig. It walks past me and Daren says to me, \\u201cMake sure you don\\u2019t let that guy out.\\u201d I look and suddenly realize there\\u2019s a pocket door I could close, so I do. The little creature stays in there. We get out of this next hallway and his mom and dad are sitting in the next clearing. Daren tells them that he hasn\\u2019t been able to find the dog. Then I look over and I say, \\u201cIs that it?\\u201d It\\u2019s partially masked by some other thing and I can\\u2019t even figure out what this creature is. It\\u2019s black and it has limbs, but there\\u2019s no discernable face on it. Daren says, \\u201cYes that\\u2019s it!\\u201d And he goes over and gets it and picks it up and takes it to his mom. They\\u2019re so happy and patting it. I leave them there and see there\\u2019s a door behind the dad which actually has daylight. I decide to leave out that door, walk all the way around and come in the other door we entered in. It\\u2019s a measure of avoiding all these cluttered passages. So I do that and when I come in, my friend is trying to kiss Daren and I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cThat\\u2019s very strange behavior for her and awkward!\\u201d But he pulls back and walks over. Now I have a cup of tea in my hand and I\\u2019m sitting at a table and I see that his eyes are actually filling up with tears. He\\u2019s upset that she did that. I say, \\u201cWell, why didn\\u2019t you tell her? You should have said something.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ruin this for everyone.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll go over and say something\\u201d He tells me not to for the same reason - it will ruin this event. I\\u2019m sitting with this and thinking that it\\u2019s kind of ruined anyway. It\\u2019s awkward and with no one talking about it, it will just sit there and fester. Then he says, \\u201cAre you ready to go?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat? No! I haven\\u2019t even finished my tea.\\u201d I realize that when I came in, I had a toothbrush and I brushed my teeth in the bathroom. I can\\u2019t figure out how to get through all these hallways with the clutter to go back and check the bathroom. I look through my suitcase which is just a little carry case like a backpack with a whole bunch of zippers. I\\u2019m opening all the zippers and looking in each compartment and it looks like it has my belongings in it, but each zippered compartment is empty. There's no toothbrush and I tell him I don\\u2019t want to leave without brushing my teeth. He does the eye roll thing, \\u201cYou better hurry up, I don\\u2019t want to be late.\\u201d So the rest of the dream I\\u2019m lifting up things and looking underneath them, trying to find my toothbrush.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Trek\\u201d The setting is in a way that it\\u2019s not the orderly kind of linear almost based on Roman architecture grid for cities that we have now - it\\u2019s not like that, it\\u2019s much different. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Agrarian either. I get the feeling that it\\u2019s again post-apocalyptic, but much further along in the future than the dream when I was standing in a burnt world and started choking and woke up because I was choking. Everyone here, we are wearing ragged bits of eclectic pieces of clothing. There\\u2019s no real recognizable city structure. There\\u2019s ruined buildings with grass and vegetation growing up, in, around the building. People have settled there and built structures out of other scraps and things. It\\u2019s not unpleasant to look at. It has a settled, organized, civilized feel to it. However, there\\u2019s agrimony between groups of people who have settled around these places. Part of the group that I am settling with, we know we have to flee or we\\u2019re probably going to be killed. So we organize very quickly. We can\\u2019t bring all of our stuff. Our stuff is an eclectic variety of things that we use to feed ourselves and clothe ourselves with. Some people have backpacks and these are being dispersed among the group. I\\u2019d say there\\u2019s probably about 60 or 75 in my group, but for the purpose of traveling and feeding ourselves, we organize ourselves into four groups, so there\\u2019s about twelve to fifteen in each group. They are dividing people into groups by skill level, so if you have already shown some survival skill behavior, they don\\u2019t put all of those people in one group. They\\u2019re separating them so there\\u2019s at least one person who\\u2019s got some know-how in each group. I\\u2019m one of those people who has some survival skills. I\\u2019m separated from some of my closer friends because we can\\u2019t all travel together and this makes me sad. We also have people in the group who have babies. There\\u2019s one woman who\\u2019s carrying a baby. They also divide these people up because they drag people down. They can\\u2019t hunt and some of them don\\u2019t have survival skills - they feel more dependent. We also have got two toddlers in our group and they\\u2019re not even clothed. They\\u2019re running around naked and we\\u2019re trying to find small backpacks they can carry and some clothes that will fit them. They were dividing toddlers up and they\\u2019re not even with their parents - I have a feeling that they don\\u2019t have parents. They are just random toddlers, so they\\u2019re divided up into groups. So we leave separately. All this organizing and scavenging for equipment that we can carry on our backs is done before nightfall. We leave undercover of the dark. We know we cannot follow each other when we\\u2019re traveling in all these different groups because that will reduce the chances that we\\u2019ll survive. We need to be in smaller groups, so we won\\u2019t be spotted. Much of the dream is climbing over landscapes - meadows and cliffs and forests and swampy muddy things where we get completely filthy, but then find a body of water to wash in. There\\u2019s some skirmishes within the group where people are hungry and stealing each other\\u2019s food, including the toddlers. I have to take extra food away from kids - you know how kids will just randomly run around and graze, they\\u2019ll just shove food in their mouths as they\\u2019re going - I can\\u2019t let them do that. I have to keep them on the rations. So this is one dream memory of me opening up the toddlers hands and opening them up because they\\u2019ve got three times more of the berries than they\\u2019re supposed to have and I have to disperse these around. Part of me, as I\\u2019m doing this, feels regret because the child is so innocent - it\\u2019s a natural thing for a child to do and I feel a little sadness. I also feel a little bit of inner frustration that I even have a toddler that I have to do this with when we\\u2019re trying so hard to survive. So it\\u2019s an honest mixture of feelings that I have when I\\u2019m doing this. As we climb over more complicated and go through more dense flora and fauna, there\\u2019s a part where I\\u2019m aware that the group that is pursuing us and trying to kill us is actually on our trail. I realize they\\u2019re getting closer. I see this because I\\u2019ve climbed up high. There's an alarm in the middle of the night. I have to wake everybody up and get them to move. Some of them don\\u2019t want to and I\\u2019m like, pack your backpack! And some people don\\u2019t want to carry it, and I\\u2019m like if you don\\u2019t get up and move we\\u2019re going to have to leave you here! So I end up carrying three more packs than I\\u2019m supposed to. I end up getting everybody up, but there\\u2019s a couple of people that were groggy and wouldn\\u2019t wake up, they may be with the group, but I\\u2019m not sure and we have to move. Then we are in like the Amazon forest and we rappel up. We make it all the way up. It\\u2019s hard. We\\u2019re carrying toddlers in packs, passing things out, and we make it up to the top. We are safe now from that group. The landscape is still pretty densely forested. As we realize we\\u2019re safe, we\\u2019re able to spread out and rest a little bit. It was pretty onerous getting up there like that and so has the whole journey. So we take a couple days to rest. As I\\u2019m doing this and we\\u2019re setting up a makeshift camp, I realize that one of the other groups is close by and doing a similar thing. I sneak through the underbrush and I was about to make contact and ask the leader if they think it\\u2019s safe to join up just for the rest part, I see that my ex best friend is in that group, and now I don\\u2019t want to. I don\\u2019t want to have any communication with her. I\\u2019m glad she\\u2019s out of my life. She\\u2019s really hurt me and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re no longer friends. I don\\u2019t want her back in. She\\u2019s also narcissistic and I feel much better now that she\\u2019s out of my life. But there\\u2019s also some sadness with it too - when someone you love and care about betrays you, there\\u2019s also some sadness. So I feel this emotion going through my body. By this time, the other leader is aware of our group. Some of the members of their group have spread out far enough so everyone knows that we\\u2019re both here. So I end up having to suck it up as we get together with this other group for a meal. There\\u2019s people in that group who were friends of mine from before we had to leave our home, so I\\u2019m having this pleasant conversation with them. It\\u2019s a feeling of camaraderie. I\\u2019m aware that my friend knows I\\u2019m there. I also feel this thread of self satisfaction that she\\u2019s not one of the organizers - she didn\\u2019t have survival skills. Her skills were based on what she could suck off of others, so she\\u2019s demoted into that part of the social fabric of her group and I will truthfully admit to feeling a smack of satisfaction over that. The dream ends with us folding up our camps and putting them all back in our backpacks. You wouldn\\u2019t even know we were there. We\\u2019re brushing any vegetation that has been flattened with sticks with leaves on them and we continue on our trek.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Wall\\u201d The second dream, I\\u2019m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I\\u2019m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they\\u2019ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won\\u2019t be aware of what they\\u2019ve actually been doing. I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they\\u2019re hiding, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you even hiding that? It\\u2019s just a book.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I\\u2019m still a teenager in it, though, and I\\u2019ve moved out of their house but I\\u2019ve gone back for a visit. There\\u2019s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there\\u2019s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I\\u2019m looking at what she\\u2019s brought out. I see a couple things and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! That was mine! I don\\u2019t remember hiding that and I didn\\u2019t even notice I was missing it.\\u201d So in the dream, we\\u2019re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don\\u2019t know what to do with mine. I guess I don\\u2019t have any pockets. I can\\u2019t seem to think in the dream, \\u201cOh why don\\u2019t I just take them with me?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m encumbered with the idea that the mom can\\u2019t see it and I\\u2019ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, \\u201cMom, Freya\\u2019s been hiding things in the wall.\\u201d Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she\\u2019s really disappointed in me that I\\u2019ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I\\u2019m thinking I don\\u2019t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I\\u2019m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Warpath\\u201d I\\u2019m living with a group of people outside on the plains, like a meadow but the earth is soft. We live and sleep outside. We\\u2019re on the way somewhere, we\\u2019re traveling. We\\u2019re tired and we need to stop and rest. We have adults as well as elderly people and some young kids in our group as well. I\\u2019d say when the dream starts there are probably about one hundred of us. We gather flower tops and berries and roots as well as small animals and that\\u2019s our food. I don\\u2019t get the small animals, but somebody does. We sleep on the grass, too. We\\u2019ve got wool blankets that we wrap ourselves in. There\\u2019s a group of indigenous people and the first time we come into contact with them, they have deep reddish brown horses that they\\u2019re riding. They just come in and they sweep through and it\\u2019s so quick and so violent that we\\u2019re in shock, we\\u2019re stunned, we don\\u2019t even react. Some of us just run and others are caught up by them or killed instantly. A couple of the women are carried off. We don\\u2019t know where to go to hide from them because there\\u2019s just more of this wide open plains area. So what we do instead is we\\u2019ve got these iron spikes, they\\u2019re like pegs that are about nine inches long. The next day we drive them into the ground around the outskirts of where we are so that the next time they come, they ones on foot will step on these and so will their horses and hopefully that will deter them from the mad sweep that they do really fast - they won\\u2019t be able to do that and that will give us a little bit more time to get away. All day long we spend driving these stakes into the ground so they stick up about six inches from the ground and about six feet apart, but they won\\u2019t be able to see them because they came at dusk last time and we know they\\u2019re going to do that again, probably at dusk. That night when we sit down to eat they don\\u2019t come, nothing happens. We eat, we sleep, we wake up again. A few nights pass like this. We\\u2019re pretty sure they\\u2019re going to come back. But during that period of time while we\\u2019re waiting, I have a few conversations with some of the kids, like the almost pubescent boys. There\\u2019s a group of three or four of them that sit there sullenly the way teenagers can be though they\\u2019re not yet teeangers. One of them in particular doesn\\u2019t like how the adults in the group are handling this at all. He\\u2019s becoming bitter and angry. I\\u2019m asking him how he thinks things should be done differently. He says that we should just get out of there. I say, \\u201cOkay, where would you have us go?\\u201d Then he doesn\\u2019t answer. There\\u2019s another one who is upset by his attitude and when I leave the conversation they get into a fist fight. Me and a few of the others go in and break it up. We know we need to do something differently and there\\u2019s that generally consensus starting to thread its way through our group. Now there\\u2019s not a hundred of us anymore, there\\u2019s about seventy because thirty were killed or taken the last time there was a raid. It\\u2019s that night that as soon as we finish eating, it\\u2019s just dusk when things are grey, when the natives come through again. They\\u2019re slowed down a little bit by the spikes but they quickly figure out they can go around them. More people do manage to get away and they only pick off about twenty this time. But this reduces us to fifty. The next day some of the men say they\\u2019re going to scout to see if there\\u2019s any other place we can go. They go into the forest. The forest is really thick and this is the issue. Do we keep moving forward on the plains or do we risk what\\u2019s in the forest? So that\\u2019s where a couple of men go to see if we can shelter there. But we also want to keep moving and we don\\u2019t want to just sit there hiding in fear which is where we might get stuck if we go into the forest. We\\u2019re thinking about what else we can do to defend ourselves from these raids. There\\u2019s also the elderly people who really aren\\u2019t capable of moving much farther at this point. We continue spending our days driving these iron spikes into the earth, trying to spread them around so we have a complete circle around us. That night when the men come back they say they\\u2019ve got good news and bad news. They tell us that they think there\\u2019s a different way of life moving forward from here, but we\\u2019ll have to change how we relate to each other as a group. One of them says, \\u201cEach woman has to pair up with a man and stay with him forever. The one man will be responsible for the survival of the one woman.\\u201d I think this is ridiculous. What\\u2019s going to happen to all these elderly people? There are no men for the elderly women, so who\\u2019s going to speak for them? I\\u2019m also disgusted and thinking, \\u201cEw there\\u2019s not one of you in this group that I want to stay with forever.\\u201d I\\u2019m suspicious about where this idea came from. The two of them maybe cooked this up together when they went into the forest and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a solution and won\\u2019t help the group survive as a group, it will just pick certain people out of it and leave the other ones to die. It really upsets me. That night the natives come through one more time. Only this time they only carry off one of the women. We\\u2019re sitting at a group of about forty-five people left. I\\u2019m avoiding picking any one of the men tonight. In fact, I\\u2019ve decided to stand up for the elderly and I will feed them at my table and give them seats there. The teeangers, the younger boys that I talked to the other night, also seem to agree with me and they moved their sleeping mats to where I\\u2019m sleeping with these eldelry people.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Waterfall\\u201d I\\u2019m getting ready to go for a hike with my friend. We are just meeting at a house, I think it\\u2019s mine, but it\\u2019s a house I\\u2019ve never lived in in real life. My kids are still asleep in it. Then the dream backtracks - it\\u2019s like it freezes there - to the night before. I was in my room with my son and my daughter. We were playing some kind of game. The tools for it looked like markers, but they were actually magnetic. When you applied them to the board, which looked like a whiteboard, they left a colored line even though they were magnets and not markers filled with any kind of liquid color. They were not felt-tipped. The tips were really hard. As we were playing with them, it wasn\\u2019t just a free flow creative \\u201clet\\u2019s draw this.\\u201d There was some kind of instruction that went with the game. It was working out fine. We had to do an algebra or conning - which is how you navigate a boat using the chart of the water. So we were following the instructions, doing the equations, then putting dots on the whiteboard with these magnetic markers. I guess it was taking a long time because the magnetic pens started to disintegrate, but my kids kept playing the game - they kept doing the calculations. I was trying to fix the magnetic pens - the lids had popped off of some of them and were in the bottom of the container. Then it started getting more complicated. So instead of being a set of ten and they all looked like they were different colors, it was like there were three sets. They were all different shapes and the lids were all different sizes. One of the lids looked like it fit on one purple pen, but it didn\\u2019t, it actually fit on the other purple one. They wouldn\\u2019t leave the dots on the board unless the lids and the ends were on properly. And then the wires that were part of the internal workings started coming out of the ends and I was trying to reassemble them. This tired my children after a while and they both went to sleep. My son was sleeping on the floor in my bedroom and my daughter was in a bed in her room. The night passed and I didn\\u2019t sleep, but my kids did. Then it was time for my hike. My friend was downstairs waiting for me. My son got up. He was just roaming around the house doing his own thing and making some food. My daughter was still sleeping. I wanted to leave her a note. I found one piece of paper that was all blacked out except for a small white square. I wrote on it with a pencil that I was going for a hike and then \\u201cxoxo\\u201d Love mom. I put it on her bed and then I realized that she found a box of old pictures and had stayed up quite late looking at them. She had a pile of her favorites. They were old family pictures that went beyond back to her family before she was born. I remember gently putting my hand on her hip and wiggling her a little bit to wake her up. She was kind of grumpy and when she realized she didn\\u2019t have to get up and I was just saying goodbye before going for my hike, she smiled and said, \\u201cLook at all the pictures.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s really nice.\\u201d They were taken care of. My friend and I changed, making sure we weren\\u2019t wearing anything bright. We were wearing some kind of green clothes to go on the hike so we wouldn\\u2019t stand out. We drove to the place we were hiking. It was a short drive away. The last thing I remember is we hiked quite a bit and it was an older forest. It reminds me of the forests in British Columbia. The trees are huge giant redwoods. We came to a waterfall and it was skinny and long and tall and it extended up into the sky, farther than my eyes could see. I just remember standing there feeling how big it was - how beautiful and how primal.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Whalers\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m part of someone else\\u2019s story. In the story, she has a childhood nightmare and she's written a story about it as a 20-something year old person. She\\u2019s taken the idea to go back through her own story in order to ease it or release it. I\\u2019m one of the people that is in the story with her. We go down to the shore of the lake and there\\u2019s a prearranged yellow inflatable raft - like an expensive Zodiac dinghy. There are three or four others with us. We get into the dinghy and we\\u2019re dressed for whaling. We are wearing rain gear and waterproof boots that are zipped into the rain gear. In the story, that I become aware of as we\\u2019re moving through the water, her father is a whaler. She has nightmares about some things that happened when she was a kid and went whaling with her father. We get closer to the area we\\u2019re supposed to be. At first I see everything from far away and I feel a fear and my heart rate is starting to build because out on the water, there are giant metal things. They look really small right now, but I\\u2019m already thinking that they are going to be really big and we are going to be really small once we get closer.I\\u2019ve never been whaling before. I question agreeing to go on this excursion. Obviously, we get closer. Then there\\u2019s this circle thing that other people in dinghies are gathering around. It\\u2019s like a large buoy. As we approach, we\\u2019re not allowed to go any further. We have to wait with these other people and we are just kind of circling around this really large bouey. The buoy is probably 30 feet tall - I can\\u2019t even see the top of it. We\\u2019re waiting for someone who has organized this to arrive. I notice that the other people in the dinghies all seem to be seniors. I wonder if they\\u2019re here as tourists. Finally the person that\\u2019s organized it arrives and I don\\u2019t see who they are. People start being able to leave out through the gate. We are now moving from that area out towards these large metal things. I feel really anxious and horrible as I can see there are hooks. I think to myself that the whales must have hung from these hooks. I\\u2019m just in the space of horror as she\\u2019s conversing with the organizer of this excursion. The dinghy gets closer to them, and as I thought, they are really large. We are quite small. The seniors in the other boats are pointing at them and oohing and awing. We circle around them. The dinghy goes a lot slower. Then we start to reverse the direction and go back. We get out of the dinghy at the buoy. Now there\\u2019s reef and shallow water vegetation and a pier. I just get out on foot and continue on.\"],[\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s Crime in Cafes\\u201d It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don\\u2019t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They\\u2019re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don\\u2019t even know how deep it goes. So there\\u2019s a self-serve area at one end - that\\u2019s the end that goes on and on and I don\\u2019t know how deep it goes. At the other end that\\u2019s open, it has long tables where you can take what you\\u2019ve selected and eat there with people. It\\u2019s packed. So, the dream opens and I\\u2019m sitting at a table. I\\u2019m not eating though. I\\u2019m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She\\u2019s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it\\u2019s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we\\u2019re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There\\u2019s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there\\u2019s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it\\u2019s finished, we go to the room next door. There\\u2019s another teacher in there that we\\u2019re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he\\u2019s trying to undermine the first teacher. We\\u2019ve gotten our lunch out and we\\u2019re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we\\u2019re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We\\u2019re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she\\u2019s still there. We share this information with her. She\\u2019s grateful. We tell her that we\\u2019ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you here at the same time the next day.\\u201d So while I\\u2019m lining up to go and get food, first there\\u2019s this thing that happens with gum. There\\u2019s a direction by the cashier - it\\u2019s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, \\u201cWhy are they doing this? I don\\u2019t even want all this gum.\\u201d So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! $50 for something I don\\u2019t even want.\\u201d However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I\\u2019m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don\\u2019t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I\\u2019m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he\\u2019s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no! That\\u2019s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!\\u201d He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn\\u2019t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I\\u2019ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don\\u2019t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There\\u2019s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It\\u2019s crowded and it\\u2019s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There\\u2019s people walking in the street. It\\u2019s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I\\u2019m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what\\u2019s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He\\u2019s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They\\u2019re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don\\u2019t know if they've purchased them or if he\\u2019s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what\\u2019s in the bag. They open it up and there\\u2019s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We\\u2019re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.\\u201d They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He\\u2019s giving it away and he\\u2019s giving it to children. He\\u2019s helping people. I think, \\u201cOh! Well he\\u2019s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they\\u2019re looking for this person?\\u201d So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn\\u2019t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren\\u2019t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I\\u2019m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she\\u2019s there. She\\u2019s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50\\u2019s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it\\u2019s got a rounded collar and she\\u2019s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s dressed up really nicely. She\\u2019s in her good dress.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t see me. In fact, we don\\u2019t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she\\u2019s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I\\u2019m supposed to have, knowing that I can\\u2019t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she\\u2019s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I\\u2019d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can\\u2019t really. I wonder if she\\u2019s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He\\u2019s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He\\u2019s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cTwisting by the Pool\\u201d I am going to a public swimming pool that has adult swim lengths. This is odd because I can't swim. In the dream, I am going to the adult swim lengths and the complex with the pool is located in a shopping mall. I swim my lengths and nobody else is there - it\\u2019s a private pool. Then afterwards, I shower at the pool. I put on something that I've brought with me that keeps your body warm and it\\u2019s very soft. The colors are neutral - grey. As I\\u2019m walking through the mall, my feet are cold because I\\u2019m wearing those shower shoes that are like flip flops. I notice in a store window a pair of shoes that are a bright indigo blue and they look really warm. They have a faux sheepskin lining and soft pleather or suede on the outside. They look like a moccasin. Suddenly, they\\u2019re on my feet. I look down and think, \\u201cOh, my feet feel so much better now.\\u201d As I continue to walk through the mall, the stores are all closed and there are no people around. I notice the restaurant where I used to work and think maybe I\\u2019ll stop in and see if I know anyone. So I walk into the restaurant. It\\u2019s not open and there are no customers or staff yet. I walk to the back and there\\u2019s a little place you can stand in front of the kitchen and behind where the customers can see. It\\u2019s a place where the staff stand and wait for the food to come out through the window. I\\u2019m just standing there. Then the owner comes out and he\\u2019s busy carrying some things. He has dishes in his hands and is stacking them up getting things ready for the day. He tells me to stand still. So I stand in between these two walls - one is to the kitchen and one is where the staff wait. He takes me by the wrists and he starts to spin me around in a circle. I look at him and am puzzled and say, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust trust me.\\u201d So he spins me around really quickly. I can feel the centripetal gravity pushing me away but he does have me by the wrists. Then there\\u2019s this moment where I can either fight it and try to slow down and pull my body towards the center or I can let go and just trust that it will be fine. I let go and I feel something that was hardwired tight in the middle of me snap. There are a few more moments of going around and around and he says, \\u201cThere, you\\u2019ve got it now.\\u201d He slows down. He must know I\\u2019m dizzy because I have no equilibrium, no balance. He tells me, \\u201cJust put your head down for a minute.\\u201d I bend my knees and come into a child\\u2019s pose with my forehead on the ground. I\\u2019m just allowing everything to spin. I feel weightless. There\\u2019s some kind of different energy running through my body. I feel the dizziness pass enough that I think it\\u2019s okay to stand up and I do. I am looking around. I can see the staff are in the restaurant now and they\\u2019re all busy at their own stations setting up and preparing for the day. Then I\\u2019m really self conscious and notice what I\\u2019m wearing. I think it looks like pajamas and slippers. I don\\u2019t want anybody to see me. So I\\u2019m waiting until nobody is standing by the side door to exit out of there. This couple comes up and it\\u2019s not clear what the woman wants, but she\\u2019s asking me for help. I\\u2019m thinking I should just spin her around so that she\\u2019s not worried about it anymore. I feel like there\\u2019s a moment when I tried that, but she\\u2019s too frail. So I tell her we should go out for a walk. They come with me. All of a sudden the owner is also there on the walk, although I don\\u2019t remember inviting him and I don\\u2019t know why he's there. I look down at my feet and legs. There\\u2019s a thick layer of snow on the ground and I think I\\u2019m going to freeze. Then all of a sudden I\\u2019m wearing the winter coat that I used to wear when I was pregnant, so it\\u2019s big. I\\u2019m not cold anymore. I look over at the woman and now she\\u2019s improperly dressed and her teeth are chattering and her skin is turning blue. I think she\\u2019s got hypothermia. I tell her to come over and say, \\u201cWe need to go back and you need to get inside this coat with me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s no way I\\u2019ll fit in there.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes you will. I wore this coat when I was pregnant. There\\u2019s definitely room for two people.\\u201d So I tell her to get in the coat and I put her arms in the same sleeves as my arms. Now I\\u2019ve got boots on and I tell her to step on top of my feet. She\\u2019s wooden though. I tell her, \\u201cLook, listen to this rhythm. 1, 2, 1, 2. Move your legs at the same time: 1, 2, 1, 2.\\u201d She starts to get it. Now I can hear music playing and I say, \\u201cOh! Do you know this song?\\u201d I think she might because it\\u2019s an older song. As I\\u2019m saying that, I realize there was old music that I don\\u2019t know but my parents would know playing in the background the whole time, but I didn't really notice. I wonder if they noticed. I look over at the owner and I say, \\u201cHey, you probably know this song.\\u201d He listens for a moment and says, \\u201cNo. What is it?\\u201d I tell him that it\\u2019s, \\u201cTwisting by the Pool\\u201d by Dire Straits. The music gets a little louder as though it warmed up to me recognizing it. I say, \\u201cLook, move to the rhythm of the music, 1, 2, 1, 2, twisting by the pool!\\u201d Now I\\u2019m singing it to her and I can feel her relaxing as she thaws out. She starts walking to the rhythm of the music and we\\u2019re okay. Now we\\u2019re trudging through the snow. The owner has a briefcase now and he starts picking up papers that are all over the snow. He\\u2019s putting the papers in his briefcase. He\\u2019s hurrying and trying to rush everyone into the store. I say, \\u201cit\\u2019s okay, I\\u2019ve got this. We\\u2019ll catch up with you later.\\u201d He says, \\u201cGood, because they\\u2019re supposed to be meeting me for dinner at my house and there\\u2019s wine.\\u201d The wine is really important. Now I\\u2019m feeling confused because I thought I was taking them back to the restaurant. He gives me the address and says, \\u201cYou need to bring them there. This is my house.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable again. I don\\u2019t really want to go to his house, but I have this woman I have to take there and I\\u2019m still wearing what I feel looks like pajamas. Now the dream starts to break down a bit. I\\u2019m intending to take them to his house and think I\\u2019ll end up going there.\"],[\"\\u201cWheat\\u201d I\\u2019m eating supper with my friend who is a dietician and her family. She has four kids and her husband is there, too. She\\u2019s describing to me the benefits of a plant based diet and invites me to stay for supper. I agree because I think it\\u2019s going to be all plant based food, but instead, she dishes out pasta like spaghetti that already has tomato sauce mixed in with it, and starts putting it on everybody\\u2019s plates. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you, I can\\u2019t eat wheat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, hmm, that\\u2019s all we have.\\u201d I say,\\u201dThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m used to not eating anything as opposed to eating wheat and suffering through the effects of it for weeks to come.\\u201d When her family is finished eating I notice that hardly any of her kids ate all the pasta. She just scrapes it all into the garbage. I wonder why she\\u2019s feeding her family stuff like this when she\\u2019s been advocating this plant based diet and also creating such waste. I find this puzzling.\"],[\"\\u201cWooden Ship\\u201d In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It\\u2019s between 40 and 60 feet long. It\\u2019s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he\\u2019s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it\\u2019s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It\\u2019s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It\\u2019s got debris filtered from the water as it\\u2019s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There\\u2019s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I\\u2019m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven\\u2019t gone all the way out into the body of water. We\\u2019re still going through the channel. I\\u2019m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: \\u201cRandy, it\\u2019s too shallow here, we\\u2019ll never make it through! We\\u2019re going to run aground!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, no, we\\u2019ll be fine. I\\u2019ve done this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s maneuvering the ship and I\\u2019m positive it\\u2019s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you\\u2019re going to scrape your keel. You\\u2019re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don\\u2019t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the ship just didn't run aground.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s because it has no keel.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! So how are we staying balanced?\\u201d Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it\\u2019s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, \\u201cOh, that explains that.\\u201d The dream speeds through the day on the water like it\\u2019s just a minute and we\\u2019re coming back through this same channel. Now it\\u2019s time to tie up. I\\u2019m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that\\u2019s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I\\u2019m climbing up, I realize it\\u2019s not attached to the wall and it\\u2019s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn\\u2019t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I\\u2019m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it\\u2019s a platform, like walking the plank. It\\u2019s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He\\u2019s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I\\u2019m okay. Now I\\u2019m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I\\u2019m standing there talking to him saying, \\u201cHow is this boat balanced without a keel?\\u201d He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it\\u2019s made of wood so it must be light plus it\\u2019s buoyant. There\\u2019s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It\\u2019s actually a hole. I\\u2019m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn\\u2019t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.\"],[\"1.

A man who runs with these animals has joined us and is running just behind me down the path. One of the animals falls but is able to get up and continue. Scene change. A group of people gather on a rooftop. They are making a temporary home each night on this roof, setting up tents, cooking food. A man who used to live in his van at the river is there. He now has a truck and it doesn\\u2019t appear that he lives in the truck, so I think he\\u2019s bought a house. But he is traveling with us.

I feel a little ashamed of my smaller one, but realize mine serves a purpose because it is smaller and more easily transported.\"],[\"A dream about where I used to live years ago\"],[\"A family member or myself contracted it. It was frightening and I was angry.\"],[\"A friend and I were using computers in a public place, like a library, and security guards unexpectedly began kicking us out of the place. They were super aggressive and violent, pushing us and destroying our property.

It made me feel unpleasant and I wasn't able to go back to sleep afterwards.\"],[\"A girl and two older women wait for a process to unfold\\u2026.It was taken over by other people, who are in charge of it now\\u2026.The women are impatient\\u2026.But I know they have to wait longer\\u2026.\"],[\"A group of people heard me reporting a crime to a group of police officers, and then those people attacked me.\"],[\"A group of young people is in trouble\\u2026.We are trying to get them help, but it is difficult\\u2026.Things we try do not work\\u2026.A woman is in charge\\u2026.I do what she says\\u2026.Something about a row of white boxes, are they big or numerous enough for what we need?....I am unsure\\u2026.\"],[\"A house is buried, covered in vines\\u2026.Can I help recover it?....it seems that some black people are inside the house, or they own it\\u2026Later, thinking of adding another story to a wooden house of mine\\u2026.To make it higher up\\u2026.But no, that would change the view of the building too much\\u2026.At the end, I am on a blue bicycle, riding up the hill on a street\\u2026.Cars to my left, one car stops in front of me, so I pedal around it to the left and pass it, then move back to the right curb side of the street\\u2026.A bold move by a biker, but I wanted to keep going faster than the car\\u2026.Now I realize I am going to try riding all the way up the street\\u2026.it is a flat area now, but more steep hills to come\\u2026.I wonder, will I be strong enough to ride all the way up, without walking the bike?....Yes, I am confident I can, I have done so before\\u2026.but it will be hard\\u2026.\"],[\"A journey to a house. I\\u2019m coming to a house from somewhere else. This house is huge and it\\u2019s quite grand, almost like a mansion but not quite as big. It\\u2019s very spacious and there is a lot of open space. The house is a house that someone is letting me and other people stay in. i\\u2019m the original person that the house owner let stay and I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m paying a really reduced rent or what. I\\u2019m the person whose name is on the lease or rental agreement. I have a bunch of other people living there with me because it\\u2019s a huge house. I\\u2019ve been on vacation somewhere and have just come back to the house. Josh is with me. He\\u2019s dragging his feet and is not excited about being back in this house. He keeps complaining about it not feeling like home and being too big. He\\u2019s also the only male in the house. The other people I\\u2019ve let the house out to are all women. When we walk in the door, there\\u2019s a bunch of women, all blonde and middle aged, very nice. They\\u2019re doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen area with the concrete countertops. It\\u2019s very open with windows that look out. I realize I have some things to clean up and am looking through drawers trying to find towels to mop up the mess. Then my friend, Nani from high school who I haven\\u2019t seen since she left high school her Junior year to move to California. She\\u2019s wandering around and is not talking a lot, she doesn\\u2019t have a whole lot to say. I go and follow her to the space she\\u2019s occupying. She\\u2019s taken up the den or the parlor. She\\u2019s put a bed in it and it\\u2019s super cute, I love the way she decorated it. It\\u2019s open to the rest of the house but you do have to go around a corner set of stairs to get to it. I\\u2019m wondering how she feels about not having a lot of privacy. I say hi to her and go back into the kitchen. Josh is there moping and sitting on the steps. The stairs are kind of crazy, a really big set of stairs with no railing on one side. You go up the stairs and hit a landing then turn and go up a second set of stairs. The second set of stairs is between two walls so there are rooms on either side at that point. The first part has no railing at all. We go up and our bedroom is up there. He\\u2019s sitting on the stairs and I think he comes up the stairs with me. I\\u2019m noticing as I go up into what would be our bedroom how empty it feels and it doesn\\u2019t actually feel like home. There are other bedrooms where other people are staying as well. The house is so big and it seems like it keeps getting bigger or there are more doors. I come back down the stairs and walk back through the kitchen and dining room area. The dining room has a big dining table and a big chandelier over the top. Off the dining room is another hallway and there are more rooms back there. We walk back there. This is where the two blonde ladies are saying, they have a space back here. It\\u2019s pretty comfortable. I\\u2019m looking and I realize the panel has a door and I suddenly see it. Josh is still moping somewhere and he\\u2019s on his phone and complaining about how he wants to go home or he wants to go where people know him. All I can think is we have this great place and there\\u2019s an adventure to be had because I just realized there\\u2019s a doorway into something else and he\\u2019s not ready. The words that keep coming through my head are, \\u201cYou\\u2019re just really immature and moping like a little boy so why don\\u2019t you do that because clearly you need to do that. I\\u2019m going in through this door to see what\\u2019s there.\\u201d I open up the door. Initially I just poke my head in to see what it is. I can see round hobbit doors and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is a portal into another realm, I can totally tell.\\u201d I look over my shoulder and see Josh being mopey and sad. I leave him and go in. it\\u2019s this hallway with all these doors off it and also a common area which is basically under where the stairs would be. The wood grain seems a bit shimmery and mirage-like. I walk in and run into all these women, but they\\u2019re not human. They\\u2019re all different kinds of fae. They\\u2019re talking to me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHi, I didn\\u2019t know this was here. Where is this? What is this? How are you staying at this house?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh we just rent with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d They\\u2019re super happy to show me the place. There\\u2019s nor weirdness about me as a human being there. One of them has bronze skin and curly hair, one of them has a baby. The one with a baby is the one who talks with me the most. She keeps dropping her baby. She sets him down and he sits for a little bit but then his head gets heavy and he flops over backwards. He nails his head on the floor which is concrete but he doesn\\u2019t cry. She just picks him up and sets him up again in another precarious position. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you want to put him there, he\\u2019s going to flop over again.\\u201d Sure enough he falls again and smacks his head really hard and fusses a little bit, but she calms him. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s good for him but she doesn\\u2019t seem concerned so I just leave it be. She\\u2019s the one who explains to me who they all are. She keeps calling herself and the other people/fae the name but I can\\u2019t pronounce it so I just forget. Then I start asking her, \\u201cWhat are you all doing here?\\u201d When I had walked from the dining into that back room the house started to feel weird and I told her, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s an entity in this house and I need to smudge and clear it out.\\u201d Now that I\\u2019m talking to this woman beneath the stairs in fae land or wherever I am, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yeah, we\\u2019re here because we keep that thing at bay. But you guys feel it more in that part of the house.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh well, how do I get rid of it? It doesn\\u2019t need to stay here and I know I can get rid of it. Whatever the dark pall that is hanging over the house just needs to go.\\u201d I think Josh is depressed and that\\u2019s part of why he\\u2019s depressed. She says, \\u201cOh well, you can clean it out, but we mostly do the work of keeping it out in here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay awesome. I\\u2019m still going to try and get rid of it because it\\u2019s not necessary and it doesn\\u2019t feel good and it makes the rest of the house feel really yucky and uncomfortable to be in.\\u201d Then the dream ends here because I don\\u2019t remember coming out of that part of the house, I think I just woke up. I have the sense that everything is okay and this part of the house is where I want to be and I don\\u2019t know if I want to return to the other side.\"],[\"A man in his car. He\\u2019s stoned. He\\u2019s found out that it\\u2019s illegal to possess any drugs here. He starts driving really, really fast. He drives into an ambush of men in army camouflage combat gear. They are pointing machine guns at him and shooting at him from all directions. Some are hiding high in trees, others in the grass, others standing, some crouching near and far. He is bloodied. He has a gun and is shooting at everybody. It\\u2019s a big, bloody, messy scene. Somehow he survives. He\\u2019s been making jewelry, amulets, very fine and delicate. Hidden inside of some of the amulets are drugs. There is a woman who is trying to uncover him and reveal his illegal activities. They\\u2019re at a fine cocktail or dinner party. People are holding his jewelry and admiring it. She\\u2019s trying to figure out who knows about the drugs. She\\u2019s closed out by everybody. Another scene: a forest, a large tree stump, wide and tall, about four and half feet tall and very wide. The stump is set up as an altar to Judas. I was going to do a ceremony for releasing the shame and betrayal of Judas. Ursula appears uninvited, adding things to the altar. Gemma appears with dried roses for the altar. Other women who were a part of the Priestess School who I don\\u2019t recognize arrive. I\\u2019m upset that they\\u2019re taking this ritual for themselves and somewhat including me but not acknowledging me.\"],[\"A new symptom started appearing in those with the virus, which was a rash.\"],[\"A really sinister feeling deram. I\\u2019m at a retreat center. The lodging is more like a dormitory, almost like Esalen with multiple bunk beds in each room. All the rooms are lined up in one long building. There\\u2019s a priest figure who\\u2019s either leading the retreat is a guru for this retreat center community. He\\u2019s a combination of different energies, including Swamiji. There are quite a few people gathered, some remind me of people from high school and others from college. There\\u2019s also my husband and me. My husband is upset and distant from me. He\\u2019s talking with other circles of people. I go into my room that I share with a group of people. I am witness to a murder and brainwashing. I\\u2019m not entirely brainwashed though, so I see it for what it is. It\\u2019s really disturbing. The priest is there. His assistant is with him. I feel sick to my stomach and don\\u2019t want to remember what I saw. They manipulate this young man, making him into a zombie-like state, then kiss all the life out of him. The people continue to do their things - folding clothes, brushing teeth, getting dressed. I hear the priest and his assistant talking about what to do with the body. The assistant says, \\u201cThis may have to be the last one for awhile because there might be some questions about the accident.\\u201d They plan to frame his death as a fall down the cliffs. I try to behave like the others to get away. I have a sense they\\u2019ve picked up on my more aware and attentive consciousness. I\\u2019m desperately looking for my husband to tell him because he\\u2019s one of the only ones I feel I can confide in now. I see him sitting on a bench with a small group of people. I want to draw him away so I can speak with him, but he doesn\\u2019t want to leave this group. He may somehow be involved with the deception somehow. The scene shifts. It seems like a month or so has passed. The same people are here. But now they are circulating around higher society at a symphony gala. They\\u2019re still doing the same sinister plotting and killing. Somehow they end up in the same location as me. I cross paths with them in the kitchen. More time has passed or maybe this is before. I\\u2019m going to a little library for a book reading and meditation. It\\u2019s in a neat geodesic dome. There\\u2019s an attic area upstairs with a woman who deceived my husband. The library has a collection of rare spiritual and magical books - not what you\\u2019d normally find in a library. This has been built as someone\\u2019s home and then later turned into a place for the public. I\\u2019m meeting with a small group of women. We\\u2019re sitting on the couch waiting for somebody. I recognize them from waking life, but they are distinctly different from their waking life appearance - shorter hair, heavier, odd voice, strange style of dress. They decide to begin. Usually I\\u2019m the one to begin, but Beth and Sherry begin instead. Beth takes out a long curved brown dried leaf with an incense stick and a white piece of copal. But then Shnati smiles and pops the copal in her mouth like a piece of candy. They light the incense and begin. Somebody sings a song. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m setting up a beach blanket with my mom, sister and son. It\\u2019s a lovely day. I\\u2019m watching a young Indian mother and her child play in the water. She\\u2019s round and full in her body, so is he. They go out into the waves during a lull. Others are swimming in the water. Then suddenly a big wave rises up out of the ocean. The wave swallows the mother and son, then it rushes up to our towel. It washes my Kindle away along with my bags, shoes and son. I\\u2019m scrambling waiting for the waves to calm so I can find everything and hoping the water returns it all. My son is okay. My Kindle is buried partially under the sand, still in its case. It\\u2019s okay. We move our towels up where there is a young gay couple on their towel. We\\u2019re close to them, but we will all move soon and have more space between us.\"],[\"A store after hours. It\\u2019s been closed for a while now. People are gathering here at night, unlocking the door and huddling close inside. Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I\\u2019m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I\\u2019m not really welcome because I\\u2019m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won\\u2019t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I\\u2019m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.\"],[\"A white guy has a bunch of black bugs on his face\\u2026.I see as he leans over close to me\\u2026.This is part of a bigger cleaning process, it is good he is doing this, allowing the bugs to be on his face, this will make it easier to get rid of them\\u2026.I admire him, even though it is gross, I want him to stay away\\u2026.\"],[\"A white room. My ex Rory was outside the door and I was inside. I was creating art or something on the floor. I had pot that was spilling everywhere and red wine, but I didn\\u2019t want him to see it.

It was matter of fact. I could be where I was and be experiencing what they were experiencing. I was just experiencing people.

At one point, she\\u2019s in a smaller room. I hear her say that she pooped and a woman says, \\u201cgood, this is great, this is part of it.\\u201d Then another woman who sounds like my mother shames her for pooping. She says it\\u2019s not a good thing. I wish I was there to be another voice of support. She comes out of that room, clean and very much in the fire of crowning birth. I can see a redness and opening between her legs. She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We\\u2019re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She\\u2019s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby.

A journey over the ocean or maybe just a bay. Salt water. I\\u2019m watching a person who has never captained a boat. They are gathering a crew. I know the end of the story. The chosen captain doesn\\u2019t survive the journey. I\\u2019m watching to see how this happens, wondering if the captain is murdered or dies of natural causes or has an accident of some kind. The crew is assembled. The boat is beautiful but totally empty. We all get on the boat. As the people move up and down the different levels of the boat, I'm peering through windows. There are people carrying small lanterns to light their way, others writing in journals, others sleeping, others watching the stars. I\\u2019m waiting to see where the captain is going and what will happen to the captain. Maybe by watching, it may shift the way things develop. Maybe the captain will survive. But there is no way to know. Then, a bathtub with a little girl in the tub, prepubescent, learning about puberty. Hanna is in one room. Rose is in another room. Another woman is also present. Hanna is very light in her questioning. Rose is very certain in her teaching, talking about the first blood and how to measure a ship to be as clear as possible from the beginning. Do we measure from end to end, or only the livable portion of a ship? She\\u2019s talking about how to maintain and care for the pubic hair without having razor bumps. Rose says, \\u201cWell, of course you massage first for a while.\\u201d She says this as if everyone should know.

There\\u2019s a feeling of conflict, misunderstanding, fear, manipulation, and yet an attempt at forming a common goal - a goal of learning then teaching. The power goes out in the building. Then, we\\u2019re in the hallway sweeping up dirt and hair that has fallen off people\\u2019s heads over the years. In another room, a class is beginning. Someone hands me an amulet of lava stone with red jewels and hammered iron. I wear it during the class. The class is a movement almost like yoga. I wear the amulet to charge it with power.

We\\u2019re driving and we pull over because someone has to use the bathroom. We\\u2019re in the mountains and we find a rest stop. At the rest stop are a bunch of cattle and they\\u2019re all having babies. It\\u2019s funny because they aren\\u2019t standing up and birthing. They\\u2019ve dug holes and are dropping the babies into holes. Ana\\u2019s son is watching the whole thing and so am I. We are completely fascinated by all this birth happening all around us. The dream switches. Now I\\u2019m with my dad, siblings, and kids. We\\u2019re in a place that kind of reminds me of a Chinatown. We\\u2019re trying to find someplace to eat. We\\u2019re walking down the street and there are a lot of options. I think it\\u2019s during pandemic times because everyone has masks on and there are not a lot of places open. This part of the dream gets kind of fuzzy. I don\\u2019t know exactly what we\\u2019re going after. Funny things are happening at the restaurant when we go to order. I\\u2019m not hungry because there\\u2019s food I can\\u2019t eat. Then we find this other stand and the kitchen is gross with cockroaches everywhere and the smell of rancid oil. Then the dream switches. I am with a group of people. I only recognize one person and it\\u2019s my high school classmate. We\\u2019re a bunch of high schoolers. We\\u2019re at horse stables. There\\u2019s a European woman with an accent. She\\u2019s teaching us how to be around horses. First she does a demonstration in the arena. All of the horses are black. She\\u2019s riding the horse with no saddle, no bit, no reins. She\\u2019s showing us how to ride, basically dressage. She\\u2019s showing us and saying, \\u201cThis is very easy.\\u201d I\\u2019m talking to the group and am like, \\u201cNone of that is easy. I\\u2019ve done dressage and it\\u2019s not easy to get a horse to do perfect gaits and stop on perfect points, especially without a saddle and bit.\\u201d The woman comes out and says, \\u201cOkay, now it\\u2019s your turn.\\u201d Everyone files into the arena. At the far end is a stable with like twenty black horses. Everyone goes and gets a horse. I\\u2019m actually excited about being around the horses, but for some reason I don\\u2019t go out right away. All these classmates of mine have horses. They\\u2019re doing the hand motions that she\\u2019s showing them. There are a bunch of other trainers, men, who are keeping an eye on everyone. I\\u2019m horrified now because it\\u2019s so crowded and it\\u2019s so loud and there\\u2019s no way in hell any horse would stand there for all this noise, chaos and inexperienced people trying to get them to do things. I think the horses are put away and it\\u2019s time for us to stretch. We\\u2019re sitting in the dirt of the arena. They\\u2019re asking me how to stretch the pelvis. I\\u2019m showing them how to do a straddle and rock the pelvis forward. A man walks by and I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s our teacher or a trainer or a chaperone. He takes over from me and shows everyone how to do different stretches. Everyone follows along. Our low backs get stretched. I\\u2019m folded all the way over with my head resting on my legs and thinking, \\u201cWow, my low back has never been this flexible. Huh.\\u201d Then the dream switches again. I\\u2019m parked somewhere. I leave my car to go do something. When I come back, my ex-boyfriend is parked next to me. He\\u2019s parked crooked so I can\\u2019t open the passenger side door if I wanted to. In fact, I don\\u2019t know how he\\u2019s getting out of the car because he hasn\\u2019t left himself very much room. He gets out and he has all his stuff and he\\u2019s super happy to see me. I\\u2019m shocked and have no idea why he\\u2019s there. He walks around and puts his stuff in the back seat of my car and says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? Why are you here and what are we doing?\\u201d I have no idea how we\\u2019re suddenly here together in a parking lot in a tropical space. He says, \\u201cCome, I want to show you this island.\\u201d It\\u2019s an island where people have to boat out to live there. All the houses are gigantic. There\\u2019s an estuary that cuts the island in half so salt water flows from one end of the island to the other. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis island gets demolished by a hurricane.\\u201d It\\u2019s tropical. There\\u2019s a mix of super rich and super poor people. As we float down this center estuary I\\u2019m noticing huge houses and a huge building for a swap meet with secondhand stuff because everyone on the island reuses everything. I go into that building and look at all the items in the swap meet. I\\u2019m watching an old guy haggle for a tablecloth. The tablecloth has a stain on it and the woman who owns the place is like, \\u201cNo no, let me find you another one.\\u201d She goes off to find him another one. I\\u2019m wandering through and see a bunch of old Christmas decorations. I\\u2019m laughing and like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re on an island, who\\u2019s going to do anything with these? No one. Why are they all here? It\\u2019s junk.\\u201d I leave this area and decide to fly. My body is flying so I can see the rest of the island. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I can see green everywhere and tropical plants. It\\u2019s not a problem to fly. I\\u2019m watching people scaling cliffs and kayaking through the river. It\\u2019s paradise. The water is a beautiful crystal blue. I have no idea what happened to my ex-boyfriend, he disappeared from the dream at some point. Then at one point, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHuh, I don\\u2019t think I want to fly because I could crash land.\\u201d I remind myself that I won\\u2019t crash, though, and I\\u2019ll be fine. The dream ends with me flying over the whole island, taking it in and knowing it\\u2019s about to be wrecked by a hurricane.\"],[\"Anger at the President and his administration for having zero sense of urgency, human compassion, or empathy while tens of thousands are sick or dying - in the US and around the world.\"],[\"Angry dream of long time friend who has added to my stress level with herself-centered, judgmental, sarcastic attitude.I dream In my dream her physical appearance is childish.\"],[\"Animated movies consistently give me nightmares.

I pul us in and lose the door and it secures. We just make it as this wave goes by. I notice when we\\u2019re in there that there are no windows and I guess this is why we were safe.

I do not have a body, I am not taking up any space, I am just watching it all happen. There is a black man and his two daughters. He is showing them how to ride trains for free because they\\u2019re really poor and they don\\u2019t have money for a ticket. So he showed them how to get on these subway trains for free and ride where you need to ride it. They\\u2019re riding on the outside of the train. His daughters are maybe 9 and 11 or maybe 11 or 14. I\\u2019m watching them. I\\u2019m not even on the train. I\\u2019m watching from outside the train. This train is underground, kind of like a subway because there are walls around it and me. They\\u2019re on this train and it\\u2019s going in one direction. They are on a trip and traveling cross-country. But his daughters get very fearless and bold. They decide to do train hopping and take what he\\u2019s taught them and get on any train they want. Sure enough, they\\u2019re on this train and they see another train passing them and going in the opposite direction. They were heading one direction because they were heading across the country and then the daughters hop trains and the father is upset. He says, \\u201cHey don\\u2019t do that, now we\\u2019re going in the wrong direction plus you could kill yourselves.\\u201d But it\\u2019s too late. The daughters are already on another train, so he has to hop it and get on with them, so he doesn\\u2019t lose them. So he gets on this other train. Now they go from being on top of the train down inside the train where there\\u2019s other people. There are all kinds of other people on this train. All kinds of ethnicities, races. It\\u2019s a mix of white, black, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander - everybody and all kinds. They\\u2019re all quirky people. They have their own idiosyncrasies. They\\u2019re each working through some sort of story - they\\u2019re living their own personal story out on this train and they\\u2019re kind of interacting with each other, but it\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re bouncing off of each other. The interactions aren\\u2019t particularly conscious. It\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re each doing their own thing. They run into each other and it\\u2019s sort of like a pinball where their actions, thoughts and stories are mainly about themselves, but they bounce off each other and have an interaction. In particular, there\\u2019s a couple that I can see and am following - a white man with a mustache and shorter hair and with his partner/wife - I can\\u2019t tell what kind of relationship they\\u2019re in. The dad and the two daughters are in the mix now. I\\u2019m watching them. Now that the direction they\\u2019re going has now changed completely, he\\u2019s realizing they need clothes and supplies and food. They\\u2019re going around the train and getting some supplies. Everybody is pretty friendly and are like, \\u201cYeah, we all don\\u2019t have a lot, but here I have this one coat or this shirt.\\u201d It seems like everybody on this train doesn\\u2019t have a lot of money, but they do have some resources. Everything they\\u2019re offering up has been well-used. But the daughters need clothes, shoes and food. And the dad\\u2019s like, yeah I could use a jacket. So everybody is offering what they\\u2019ve got. Then back to this one man with this woman. He\\u2019s wearing a flannel shirt that\\u2019s opened and jeans with rips. He knows what he\\u2019s wanting to do - he\\u2019s very focused. The train has now gone out from a tunnel to outside. I can see outside now. I\\u2019m in the train and outside the train, both simultaneously. I\\u2019m observing what\\u2019s happening in the train and outside of the train. So the train is outside and stops suddenly. Part of the tracks go through this person\\u2019s yard. Their yard looks like a big farm. The train dead stops in the middle. My thought when I see that is, \\u201cUgh, how inconvenient to have a train in the middle of your front lawn. Then all the people start getting off the train. They\\u2019re milling about the lawn of this farm. It\\u2019s a big property. Then some of the people are going into the farmhouse and I\\u2019m watching them wondering, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s the owner of this house? They're probably not going to like this.\\u201d Then that one man and the woman go into the house and they start looking for supplies. I see this other man, he\\u2019s a big beefy burly man, almost like a bodybuilder type guy. He\\u2019s with a woman, too, and she\\u2019s really big, maybe 200lbs and she has a backpack on. They see that the farmer has a horse that\\u2019s in the front lawn and they climb up on the horse to ride it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that horse\\u2019s back is going to break. That\\u2019s too much weight - bodybuilder, large woman plus backpack.\\u201d I see the horse walking, then trotting, then galloping. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d The horse is fighting the whole time. The farmer comes out and yells at them to get off his horse, which is something I would have done. But the thought that registers in my brain is: \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe they know how to ride a horse.\\u201d With the whole bodybuilding persona, it doesn\\u2019t seem like something they would know how to do. Then I go back to the inside of this house where this other man is - the one with the mustache. He has found jewelry making supplies and he\\u2019s making jewelry. It\\u2019s gorgeous, raw stones and he\\u2019s soldering the silver. He\\u2019s making a pendant. It\\u2019s not his supplies, but the farmer\\u2019s that he found in this house. I can see this happening through a sliding glass door. Then I am inside the house. This black man and his daughters are in there, too, and they\\u2019re rummaging for food. The other people on the train are milling about, too, doing all kinds of things. The train has stopped because it\\u2019s stuck. But eventually, you hear the conductor yelling, \\u201cHey, the train is back together. You need to get on. We\\u2019re going to go. We\\u2019re going to continue on.\\u201d So some of the people get back on the train, and some of the people are like, \\u201cNo, we like it here. We\\u2019re going to stay here.\\u201d (not necessarily in the farmhouse, but in this area). The train continues on in its direction while another train passes in the opposite direction. I think the black man and his daughters get on the train going the opposite direction so they can get back to where they had originally set out to go to. Then the dream switches completely. Again I am an observer. I\\u2019m watching women I know - they are performers. It\\u2019s kind of like a circus. There\\u2019s a big tent. They\\u2019re in a dressing room in the back where everyone is talking. There\\u2019s lots of love and connection between all these women. They\\u2019re definitely family, they get along, some are actually blood family. It\\u2019s not a hierarchy because not just one person is in charge, but there is a synergy with one person who directs things. Things get done around her direction, but nobody has more or less power than her. This is fascinating for me to watch as she gives directions about how to do their show. It\\u2019s not actually directions. She\\u2019s asking who wants to do what - \\u201cDo you want to do this part of the show? Are we going to take a break?\\u201d Then there is an announcement that this man is coming in and he\\u2019s going to be a guest spot and do part of the show. I see all of the women perk up. Some are like, \\u201cWell, is he handsome?\\u201d But I see the woman who is the glue and directs things. She gets that look in her eye like, \\u201cHmm, I don\\u2019t know if I trust this.\\u201d So everybody leaves the dressing room and goes out in the circus tent area where there\\u2019s definitely a crowd of people watching. They\\u2019re watching a show in a huge copper bathtub, big enough for multiple people to be in. The man comes in and he\\u2019s going to do his show in the bathtub. It reminds me of synchronized swimming and people who act like mermaids, so you can watch through the glass as they do this show under the water. So this man is doing all of it, but normally the show is done completely naked - all of the women are completely naked while they do it. He\\u2019s doing it with his clothes on and the women are wondering, \\u201cWhat is going on? Why is he doing it that way?\\u201d So the woman who directs and has some good mothering energy goes into the tub to do part of the show and she\\u2019s naked as usual. The man who has all of his clothes on has an assistant and she has all her clothes on, too. The woman that is directing things goes in and does her part. You can tell there is tension and this attempted shaming that she\\u2019s in there naked. It\\u2019s totally beautiful to watch her, but then there\\u2019s this man and this other woman who have their clothes. They look so weird, they can barely move because their clothes are dragging them down, especially in contrast to the woman who\\u2019s naked. Some of the other women come in and start doing the dance in the water and they\\u2019re naked. But then you see some sort of official come in and say, \\u201cYou have to wear clothes now.\\u201d So they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, we have to put our clothes on.\\u201d They do put their clothes on. The person who says, \\u201cyou have to put your clothes on\\u201d is the husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing things. He says it because he says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t dance with that man naked,\\u201d because now in the show, they\\u2019re supposed to dance together. The husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing the show is feeling jealousy or protectiveness and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t dance with him without your clothes on. You all put your clothes on.\\u201d So there\\u2019s this dynamic of men coming in and directing the woman and their dancing, nakedness, wildness and freeness.\"],[\"Dreamt about being in quarantine on multiple occasions and having to tell my partner I was diagnosed with COVID-19\"],[\"dreamt about finding a special type of facemask that I was able to wear comfortably (seriously happened)\"],[\"Dreamt I was in a very strange house.

There are big circular plates of a frittata like food with some light purple-pink sauce poured on top. There is an order for who is to get the food first, but there are mothers of young children who are pushing to the front and making a mess of things with their plates. They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates.

We are walking in the dark. I have to pick up something for my mom. We\\u2019re wandering along a street. We end up at an old lover\\u2019s house where he is hosting a weekly meeting. The door is painted pink. I slip in first without knocking and go to the bathroom. The toilet is light pink and purple. When I flush, there\\u2019s slime in the toilet. I wash my hands and step out. Other people are arriving and are happy to be here. I\\u2019m a bit embarrassed. We leave. We\\u2019re in a big room in another house. Shoes are for sale here. Naseem needs new shoes. She wants a pair of tall red boots. There are also a lot of light purple boots. She thinks she can take them and walk out, but there are only single boots. She needs to find a full set but can\\u2019t. She would have to get help from a cashier but she doesn\\u2019t have the money to pay. She was hoping to just get what she wanted and walk out without paying. As she is trying a pair of purple boots, another box magically opens and there is a matched pair in the box. Naseem then pulls me into the bathroom to show me someone in there. A friend I used to dance with in college is on the floor of the bathroom, lying in a really odd pose, face down, back arched, one leg kicked out to the side. Naseem is concerned about her. I say she\\u2019s just choreographing a contemporary dance. I ask her if I can join even though it\\u2019s been so long since I\\u2019ve danced. She says yes.

I begged to be allowed to go aboard just one of the ships I'd paid for, so I could bring back antibiotics to help people, but since the ships were quarantined, I wasn't allowed. Essentially, I had it within my power to stop the ever increasing deaths, but wasn't allowed to access the supplies I'd had brought in to do it. The outbreak got worse and worse, there were dead lying in the streets to be collected and buried in pits, and I was despondent, as several new ships full of antibiotics came in each day, full of enough medicine to cure the outbreak, but just sat in quarantine.\"],[\"Had a dream about being in a romcom with Mathew McConaughey, some silly misunderstanding about a wedding, probably about The Wedding Planner movie w JLo\"],[\"Had a dream about being in car accident & Blake Shelton said \\\"don't worry Sis, I'll pull you out\\\" and did.

This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I\\u2019m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he\\u2019s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he\\u2019s talking with me and he\\u2019s trying to court me. He\\u2019s showing me all the things he\\u2019s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he\\u2019s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he\\u2019s done, he\\u2019s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it\\u2019s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He\\u2019s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It\\u2019s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I\\u2019m in my home now - it\\u2019s not very descriptive, I just know I\\u2019m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn\\u2019t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That\\u2019s my first \\u201coh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn\\u2019t look very safe. She\\u2019s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it\\u2019s falling out. There\\u2019s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it\\u2019s also filthy. She\\u2019s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I\\u2019m offering to make them a meal - I guess they\\u2019re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she\\u2019s wild. She doesn\\u2019t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He\\u2019s just telling her what to do. He\\u2019s literally telling her: \\u201cOkay, now do this, do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s so proud of himself. He thinks he\\u2019s being the best dad. I\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god, your daughter is wrecked.\\u201d I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I\\u2019m with the next man in the lineup. It\\u2019s my ex-husband. He\\u2019s different. He\\u2019s also trying to show me how different he is. He\\u2019s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We\\u2019re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There\\u2019s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we\\u2019re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I\\u2019m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I\\u2019m really excited for their blind date. I\\u2019m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we\\u2019re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they\\u2019re snuggling up. I\\u2019m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it\\u2019s cute, it\\u2019s sweet. There\\u2019s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it\\u2019s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there\\u2019s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: \\u201cCan she do it? Is she strong enough?\\u201d Since he\\u2019s already over my back, he\\u2019s essentially in the fireman\\u2019s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\\u2019t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.\\u201d I realize that that\\u2019s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I\\u2019m with the next man. It\\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you\\u2019re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He\\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We\\u2019re hanging out and i\\u2019s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there\\u2019s also different types of equipment around, too. There\\u2019s these three younger men and they\\u2019re teachers or they\\u2019re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: \\u201cOh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.\\u201d So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We\\u2019ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He\\u2019s so attentive and affectionate. He\\u2019s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he\\u2019s getting agitated and I think that\\u2019s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn\\u2019t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken\\u2019s hat and I\\u2019d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He\\u2019s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5\\u20196\\u201d, I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d and Luke\\u2019s about 6\\u20192\\u201d or 3\\u201d or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It\\u2019s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I\\u2019ve seen you strip.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? I\\u2019ve been stripping?!\\u201d Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, \\u201cOh yeah, I totally did that, but don\\u2019t know what it was for.\\u201d Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you\\u2019re amazing and I didn\\u2019t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, \\u201cWhat, do you think you want my hat back now?\\u201d He\\u2019s saying this like he\\u2019s not going to give it to me and I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m like whatever. I hadn\\u2019t thought of it and it\\u2019s not a big deal to me. We\\u2019re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We\\u2019re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he\\u2019s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it\\u2019s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it\\u2019s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I\\u2019m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he\\u2019s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to be a part of any of them.

It was silent.\"],[\"I am a passenger in a vehicle of some kind, I think it\\u2019s a train. I\\u2019m with other people and we are looking for our home. It\\u2019s night outside. We\\u2019re going past some pick-yards filled with old smashed up cars. Then we end up at a huge mansion in this cute little town. We walk in because it is our new home. I am most impressed with the kitchen. I love it because there are three different sitting choices - a half moon table at the end of the island with a couple chairs; a longer rectangle dark wood table for 6; and a pretty shiny off-white round breakfast nook with soft pillows on the two benches. To the right of the kitchen is a big formal sitting room and dining area. The dining table is large and gleaming white. It only sits 4. The chairs have mossy soft green cushions and the place settings are lovely - silver and cream with gold, soft green napkins. There is a fireplace with antlers on the mantel. It\\u2019s very nice, elegant, cozy and inviting. Off to the side of this large room is a small library/consultation room. Later in the dream, my mom has returned from a trip into town. She has a towel wrapped around her head as if she\\u2019s just come out of the shower. She is having a counseling consultation with a woman. The house is surrounded by a lot of space. I\\u2019m walking with my friend and housemate (I don\\u2019t recognize her from waking life). She steps on a dry place with branches and fallen leaves. The ground gives way a bit and we look at each other, astonished, and I tell her: \\u201cKeep walking!\\u201d As she keeps carefully walking, the ground continues to give way and we see that it is a mote without any water in it. The mote was dug around this house many many years ago. We are astonished. We look at each other and remember: We\\u2019ve lived in this home in a past life. This house has always been in our family and it is right that we have returned. So we continue to walk, moving the ground away with our steps and remembering/revealing this mote. Now I have to go into town for an errand. I\\u2019m a passenger in a car. The town reminds me of the outer parts of San Francisco where I used to live. I\\u2019m going to meet people for ice cream. At first I just order a regular ice cream cone. But then I see that the other people have chosen a crispy cookie cone. When I look at theirs, I want it because mine is just this soggy flour burrito wrap. I ask for the crispy cookie cone and they look at the board to calculate the cost. My order comes with four layers and each cone is $3, so it will be an additional $12. I think that\\u2019s too expensive and just take the regular one. It\\u2019s not very appetizing and I don\\u2019t love it but I eat it anyway. Now I\\u2019m being driven back with a realtor and I look out to see the windmill - it has been lit up with white lights and is sparkling and beautiful against the night sky and dark ocean. The realtor points out that they had to take away all the historic sculptures from the beach because the big giant peach was cracked and needed to be renovated. So they decided to renovate all the pieces that used to be in the carnival at the beach. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s sad they had to take those away.\\u201d I look out the window to the left and see that a house has been torn down. But they\\u2019re building a new house out of bottle caps. I\\u2019m amazed at this bottle cap house. On the way back to the house, we see a wonderful field and imagine going there to play and eat lunch.

The couple who own the home are getting a divorce. He\\u2019s not there. She is there and she has arranged her whole wardrobe out of the closets, arranging the clothing by style and function. It\\u2019s some kind of estate sale. I\\u2019m looking at a rack of clothes with an older Chinese woman and the woman who owns the house. The owner is holding out a nice little dress suit for the Chinese woman who is kind of interested. She puts it on, but then takes off the short sleeved blouse/jacket and is really excited about the sexy strappy dress underneath. She keeps looking at the clothes and is pulling out the tight form-fitting strappy dresses. We all think it\\u2019s pretty cute that she likes this sexy style. I\\u2019m looking at beautiful sexy lingerie. I try on one and love it and another one that I also love. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s still in its packaging. I hold it up against my body and the lady of the house is nodding her head in approval. I decide to take all of them. Later in the dream, the man of the house is coming home. Rose and I are performing for him individually. He will choose which one of us he prefers. I do this beautiful sensual presentation that is soft and gently inviting. Then Rose does this wildly evocative and erotic demonstration that is outwardly very sexy. I\\u2019m sure he is going to choose her especially because she is so tall and gorgeous. His assistant nods at me and has me wait. He leaves and comes back a while later. He is ascending the stairs with two bunches of wild roses of pastel colors wrapped in brown paper. He gives them to me. He has chosen me.\"],[\"I am at a cafe waiting for friends to arrive. It is raining outside. We are talking about how some of our friends were just in a television series. They will be invited to a feature release party. I see a friend arrive. She wants a table where she can see the entire cafe and all the people. We order our tea then go sit at our table to wait. After we finish our tea, we leave and get in a car with a bunch of people. My parents are with us. We drive to a slaughtering lot. I see a hide of a mother cow hanging from a hook - they milked her completely dry then exploded her. There are cows, sheep, pigs and goats on conveyor belts, packed closely together and lined up for their death, but they aren\\u2019t being killed for food or any other useful purpose. They are lined up from smallest to largest. We are on a private tour and I\\u2019m watching these animals going past me on the belt. There are horses, cows, then elephants. I\\u2019m shocked at seeing a big pink pig with tusks next to an elephant - the same size as the elephant. It\\u2019s depressing to see all of this. I continue walking up a ramp. I go into an upper room and see lambs and baby unicorns. They have IV tubes wrapped around their legs - they are either being poisoned or resuscitated, I cannot tell. They do look sickly. Someone comes in and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019ve found the babies! I hope you are enjoying your tour!\\u201d I\\u2019m watching as these clusters of unicorns play together, but they do not look well. I walk out the door and down a ramp. I am looking out over the whole lot. It\\u2019s unusual and depressing. Then I see these huge crystal geodes that are partially submerged in the ocean - they\\u2019re purpose is to be amphitheaters for shows. We have each been assigned one to represent our energies. I see the one given to me. It is a beautiful blue and lit up with symbols on the inside. It is called The Dreamer\\u2019s Cave. We are being prepared for our amphitheaters and given massage oils to anoint our bodies. Mine is mixed with wild orange, but I am upset because it is not the right one.\"],[\"I am at a dance rehearsal. It\\u2019s the first rehearsal, so we are just learning the choreography. It\\u2019s really beautiful and dynamic with lots of interactions and refined contact improv. It is mostly men with just a few women. Then we all fall to the ground. We\\u2019re waiting for the next instructions. I\\u2019m next to my friend George - he\\u2019s gay and black. I look around through slitted eyes because we\\u2019re supposed to have our eyes closed. The choreographer instructs us that in the next few moments we are going to sit up and kiss people. This is a necessary part if we are going to remain in the cast. I\\u2019m not pleased about this. George whispers to me that now is my opportunity to get out. Somehow he slips away. The rest of us sit up and before I know what's happening an Asian man has pulled me into an embrace. His eyes don\\u2019t converge and it\\u2019s unsettling. One eye looks up and the other eye looks past me. He pulls me and I can feel him grab my lip with his teeth. I don't like it, but it\\u2019s not too awful. He continues to kiss and I try to kiss back because it\\u2019s what I\\u2019m expected to do. Then I feel his hand reach up to touch my nipple and I\\u2019m horrified by it. It feels awful. I hate it because I\\u2019m still so sensitive from nursing. So I push him away and think, \\u201cFuck this, I\\u2019m not staying for this no matter what.\\u201d I quickly walk away and am in a library. It\\u2019s dark, no lights on. I\\u2019m wandering around as if it were a maze, and I\\u2019m trying to get lost so they can\\u2019t find me. In one aisle, I hear them talking about how I just got up and left without explanation and I need to come back. I\\u2019m wearing my fitted dance clothes. I notice in my hand a big wad of paper towels. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with it because I don\\u2019t want to hold it or be found with it. I don\\u2019t have a pocket. I also don\\u2019t want to leave it on a bookshelf and there are no rubbish containers. I try to tuck it into my hair to hide it.\"],[\"I am at a Parks and Rec facility with a couple pools, workout rooms with stationary bikes and rooms upstairs for group classes. There\\u2019s a place on the farside of the pool where a man makes scones and homemade soaps and also sells produce. I get a job at the Rec Facility cleaning up. I\\u2019m at the side of the pool, pulling in the lane ropes out of the water and to the side of the pool. There are still people in the water. A man comes and is completely bald. He has a lot of vitality about him and is charming and warm. I can tell by the way he carries himself that he is a man of great wealth. He asks if he can help me and I tell him I don\\u2019t need help. I continue on with my work. He stays nearby, but is not lurking, just looking around. Then I go through the glass doors. There are bikes on display that are for sale. People have gathered to see a demonstration of a new bike. A man comes up from the crowd to help pull ropes and gears from under the ground to the stage to help demonstrate what this new bike can do. We\\u2019re all watching and waiting. This bike is expensive and the technology is quite advanced. The charming and beautiful bald man is standing next to me and after watching for a bit, he decides to buy a bike without knowing or asking the cost. I observe that he must be quite wealthy. Then, I am standing in line for my daily scone. He is with me and stands in line behind me. He is asking me about the scones, soap and produce. I tell him about how wonderful it all is. People pre-order scones, so they are guaranteed a scone each day, but there is a small selection of scones available. He steps up to the counter and orders 5 scones for both of us to share. The flavors are sophisticated, two pink ones with cardamom and peppercorn, two chocolate, and a plain one. The pink and chocolate scones are on a higher plate, and the icing drizzles down to the plain one. They look delicious. I\\u2019m looking through my credit cards, trying to find a specific one, but as I look, more cards seem to appear. I\\u2019m squinting at the cards because I can\\u2019t read them well. There are so many credit and debit cards, and I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with them. But he pays, so I put my cards away.\"],[\"I am at my place of work and I really enjoy where I am. It has a really bright and light feeling. I can\\u2019t see exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I can\\u2019t exactly see the people around me, but I know I like them and I know that where I am feels really good. I feel like I have purpose. I feel very open and excited to do it. I have two other work engagements and I\\u2019m not as excited about either of those, but I know it\\u2019s time for me to move to my second job, so I leave this light and bright place. I go into this hardware store that\\u2019s kind of dingy and smells metallic like hardware stores do with the little mix of oil. It\\u2019s very dim lighting with fluorescent lights over the top hanging low in the ceiling but only half of them work. I can\\u2019t tell exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I think I\\u2019m organizing nuts and bolts or cleaning something out. I know I\\u2019m greasy and dirty. The woman I\\u2019m working for, the owner, is there. She\\u2019s a mother and she has these two boys that aren\\u2019t hers but they\\u2019re in her care somehow. She also has a baby with her and at one point the baby is needing care and she has a fish she\\u2019s caught. The fish needs to be filleted and cooked and somehow I\\u2019m the one who knows how to do that. So I fillet the fish and I can see the individual muscles - the layers - the way a fish fillet is layered. The baby seems to be sickly and crying and is sitting in a carrier to my right. I fillet this fish and cook it and then take one of the layers off and give it to the baby to eat. This baby seems to be 5 or 6 months old, so it seems kind of strange that I\\u2019m giving it fish, but it seems to be what it needs. There\\u2019s this overall air of sadness and grief, like this baby is going to die anyway even if I give it this nourishing fish. Then I\\u2019m back speaking with the mother and she\\u2019s asking me to keep an eye on her two boys that aren\\u2019t really hers, but she\\u2019s taking care of. I go with the boys to her house. One boy goes in the house and stays in the house and one boy stays out. They\\u2019re twins and one is not allowed inside the house, the other is. The father doesn\\u2019t let the other one in. I\\u2019m watching the two of them and as I\\u2019m watching one boy cross over this threshold and the other stay behind, this group or gang of boys from the neighborhood come. They have some sort of laundry detergent or white powder they\\u2019ve picked up from the hardware store. They throw it into the eyes of both of the boys because neither of the boys are really the children of the family - that seems to be the reason anyway. The one boy who\\u2019s allowed in the house starts to cry and he\\u2019s screaming and he\\u2019s trying to clean the powder off his face. He gets taken care of - someone in the house takes care of him, washes his eyes out. The boy that\\u2019s not allowed in the house is crying and screaming and I go to take care of him. But I\\u2019m not allowed to take care of him. Someone else is taking him. And now some time has passed and I\\u2019m standing in the bedroom - it\\u2019s an upstairs bedroom. I\\u2019m looking out the window, and to my left is the boy allowed in the house. He\\u2019s on the bed and has bandages over his eyes. As I\\u2019m looking out this second or third story window, I\\u2019m looking out at this outdoor shed or barn and it has a huge human size cage hanging from it and the other boy is in it and his eyes are bandaged. It looks like they tried to make it comfortable for him to lay down, but it is a wire cage that\\u2019s rested. He\\u2019s lying down trying to convalesce. Then all of a sudden I remember I still never went to my third job, which was working for my mother, and I really don\\u2019t want to do that. She has been calling me this whole time reminding me that I owed her - that I was supposed to show up, that I\\u2019m supposed to be there, that I\\u2019m supposed to do this work for her. I would answer the call and talk to her, then put the phone down and promptly forget that I was supposed to be there. And now it\\u2019s time for me to go and I don\\u2019t go. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I am at the house of my friend/boss. I'm trying to find a place to put a piano so I can learn to play it. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding a wall to put it against or just a spot to have it. It needs a plug and I can\\u2019t find a plug. I\\u2019m brainstorming and talking out loud with myself and with her to try and get this piano put someplace. But it\\u2019s her house, so I have this feeling of reservation because I need to get her permission. It feels a bit awkward because I don\\u2019t think she needs the piano. She\\u2019s also my boss and I\\u2019m fucking around with this piano thing, but there is work I need to be doing, so that feels a bit odd. It\\u2019s also quarantine time like now, but more apocalyptic feeling. My attention moves on from the piano and the headlines are pretty dire with deaths and whatnot. I\\u2019m also reading the astrology and getting the astrology report - it was basically telling me to buckle up because there\\u2019s more tension and destruction coming. We\\u2019ve already had a lot, but there\\u2019s more based on the planetary alignments. For whatever reason, it\\u2019s time for me to leave the house. I head out and am walking down the side of the road. I don\\u2019t know if I have my mask on or if I\\u2019m carrying it with me. The skies are dark and ominous. There are cars going by and I\\u2019m trying to avoid them. It\\u2019s strange, it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m trying to avoid people all together. The road is paved, but either side of the road are grassy fields without a lot of buildings or anything. In the distance I can see a stand of trees, way far down the way. All of a sudden there's a group of younger people also on the side of the road. I\\u2019m trying to keep distance from them for whatever reason - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s quarantine rules or what. I can hear what is going on. They\\u2019re all talking and being talked to by a scout leader or something. The scout leader is trying to prepare them for stuff. I\\u2019m trying to mind my own business and read the astrology and whatnot. They are teenagers, 16-18 years old. The scout leader is warning them: \\u201cHey, pay attention. There are people out there who will kidnap you! We\\u2019re kind of living in this no-man\\u2019s land type of place with no rules. There are definitely people out to get you.\\u201d It sounded a lot like conspiracy theory stuff, but he was basically trying to warn these kids about a cartel of people who were kidnapping kids and doing trafficking but also trying to give them coronavirus. I was nodding my head with him and saying, \\u201cYeah, watch out. This stuff is real. There are people out there who don\\u2019t have your best interest at heart and are running the world and have let this virus come out. You\\u2019ve gotta be careful because not everything is as it seems.\\u201d At this point cars are going by and I see old white people who look like they are on their way to church going by in their cars. Then, somehow the scene changes and I\\u2019m in a train station. It\\u2019s like all of a sudden I\\u2019m trying to get away from people. I see that some of these kids are on a train. It reminds me of the images I saw growing up from the Holocaust with people packed onto the trains. It\\u2019s kind of like what I\\u2019m living in the dream. There are \\u201cbad guys\\u201d who are putting us on the train and trying to scare us and poke at us. I\\u2019m watching all of this and realize it\\u2019s time for me to go. I gather up my mat that I was sitting on, my newspaper and my mask. I am watching this shady stuff go down. I start to walk away hoping no one notices me so I can walk back to my friend\\u2019s house. I do manage to sneak off and they don\\u2019t stop me.\"],[\"I am back with my Ex, and we were so happy in my dream (for so many times, I really don't want to wake up, for I do miss her so much, besides I'm a girl, too, but I don't consider myself as a typical lesbian)\"],[\"I am doing something fun with a group of people\\u2026.I have a cool note pad, with paper that seems like special stationery, with a coat of arms, ancient insignia, and a template for the week that has something cool happening on each day\\u2026.Other people are watching, though, and they have bad intentions\\u2026.They want to take all this and use it for their own purposes during the crisis\\u2026.\"],[\"I am doing things to help the Parks and Recreation characters\\u2026.Ron accidentally pokes a hole in a wall with the end of a metal pole he is using to roast meat\\u2026.\"],[\"I am going into a big, big room\\u2026.a massive cubic space, lots of people there, like a party?\\u2026.there is one word I need to remember for it all to open up, but I cannot remember it\\u2026.something about crystal?....At the end, I see Darth Vader, he just walked up on my right\\u2026.He is not scary, just curious\\u2026.\"],[\"I am having trouble sending a packet of information to the students of my class\\u2026.My message will not go through\\u2026.there are too many weird attachments, other objects and things that make it complex\\u2026.like a bad email\\u2026.I wonder, how can I do it differently?....\"],[\"I am helping a king and a queen with something\\u2026.How to get settled?....later, a group of four young people are driving in a small gray or blue sedan car\\u2026.A very modest little vehicle\\u2026.I am helping them, too\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping couples with something important\\u2026.later, I start to go into the meadow to the moon garden, but then I stop\\u2026.I realize I should go the regular way, through the trees on the trail, and not make a new trail through the grass\\u2026.Don\\u2019t take the shortcut, go the regular way\\u2026.another scene: I toss a little white packet into a waste basket\\u2026.another white packet is in there\\u2026.oh oh, wait, that is actually very useful, I should not throw it away\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping figure out an astronaut crew\\u2026.unsure how it will go\\u2026.it is secret\\u2026.Everyone goes to a star trainer\\u2026.including a woman\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping investigate something\\u2026.But it is very complex\\u2026.New evidence comes in, what do we do?\\u2026.Oh, it has a video with it\\u2026.This makes it easier\\u2026.Earlier, I see a bent log or piece of wood far down in the water\\u2026.Someone wants to get it now, but I say not now, we will get it later\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping people deal with the crisis, using an excel spreadsheet\\u2026.They do not like it, though\\u2026.I keep trying, with other ways, as they want\\u2026.But I know the spreadsheet would still be helpful\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping people with a big array of things in different kinds of glass jars, vases, and containers\\u2026.After they are empty, I help sort and clean them\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping some bad guys or opponents with something\\u2026.a video?....They wait a long time, then it will be shown?....Each of them is holding a sack in their hands?....\"],[\"I am helping with forest products\\u2026.incense, other small organic items\\u2026.we have lots of them, laid out on metal trays\\u2026.it is cool, fun\\u2026.Later, I see a building, like a low-rent motel, saying \\u201cKingsridge\\u201d, with a vertical sign\\u2026.I think of how it is a more grand name and sign than the place itself seems to merit\\u2026.Later, I see some dark coats, jackets, and other clothing out, laying across chairs, not hung up properly\\u2026.I think of how I should do that, to help the nice clothes not get wrinkled by just sitting out like this\\u2026.\"],[\"I am hiding out with my husband at the border of Oregon and California. We are on the Oregon side in some bushes. We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We\\u2019ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we\\u2019ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn\\u2019t have to smear the lotion in the dog\\u2019s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they\\u2019re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They\\u2019ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I\\u2019m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I\\u2019m thinking that maybe he\\u2019ll drive because he isn\\u2019t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river. He has found a stick and a net on a long pole, like a pool skimmer. It\\u2019s broken around the edges and the net is slightly torn. A couple comes by with their dog on a leash. They let the dog off leash and the dog jumps in the water where my son was pretending to fish with his net. My son just stands and watches at first. But then he wants to try to fish for the dog. I tell him not to. There\\u2019s a little back and forth between us. I then tell my son that we will have to go to another part of the river or I\\u2019ll take away the net. I\\u2019d rather the people just leave with their dog instead of continuing to throw the stick into the water for the dog to fetch. Eventually I get my son to draw back and watch until they decide to leave.\"],[\"I am hosting a party. I\\u2019m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There\\u2019s a fireplace. There\\u2019s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I\\u2019m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We\\u2019re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they\\u2019re here at the party for a reason, but there\\u2019s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don\\u2019t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what\\u2019s up. They\\u2019ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There\\u2019s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what\\u2019s being discussed, but it seems like there\\u2019s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don\\u2019t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what\\u2019s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we\\u2019ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. Let\\u2019s do that. We\\u2019ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.\\u201d It must be cold outside because there\\u2019s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What\\u2019s funny is they didn\\u2019t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it\\u2019s freezing. So there\\u2019s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don\\u2019t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they\\u2019ll put them near the fire. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I\\u2019ll just go put them in the fire.\\u201d But the shoes don\\u2019t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they\\u2019re wearing are mismatched. There\\u2019s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There\\u2019s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I\\u2019m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It\\u2019s like somehow we\\u2019ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it\\u2019s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they\\u2019re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it\\u2019s just me in the end. I\\u2019m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can\\u2019t remember what the changes are now. I\\u2019m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I\\u2019m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not a good idea. You\\u2019re a woman, this isn\\u2019t a good idea for you.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they\\u2019re leaving telling him: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She\\u2019s going to do what she\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn\\u2019t have to say and stop trying to control her. I\\u2019m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn\\u2019t being heard by my dad. I couldn\\u2019t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I\\u2019m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I\\u2019m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss\\u2019 artwork but the customer\\u2019s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I\\u2019m printing it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t your artwork.\\u201d She comes and looks at it and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely not.\\u201d There are huge instructions in the order and I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cNo. We don\\u2019t print other people\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m not going to do this.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d We look over and there are packages with more of this customer\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.\\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I\\u2019m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they\\u2019re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, \\u201cOh, who is that?!\\u201d My friend is there, too, and I think she\\u2019s in the room with somebody, but she\\u2019s not because she\\u2019s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn\\u2019t her. We\\u2019re all like, \\u201cWho was that?!\\u201d We walk down the hall and it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don\\u2019t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey can I get one of those? I want a turn!\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he\\u2019s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I look at him like, \\u201cCan I get a turn?\\u201d and he blushes and is like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.\"],[\"I am in a big boat in the middle of a very choppy, stormy sea. I\\u2019m with a group of people. A huge wave comes and crashes over the boat, throwing us all into the water. The water is black from the storm and the night I see this animal that looks like a dead whale being pushed around on the waves. I struggle up to the whale to see if it is alive and if it could be saved. I know it is dangerous, but I do it anyway. As I reach to hold the whale, it turns into a prehistoric or alien creature, close in size to a sea turtle, but alien in shape and texture. Now I\\u2019m trying to keep a hold of this creature and bring us both to the shore. I see other people I know in the water and we are all diving under the waves to swim in calmer depths. When I come up for breath, I notice people in rowboats. They are not good people. They are wanting to capture this creature and take it from me. I need to work harder to hold on and swim deep under the water to safety. They see me one time when I go get a breath of air, and I feel like I\\u2019m in grave danger. Somehow I get away. I reach an underwater city. I open a door into an empty room and then go through another door to a cobbled street. I am still underwater, but can breathe and move easily. I must keep going and hold this creature close to me because they could get me at any moment. Then in another part of the dream, I am with my friend, George and a friend of his who I don\\u2019t know. I have a phone and an iPad. We need to get to a concert and the address and transportation information about the buses are on the devices. I\\u2019m worried that it\\u2019s time to go and we might miss the first bus. George says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make it.\\u201d Then I say I have to put on my makeup. He says, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to wear makeup girl. You\\u2019re beautiful. You\\u2019re not a baby anymore.\\u201d\"],[\"I am in a building, a gym I think. There\\u2019s a table in front of me and a tv hanging on the wall to my left. The owners of the gym or building come up to the front desk where I\\u2019m sitting. I have a photo of myself completely naked. In the photo, my upper body is facing the camera. My breasts are prominently displayed. The photo itself is sepia-toned like it\\u2019s been dyed with onion skin. I don\\u2019t want to give it to the owners but they had asked me to come up with a campaign or a slogan or a logo or something for the building. I\\u2019m very hesitant because I know that the wife is going to be derogatory and I don\\u2019t want to hear what she has to say. When I hand it to them the husband just looks at it with the male gaze taking it in and making some comment about my body which I am irritated with. And then the wife cops an eyebrow and asks why I thought that was a good idea. The scene changes and the wife and I are folding clothes together like you fold clothes at a retail store. She\\u2019s showing me these tan pouches that are closed with a zipper and are about 4x6. She tells me that these pouches can help you swim if you put them on your head. And now we are out in a harbor or beach and there\\u2019s a swimming race going on. I\\u2019m watching mostly men with these pouches on their heads swim out to a buoy and back around. She tells me that I need to swim and I don\\u2019t want to because I know that I\\u2019m out of shape and I can\\u2019t swim and my shoulder hurts. But she says that if I put the pouch on my head, I\\u2019ll be fine. It seems silly to me, but I do it anyway, but I can\\u2019t see because the pouch is over my eyes. The water is foaming. I can\\u2019t see anything as I\\u2019m swimming out to the buoy mostly trying not to drown. Then I turn around and dive under the water and suddenly everything is better. I can breathe under the water. I don\\u2019t have a stupid pouch on my head. I can see. It is crystal clear. I can see the reef, I can see the fish, I can see the sea anemones. I can see everything under the water. I can even see the swimmers up above me - their bodies swimming over my head. I\\u2019m trying to get back to the start - the shore - the beginning - but it\\u2019s through a narrow passageway and I can feel how strong the current is. I\\u2019m still underwater and I pull myself through the passageway by grabbing on the reef that is below me, pulling myself forward. Then I am out of the water and the race is over. I\\u2019m in a home with all these cut strawberries and other fruits on platters with cheese. The wife is there and she\\u2019s prepared all these platters for us to eat. The strawberries are so red and so sweet. Her demeanor has somehow changed from one of being incredibly disdainful and derogatory towards me to caring and nurturing.\"],[\"I am in a dimly lit room\\u2026.Some people come and open the door, bringing more light into the room\\u2026.They want my help with something\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a group, finishing up the holidays, trying to focus on bigger things\\u2026.but a woman wants to do a bunch of special small things for kids, as additions to all the other activities\\u2026.little toys, musical instruments, cookies\\u2026.The woman is very enthusiastic about it\\u2026.I am not, but it is ok, I am fine going along with it\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a group, we are supposed to help fill or load some train box cars\\u2026.I do not know why\\u2026.we have to move and do this fast, it feels coercive, someone making us do this\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a parking lot. I think it's where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I\\u2019ve driven there for something, I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m reversed into a parking stall and I\\u2019m not sure what kind of car mine is. There\\u2019s another call a few stalls down, I think it\\u2019s a black Honda Civic. Then a few parking stalls down are a bunch of construction workers working on something. There are cut pieces of wood and sawdust everywhere. I\\u2019m not sure what they\\u2019re working on but they\\u2019re in my psychic space, making noise and part of the dream, but I\\u2019m not too focused on them, except trying to make sure I stay out of their way. I\\u2019m going through stuff in the trunk of my car. I\\u2019m rummaging through it and trying to reorganize everything. I have bags with clothes and shoes and all kinds of things in the car. So I\\u2019m trying to find something but also trying to reorganize everything. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding stuff and I realize it\\u2019s because I\\u2019m looking in the other car, my boss\\u2019 car, the black Honda Civic. I\\u2019m in the trunk of that one. There\\u2019s a pair of black high heels with bows on the front - they\\u2019re not mine, they\\u2019re hers. I\\u2019m moving them around and hen I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWait a second, no wonder I can\\u2019t find anything, I\\u2019m in the wrong car.\\u201d So I go back to my car and I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes or something. My car is broken down. I finish rummaging in the back then go up to this kiosk in the parking lot. It\\u2019s a place where you can write a claim so you can get your car fixed. There are a bunch of other people around - a family with some kids and an older lady with white hair. They\\u2019ve all already written claims and are waiting for the next step or they\\u2019re waiting in line to write their claims. It\\u2019s kind of crowded. There\\u2019s a younger woman behind the desk at the kiosk. She\\u2019s telling everybody what to do, where to go, and what to fill out. She gives me this ticket and I go to fill it out but the ticket is printed wrong. The places where you put your name and address are tilted on the ticket and not in a straight line. And the background of the ticket, instead of being blank has a watermark that is repeated along the whole ticket, so it\\u2019s hard to write anything down. I\\u2019m looking at the ticket and looking at her and am like, \\u201cIs this the thing I need to get my car fixed? Will this help?\\u201d This parking for this gigantic building, almost a skyscraper. To the left of the kiosk is this skyscraper and to my right is a hedge. It\\u2019s like this is a parking lot where you can park then go walk downtown. I\\u2019m noticing the trees. The trees are red, so it\\u2019s fall. It\\u2019s a somewhat disjointed dream because it\\u2019s an urban landscape and I don\\u2019t really know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m trying to get accomplished. I think I'm trying to get my car fixed. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m with Josh and two other people, I\\u2019m not sure who they are. We\\u2019re in this futuristic seeming town or city. The colors are white and blue, all different shades of lighter blue. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. Josh just decides he\\u2019s totally horny and grabs me by the hips and bends me over so he can fuck me from behind. But we\\u2019re on the street and on a set of stairs going up to a building. The buildings are low, not skyscrapers. There are no plants anywhere, but if there are, they are shades of white and blue. There\\u2019s just this entrance to a building where we stop at. I think that maybe we\\u2019re traveling with this other couple but I\\u2019m not sure where and I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re doing.\"],[\"I am in a room, trying to organize things for people who need help\\u2026.Below I see a black and white cow, energetic, active, and happy, trotting over, about to come up the stairs\\u2026.I quickly get out of the way to let it do so and come up, trying not to distract or deter it because of my presence\\u2026.Something about earlier dealings with dad\\u2026.At another point, I am in a car in a big town, lots of people on the streets, other cars stopped, waiting\\u2026.I suddenly see a bad guy I know, with wild gray hair, Ferdie?, running down the street in the gutter between the sidewalk and the street, with a big machine gun, he just robbed a place\\u2026.now he is trying to get away\\u2026.I see him get into a car with lots of women in fancy dresses, to hide or make them drive him, to escape?....\"],[\"I am in a school, parts of it look like my old high school and the people I\\u2019m with feel like my old classmates. I\\u2019m teaching and it feels like what I\\u2019m teaching is very basic - it\\u2019s stuff that most people already know, although my classmates don\\u2019t seem to know it. I leave the classroom that I\\u2019m in and head outside. There\\u2019s a bunch of kids - they\\u2019re younger than me and they\\u2019re not particularly friendly. It\\u2019s definitely a clique and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re showing off and I don\\u2019t really feel welcome, so I leave and head to this classroom where another young woman is teaching and I love what she\\u2019s teaching. It\\u2019s all new and I\\u2019ve never run into it before, but it makes perfect sense and it\\u2019s a type of sociology about the way humans interact and how we communicate and can have adult mature conversations. The kids in this clique are in there, kind of, but they\\u2019re acting like they\\u2019ve heard all of it even though it\\u2019s all new to me. I\\u2019m just noticing the difference between my classmates who I was teaching who are older and these younger kids who seem to already know a lot and are very aloof. I sit down and have a conversation with the teacher who is maybe a little bit younger than me but not by much. She tells me about this raincoat or jacket (I forget the name she called it), but she\\u2019s showing me this things she\\u2019s wearing and it looks like a snakeskin where she cut a slit through the side of the body and can fit her head into when she puts it on it actually expands out and her arms go - one side goes down into the tail and the other side goes down into the head and expands and lifts up and out. It covers her like a cape, but when she takes it off it goes back into its snakeskin size and she just curls it up and puts it in her bag. I\\u2019m totally fascinated and she very much loves it and likes talking about it. She says it\\u2019s a lot like the capes that the Scots used to wear. I don\\u2019t know what that means. I take her word for it. And then it\\u2019s time for us to leave this classroom. We\\u2019re going to a competition of sorts. She and these standoffish kids and me and some of my friends who are going to be performing, we get in the back of a truck/wagon and we\\u2019re on our way. The standoffish kids are down at the bottom and even though it\\u2019s a celebration, they are not drinking any alcohol. The friends around me, they have all of their instruments and supplies, and they keep talking about the alcohol they\\u2019re going to drink, and I don\\u2019t want to. I think, no, we don\\u2019t want to drink, it makes us poor players, it makes us so we can\\u2019t compete very well. We won\\u2019t win. One of them starts to pass around a bottle of champagne and I say I don\\u2019t want it. I stick a cork in it, but the cork won\\u2019t stay - the fizzies keep popping it off. Somebody else comes in and says, \\u201coh there\\u2019s a way to make a cork that will stay but you have to know the magic.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t seem to know it. I don\\u2019t like it anyway. I just keep thinking that if they start drinking, we won\\u2019t be able to compete and those other kids will win the competition. It seems so off to me that alcohol is still available anyway. We arrive at the carnival/festival/competition place we were heading to. There\\u2019s a big outdoor tent. It\\u2019s kind of dark and gloomy throughout this whole dream - not a lot of sunshine. The younger kids go off and set up their project or their music or whatever it is. Me and my companions also set up our space. What I notice is there\\u2019s not a lot of help getting it set up. I can tell I\\u2019m doing a lot of work. We have some sort of booth and people are coming by. We are explaining to the judges what our booth represents - what all the things we\\u2019ve set up are for. There\\u2019s this feeling that is not quite up to snuff or up to par - it\\u2019s not what\\u2019s needed right now. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re showing or doing is 2 or 3 steps behind whatever those kids are setting up or doing - just like in the school where they seemed 2 or 3 steps ahead in their courses already even though I was a teacher that was teaching to my peers. The fair thing is over now and it\\u2019s time to clean up and clear off the table. All of my friends leave and leave me to do the cleaning up for myself. I\\u2019m distraught because I\\u2019m supposed to go with those younger kids wherever they\\u2019re going. That teacher is with them and she\\u2019s beckoning me to come with, but I don\\u2019t go because if I don\\u2019t clean up, nobody else will and I\\u2019m the only one who knows where everything goes anyway.\"],[\"I am in a swimming pool, with lots of people\\u2026.there will be a race?....I realize that things will take a while to organize, and meanwhile I have time to go inside and smoke some plums\\u2026.I go in, and realize I am naked\\u2026.hmm, that is strange, are other people naked too?....I wonder if my swimsuit is nearby\\u2026.it does not seem like a big deal, I will get back in the water and it will be fine\\u2026.Later, I see some homeless guys on a street corner, playing rhythms with Quaker Oats big cylinder containers as drums\\u2026.I have an oats container of my own, with a handful of oats inside shaking around, and I go over and play with them, dancing and skipping around happily to the beat\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a truck, the driver parks it in a weird place next to a creek\\u2026.The driver gets out and leaves, while I am still in the truck\\u2026.Then the truck slips, and somehow ends up on a little island in the creek\\u2026.I wonder, how did that happen?....Other park rangers on the other side of the creek, look at me with mild concern, but do nothing\\u2026.OK, what do I do?....I wonder, should I jump over the water?....I could do so, it is not that far a jump\\u2026.Later, I go back to the truck, and a small old blue car is parked by the sidewalk\\u2026.It is revving its engine hard and loud, which makes me want to keep my distance\\u2026.I see a guy behind the wheel, his girlfriend next to him, and maybe a kid?....Hispanics?....I am scared of them, and try not to get their attention\\u2026.I walk by the car and casually pick up a paper clip from the ground, a couple of bent ones are scattered around\\u2026.They drive away, and I am relieved, phew\\u2026.Earlier, Hillary Clinton is part of some small group of people\\u2026.The others like her, she is a good worker, gets stuff done\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in charge of creating more clues for the big scavenger hunt\\u2026.We are supposed to make the clues easier, more interconnected, keep the group together\\u2026.Some people worry that it is not happening\\u2026.I do it, but then I forget where the clues are\\u2026.Now I get worried, do I have to manage this whole thing?....No, at some point I realize this is not real, I am relieved\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in charge of some animals, helping them get through this crisis\\u2026.There are several different kinds of cats\\u2026.I am trying to make sure they all get along in a friendly way\\u2026.Earlier, something about a big oval rock or boulder\\u2026.the image of it, surrounded by lots of smaller rocks, like they are all floating in space\\u2026.The big rock is my connection, my way to get home amid all the other rock formations\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in Elizabeth\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the house I\\u2019ve always known since I was young. We\\u2019ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I\\u2019ve brought isn\\u2019t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, \\u201cSee how tall the ceiling is?! It\\u2019s always been this tall.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYes, so tall!\\u201d Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can\\u2019t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn\\u2019t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she\\u2019ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, \\u201cOh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I\\u2019ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.\\u201d She\\u2019s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I\\u2019m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day. When I go to her office this time, it\\u2019s different. There are walls around the office. She\\u2019s there, but the bears are not.\"],[\"I am in the Kensington house, trying to get ready for a run\\u2026.but I do not have the right gear?....then to my surprise I see a big black bear outside\\u2026.I am amazed, but scared\\u2026.What does it want?....I need to make sure it stays outside, does not come in the house\\u2026.It crawls over the deck, and seems to go up the north side of the house\\u2026.Then I see in the back deck Strauss our cat, sitting near a couple of bear cubs\\u2026.I can tell Strauss is uncomfortable, so I quickly let him in\\u2026.Later, I am telling about all this to a woman I like a lot\\u2026.Earlier, I find myself standing next to a big elk, and its light-colored rear haunches\\u2026.I pat it gently on the back, right at the base of its spine, and rest my hand there\\u2026.I think that feels good for the elk\\u2026.\"],[\"I am involved in a process with two aspects\\u2026.One is not popular with the public\\u2026.something to do with the Nazis?....How to integrate the two is the question, the challenge\\u2026.\"],[\"I am involved in lots of friendly activities with other people\\u2026.but I suddenly wonder with some anxiety, is this too much social interaction, too close together, not being careful enough, will this cause problems?....At some point I open the door to my study, and Phantom our cat rushes out, causing me concern, but then to my surprise he immediately turns around and comes back inside again\\u2026.\"],[\"I am lost in a hospital trying to find my way back to my own unit but keep finding my self in a construction area. I'm frantic but not afraid.\"],[\"I am on a break from class. This is midway into the dream and I cannot recall the parts just before. I\\u2019m walking through a parking lot by an ocean. I\\u2019m picking up speed and running then flying over the ocean. I\\u2019m catching the wind and feeling free, but also realize the break is almost over and I need to get back to class quickly. I am skimming over the ocean, feeling the splash of the salt water. At first I\\u2019m going out to sea, then I catch the wind under my arms. A big wave is coming and I catch it. I\\u2019m surfing flying the wave like a pelican. I can feel the momentum and it\\u2019s exhilarating. It takes me right next to a rock face and between a narrow crevice of rocks. I can see the water rise as the wave and I approach. It\\u2019s as if time slows so I can precisely fly through this narrow area without catching the sides of the rocks. I make it to shore and return to the classroom. The desks have been rearranged. They are set up closer together. I recall having a conversation with a woman before break about where to sit. She\\u2019s a young Asian woman and reminds me of a Biology Major and Pre-Med student at Stanford University. We will be sitting next to each other at the back of the classroom. I arrive before she does and see her notebooks stacked on a chair. I move them over one so that my chair is closest to the professor\\u2019s desk. Other people are coming in now and finding their desks. The young Asian woman comes to sit next to me in the back. I get up and push the desks around so they aren\\u2019t so cramped together. She has just voted for the president. She is talking with me about how Edward has been communicating with her about upcoming projects and he\\u2019s looking to hire someone new at the end of October. I\\u2019m concerned that my work will be done and a new intern will come in. I\\u2019m uneasy about this. Then more students come in. The woman is yelling at the students and taunting them about not voting. She is very righteous in proclaiming that she already voted and used her break time wisely. She is telling them that they must vote now. The professor is now sitting at his desk. It\\u2019s Edward. The desk is in the far left back corner of the room facing the students. We are all in our chairs that have the desks attached to them facing the front of the room. There are blank chalkboards across the front. Edward raises his voice and sternly says, \\u201cWe are not to take sides! In no way are we to take sides!\\u201d This quiets the woman and all the other students now. He\\u2019s clearly irritated and reviewing his lesson plan. He\\u2019s looking over a list of historic figures and saying the names aloud so we remember the ones he has talked about already. I\\u2019m hearing the names of these men, but it\\u2019s as though I\\u2019m hearing them for the first time. These are names of politicians that I feel like I should know but I do not. I\\u2019m trying to write them all down as quickly as I can so I can look them up later and be better informed.\"],[\"I am on a mission to gather all systems and screens that filter reality for people\\u2026.I set them aside, so I only get direct reality\\u2026.Others do not know or understand this, but I do not care\\u2026.A situation comes up, there is no filter, and I deal with it fine, all is good\\u2026.At another point, I see coming up on the beach a big white shark\\u2026.I realize it knows it can still attack people this way\\u2026.It comes up on the sand, and chases people\\u2026.I go inside, get people in, then close the door\\u2026.The shark pushes hard against the door, forcing it open a few inches\\u2026.Scared, I struggle to keep it from breaking inside all the way\\u2026.\"],[\"I am on a train - like a child\\u2019s park train - with a bunch of other people. We are heading back from grocery shopping. Each person is dropped off at their house and the train continues down the tracks. I arrive at my house - a shared co-op style home. I\\u2019m putting away the groceries. There are other people in the kitchen with me. Then I\\u2019m in a more public space. I have to go the bathroom and am uncomfortable because I no longer like to use public restrooms because of the fear of other people\\u2019s lack of health or cleanliness. I go into the bathroom and see that the toilet lid and seat are covered in purple bubble wrap. I need to pull it off and put on new purple bubble wrap. I do this but am frustrated because the person before me didn\\u2019t do her job in cleaning up after herself. I lift the lid up and see that someone has defecated but not bothered to flush. Now I have a handful of purple bubble wrap, but still need to flush the toilet, then use the toilet, and somehow not contaminate myself. It\\u2019s frustrating and I don\\u2019t think I ever do use the bathroom. I\\u2019m looking for a trashcan to throw all this stuff out, then wash my hands and leave. Then I go out to the lawn. There\\u2019s a group of people singing songs. I join them. One of the songs is so wonderful that it makes me leap up and dance. I\\u2019m the only one dancing in the green grass and under the bright blue sunny sky. I\\u2019m feeling so happy alive, to be outside, to be dancing, and to be feeling free. Even though others are still not dancing, I do not hold myself back from this joy. Then later on, I\\u2019m inside a big building. There are a lot of people beginning to gather for a dance. The large group is subdivided into several smaller groups. There are rules for this dance. You have to wait to be chosen. My smaller group has two different leaders - a black man and a white woman. They are one-by-one choosing people to enter the dance. The other smaller groups are doing the same. So with each person, the dance floor gets more crowded. Finally, it\\u2019s just me and another standing and waiting in this crowd of dancers. I\\u2019m really wanting this guy to come choose me because I love the way he dances and I\\u2019m so excited for the possibility of dancing with him and feeling his rhythm. Then someone turns around and looks at me and says, \\u201cWell, you can start dancing now. You don\\u2019t have to wait for anybody.\\u201d I wonder if it\\u2019s okay for me to be dancing by myself. I look around and see everyone dancing by themselves. I slowly join in, trying to catch the momentum that has been in full swing.

I keep going into a building but I\\u2019m not supposed to be inside because it\\u2019s reserved for other people. A convention or something is happening.

They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome dance with us.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and am like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember any of the dances.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don\\u2019t remember the dances. They also don\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s like we haven\\u2019t practiced in a long time and we haven\\u2019t gotten together in a long time. But we\\u2019re all getting together for this. I feel so awkward. It\\u2019s really just affording me a reason for me to be in this building that I need or just want to be in. I\\u2019m not sure why. The halau is getting ready. I think I\\u2019m still in costume. I hide from them. I climb up a balcony or something. I\\u2019m not even taking stairs. I\\u2019m climbing things and definitely trespassing. I get to a classroom and it\\u2019s a kindergarten classroom. All the kindergarten decor is in there. I\\u2019m hiding in there. I think the teacher is trying to get the classroom ready because there aren\\u2019t a lot of kids. But there are some kids, so I think maybe it\\u2019s a school. I need to use the bathroom and it\\u2019s a little kid\\u2019s bathroom so the toilet is just two feet off the ground. I come out and have these feelings that I shouldn\\u2019t be here but don\\u2019t know why I need to be there. I head out of the classroom and climb back down and head back to the hula sisters. We do perform but I don\\u2019t know if I actually perform with them or watch. I wake up with this sense of not knowing what\\u2019s going on, I shouldn\\u2019t be here, I don\\u2019t have the skills, I don\\u2019t remember the dances, and none of this is my scene.\"],[\"I am performing on a stage. There are two other people with me and a big audience watching us along with a judge. The three of us are doing an interpretation of a dance that has been taught to us. There\\u2019s something to do with jumping over a plastic spice lid and when you jump you need to land with the right amount of strength so just the right amount of ginger pops up out of the lid to dust the floor just enough. I am dancing with a lot of energy and flare. It feels so good. At the end, the judge leaps onto the stage and lifts my hand up and bows with me saying that i have done it just perfectly. The crowd is cheering. There are also people who have noted my perfection of sorts and I don\\u2019t feel particularly safe by their attention. There is another scene where I am in a department store. On one level are clothes designed to fit me and there is a prenatal section. On the floor above are clothes designed for heavier set women and they also have a prenatal section. I\\u2019m on the upper floor, then descend to the floor with clothes that fit me. I go to the prenatal section because I remember seeing pants that I really like. I see Liz and some other women in that female entrepreneur coaching world. They are sitting on a couch watching a show or learning something. Liz sees me and stands but doesn\\u2019t acknowledge me in a friendly way. She just stands so that I know that she knows I\\u2019m there. There\\u2019s a section with folded pants - the style I like. I know what used to fit me when I was pregnant and I recall how they were stretchy. Other people are coming to get these pants, too - I guess they just learned about them on the show. Liz picks up a pair, too. They are all hand painted and very colorful.

They\\u2019re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don\\u2019t work. The reason I\\u2019m hiring this detective is because I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re watching my son very well and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s entirely safe. They\\u2019re watching him for me because I\\u2019m working and I don\\u2019t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They\\u2019re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It\\u2019s odd that they\\u2019re together because they don\\u2019t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they\\u2019re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who\\u2019s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they\\u2019re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I\\u2019m observing this whole thing. I\\u2019m on the pool deck somewhere but they don\\u2019t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They\\u2019re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you\\u2019re both talking shit about me and the fact that I\\u2019m not around to watch my son and it\\u2019s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I\\u2019m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can\\u2019t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law\\u2019s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn\\u2019t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.\\u201d My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There\\u2019s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I\\u2019m having them watch my son in the first place. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson\\u2019s mom to him. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I\\u2019m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, \\u201cPick a spot.\\u201d All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that\\u2019s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don\\u2019t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it\\u2019s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they\\u2019re taking the exam. I don\\u2019t have my books. In fact I didn\\u2019t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I\\u2019m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don\\u2019t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I\\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don\\u2019t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn\\u2019t miss too much and I could just get someone else\\u2019s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.\"],[\"I am teaching a yoga class. I\\u2019m subbing for my friend. It\\u2019s like I just pop up out of bed and there I am in the yoga studio. So I\\u2019m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it\\u2019s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don\\u2019t know who they are or where we are or what I\\u2019m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it\\u2019s just so odd. So I\\u2019m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren\\u2019t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I\\u2019m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can\\u2019t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it\\u2019s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn\\u2019t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It\\u2019s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I\\u2019m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can\\u2019t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I\\u2019ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.\"],[\"I am touring a large apartment building. Units are being made available as people move. Some are moving out completely, others are moving for a better view. When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I\\u2019m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we\\u2019ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That\\u2019s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I\\u2019d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There\\u2019s a sign about reservations required. It\\u2019s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It\\u2019s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I\\u2019m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don\\u2019t want to pay because there\\u2019s only fifteen minutes left. I\\u2019m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn\\u2019t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we\\u2019re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It\\u2019s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I\\u2019m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there\\u2019s no place for me to sit. I\\u2019m watching my son to see if he\\u2019s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.\"],[\"I am trying to explain to a group of people how a play has multiple levels\\u2026.One or two levels lower than the surface\\u2026.We set up an example with a guy student, to make it easy to understand\\u2026.One of the lower levels is the unconscious, I try to explain that\\u2026.\"],[\"I am walking down the hall of a big house or mansion\\u2026.I have a box with a live mouse in it\\u2026.I am going to give it to one of our cats, to eat\\u2026.I come to a sitting room where a couple of people are already playing with the cat\\u2026.it\\u2019s Levi?....So I wait, not wanting to disrupt their play\\u2026.I feel some misgivings about letting the cat have the mouse, but not too much\\u2026.Earlier, a woman sits on my lap, we make out\\u2026.\"],[\"I am walking on a sidewalk with my husband and see a pile of packages ready to be mailed.

We see that one package is not fully wrapped. It\\u2019s a cake and waffles. We nibble the waffles and love them! We eat around the perimeter and hope it doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019ve been snacking on their gift. Then I\\u2019m with my husband and his family - dad, step-mom and step-sisters. We\\u2019re standing in a circle and they are passing around the beautiful cake that Sherry sent. They cut different sized slices and Krista takes an extra large slice - it\\u2019s so big there isn\\u2019t enough for everyone. Either I or my son grab the cake from her and start to eat. She\\u2019s upset, but the rest of the group says \\u201cno, they need cake, too.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful cake with orange frosting, different layers and textures. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in the same room, but it\\u2019s later in the day. I\\u2019m alone with my son. My husband\\u2019s dad walks in but he looks like a zombie, as if he\\u2019s been in a car accident. He\\u2019s completely bald and white pale and his face is streaming with blood.

He pulls me over and begins kissing me. It\\u2019s intoxicating. We make love in a clearing. Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There\\u2019s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I\\u2019m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there\\u2019s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I\\u2019ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I\\u2019ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend. My friend is at a bar and I tell them what\\u2019s going on. I laugh. Then I\\u2019m suddenly at the bar, outside. I can see stuffed animal penguins in the grass - one on its side and one on its feet, walking towards the water. There\\u2019s another moment with Tad - beautiful and romantic coming together that I wish I could remember better.\"],[\"I am watching a mom I know from town. Her daughter is about the same age as my son. In waking life, she has always been discontent with being a mother. I\\u2019ve tried to not judge her way of complaining about her daughter being a distraction to her art, because it so far of how I perceive motherhood. She has made a deal for her birthday that the time with her daughter will be front loaded to this time of life, so she can get it over with. Somehow, her daughter will grow older faster, while the mom ages at the same rate. So time is expanded in some way. It\\u2019s unusual to watch. Now I\\u2019m in an airplane and my brother in law is flying it. I\\u2019m grateful for his skill - he flies helicopters in waking life. He\\u2019s taking off and we\\u2019re gaining momentum, though not climbing high into the air as quickly as I expected. He\\u2019s staying low to the ground and identifying men who he knows as officers in the military. He flies directly over their head - the sergeant, the colonel and the captain. We are escaping. We have to get out because a war is coming.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of people, we go through a line past a display of little plastic water bottles, uniforms with names, and other things for people to get back to work\\u2026.I will not touch any of it, I feel worried it is not safe yet to do so, given the crisis\\u2026.Other people argue over this, but I know what I know\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with a bunch of young women, each one with a distinctive set of red and yellow cherries\\u2026.We all get along, there is a happy vibe\\u2026.Then, someone is playing Monopoly, and gets a card that takes them to both Park Place and Boardwalk, the most expensive properties on the board\\u2026.That is a good card to get at the beginning, because you can buy them first, but a bad card at the end, because then you have to pay the owner\\u2026.I think of how this card being in the deck forces things to happen in the game\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with a fellow priestess/witch, but I don\\u2019t recognize her from this lifetime. I am apprenticing under her. I\\u2019ve already done my apprenticeship actually and now I\\u2019m coming to learn what she does at her station. She\\u2019s in this small tourist town with all four seasons, and it\\u2019s Fall now. I\\u2019m not exactly what she\\u2019s there for, but she\\u2019s showing me how she does the Work. There are some things I need to know about the job specifically. I\\u2019m not sure if she\\u2019s there for protection or what. We\\u2019re in a house, like an old cabin with walls made of wood. I\\u2019m watching what she\\u2019s doing. She has this rolling cart that\\u2019s got two tiers and a bunch of stuff on it. She\\u2019s showing me how to charge up some things. I\\u2019m looking out the window and there\\u2019s water everywhere, so I think we\\u2019re on a lake or something. The town is behind us. I\\u2019m watching her hands move. I\\u2019m watching each of the steps she\\u2019s taking. I go to put my hands near the cart with artifacts. Everything feels really strong. I can feel the energy coming off. She keeps asking things like, \\u201cCan you feel that? We\\u2019re adding extra protection.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOf course I can feel that. Everything is really strong. This is what I\\u2019m trained for.\\u201d At one point she interrupts herself and apologizes. She says, \\u201cThese are my neuroses and I worry about these things. This is what I worry about, but I think you\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, I will be fine. I\\u2019ve had the training. I\\u2019m strong. I can feel the energy coming off. I can direct and mold and shape it as you\\u2019re doing. This is something I know how to do.\\u201d Then I maybe leave her to go run an errand or something. The scene changes and I\\u2019m outside the house. I\\u2019m walking through the town on the streets. I know a car accident is going to happen and then I witness it but keep going because I know the people can handle whatever is happening because it\\u2019s not a bad one, it\\u2019s just a fender bender t-bone, but everyone was going less than 25mph. Everyone is okay, they just have to get everyone\\u2019s insurance information. I continue to this open air marketplace. There are all kinds of items that you would find at a fair trade shop. I think I\\u2019m getting an ingredient we need for the cart and the spells we\\u2019re casting. I\\u2019m vibrating and radiating so much power, and I\\u2019m watching who\\u2019s starting to follow me. While I think everyone in this marketplace is human, some of the people are wearing helmets with horns, and someone looks like a totem - the totem is gold and I can\\u2019t tell whether it\\u2019s a hat they\\u2019re wearing or if they just are the totem with the different animals stacked on top of each other. So I\\u2019m just noticing who\\u2019s following me, who\\u2019s attracted to my energy and who\\u2019s not. Some of the people following me do have what feels like somewhat ill-intent but I know I\\u2019m untouchable so I\\u2019m not so worried about it. Some of the people following me don\\u2019t even know why they\\u2019re attracted to my energy, they just are, and they\\u2019re harmless. I\\u2019m going on my way even though I see all the people who are attracted to me or who are tracking me. Some of them are magic-makers themselves and they can do magic but they\\u2019re just watching. I find the item I\\u2019m supposed to find. I\\u2019m still watching who\\u2019s coming in and out of this market, noting who the non-magical beings are. I walk by this booth where they\\u2019re closing up shop because it\\u2019s twilight and the open air market is closed. One of the people closing up shop is Janaya Future Kahn and they are someone I know from instagram who identifies as \\u201cthey.\\u2019 They are beautiful and on instagram they do social justice work. The way they talk is so amazing, always coming from love. Even in my dream as I\\u2019m walking past them in their booth and they\\u2019re folding things up for the evening, they\\u2019re talking about love and getting things to people in need. I slow down long enough to watch them fold up one of their items and to listen to them talk. I\\u2019m so smitten because this person is such a caring, warm, loving person but also very fiery and passionate about what they\\u2019re doing. I know I\\u2019m to return back to my post, which is this house on the edge of the lake. As I\\u2019m walking back I see piers with sailboats and this house juts out over the water. It\\u2019s important that we\\u2019re over the water and that the water is under us in parts of our work. I\\u2019m watching the sun go down and it\\u2019s almost dark but the sky is all these beautiful colors. I know that I have all the skills I need for the task at hand. In fact, I\\u2019m overflowing with the amount of energy. I do think it\\u2019s interesting that when I walked by Janaya Future Kahn, they didn\\u2019t look up and see me; they were so focused on what they were doing that out of all the people in the marketplace who could feel me, they didn\\u2019t look up and see me at all. I thought it was so interesting that they were so engrossed in what they were doing and the conversation they were having with other people that they never even looked up.\"],[\"I am with a friend but I\\u2019m not actually sure who it is - there\\u2019s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we\\u2019ve known each other for a while. We\\u2019re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don\\u2019t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We\\u2019re walking through a town. We\\u2019re on the streets of the downtown area. It\\u2019s dark - like night time or really early morning. We\\u2019re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that\\u2019s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she\\u2019s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it\\u2019s a room off to the side. I\\u2019m so happy to see her. She\\u2019s such a beautiful soul. And she\\u2019s so happy to see me. She\\u2019s showing me some of the pieces she\\u2019s working on. It\\u2019s an interesting interaction because there\\u2019s this air of how much we love each other and she\\u2019s so excited about all her work and I\\u2019m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They\\u2019re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there\\u2019s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it\\u2019s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she\\u2019s found a different coffee shop. So we\\u2019re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It\\u2019s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I\\u2019m happy to see her, but also not. There\\u2019s a little bit of, \\u201cOh no, I don\\u2019t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me\\u201d (which is what happened in real life). So I\\u2019m kind of glad to see her, but there\\u2019s also part of her that\\u2019s also sort of ignoring me. She\\u2019s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I\\u2019m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I\\u2019m with - the one who I still don\\u2019t know who it is - says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.\\u201d So, we\\u2019re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There\\u2019s a bunch of people at it. They\\u2019ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\\u2019m on vacation. I\\u2019m not doing any business. There\\u2019s no meetings.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWell you know this is a BNI meeting.\\u201d The way these things work is if you\\u2019re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn\\u2019t know that was happening, but it feels like that\\u2019s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that\\u2019s gotten us in the mess we\\u2019re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh D\\u2019s here! Great!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my fucking god, get me out of here now.\\u201d He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn\\u2019t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, \\u201cEh.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw.\\u201d He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cFuck, you can\\u2019t even be neutral. You can\\u2019t even control your body. You\\u2019re in my damn space and I don\\u2019t even want to be here!\\u201d I still haven\\u2019t had any food or coffee, so probably I\\u2019m \\u201changry\\u201d - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don\\u2019t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I\\u2019m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it\\u2019s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it\\u2019s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I\\u2019m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There\\u2019s a pier off to my right. There\\u2019s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He\\u2019s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He\\u2019s also writing stuff out in the sand that they\\u2019re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren\\u2019t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I\\u2019m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There\\u2019s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I\\u2019m noticing them as I\\u2019m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I\\u2019m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.\"],[\"I am with a group of people\\u2026.We are each given a surprisingly simple object, and with that we are supposed to do complicated things\\u2026.This is not normal, we are all used to more elaborate objects to do this, so everyone is confused\\u2026.I am somewhat in charge of the process\\u2026.It is uncoordinated, but eventually we do what needs doing\\u2026.Lots of white cubes, spears, globes\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with a group of sisters and we\\u2019re all standing on yoga mats but we\\u2019re not doing yoga. I have taken off my adornments and placed them at the top of the mat and they\\u2019re almost in Ursula's in space, so she gives me this look and so I in a really apologetic way move them over to the side and hide away in a bit of shame for that. Again I\\u2019m not able to stand in my true power and be myself in her presence. There's a direction from somewhere, someone telling us to remove our clothes. We are all wearing these beautiful silk flowing gowns. Nobody moves at first. It\\u2019s an odd direction and we don\\u2019t know where it\\u2019s coming from. Then Ursula who is across from me on a mat steps forward in this really seductive way starts to slip off her dress. Two women on either side who are studying with her are her attendants and they help her remove her gown and all of her underthings. Then everyone else proceeds to do so. I feel like, oh gosh I have to also and so I remove my outer gown, but I keep on my underwear because I haven\\u2019t waxed and I\\u2019m feeling pretty shameful about that. So I\\u2019m left wearing a black thong. Then I\\u2019m in a room and one of my husband\\u2019s friends is lying on a couch. He\\u2019s 7 feet tall - a really big guy - and he\\u2019s kind of joking around. He says something that agitates me. I climb up onto him and start to pound on him in a playful way. And I say, \\u201cYou know I never really do this with anybody else, but you\\u2019re so big and it just seems okay to do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s laughing and he thinks it\\u2019s a funny thing, too. Then I\\u2019m in a building and I\\u2019m talking to this very wealthy man - a billionaire, creative person who I don\\u2019t know in waking life. My husband\\u2019s friend in the previous scene is also a very wealthy man. He\\u2019s talking about his vision for what he wants to create and bring me along with it. We are in a glass skyscraper type building and we see King Kong. King Kong is smashing buildings and it seems like he\\u2019s looking for this guy I\\u2019m with. He sees us through the window and comes toward us. We\\u2019re frantically trying to run away - run up the stairs or run down the stairs and get out of the building. And the building is crashing around us. I run downstairs into a hallway and I see an arrow pointing to a sign with a name - Beth. Beth is a friend of mine in town - she\\u2019s a counselor. So I see an arrow to her house and I run to find her. She\\u2019s there and she walks with me to the top of the stairs. She stays with my son in a stroller at the top of the stairs. I run down the stairs. I have to go to the bathroom. I end up in this Japanese style bathroom with all these automatic toilets that I have lights and sing songs. You\\u2019re supposed to go to the bathroom in a particular way and push the right buttons so it cleans you in a particular way. So I do, but just as I\\u2019m finishing up, a whole group of photographers are standing right outside the door. They walk in and I\\u2019m not fully dressed again. I\\u2019m feeling ashamed of being caught with my pants down.\"],[\"I am with a group, a woman is in charge, we are doing or investigating something\\u2026.Just before others arrive, she brings in lots of weapons, shiny silver guns, etc\\u2026.It is not related, but the people will notice and ask why\\u2026.This is to deceive, distract them from our real mission\\u2026.I wonder if she needed to do this\\u2026.It is a big burden on her\\u2026.I am both impressed and worried for her\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with a woman, looking at a group bathroom where she lives, like at a dorm\\u2026.I ask which drawer is hers, or maybe she points it out to me\\u2026.It is the one at the top in the center, which seems like the least private; every other person using the sink will be right next to it\\u2026.But I say having that drawer makes it like your own bathroom, the best drawer of all\\u2026.That does make her a little happier\\u2026.I say I always try to figure out the best way to look at things, even if they are bad; in what way does this have advantages that others do not?....Later, my wife and I are trying to kiss, but we are worried she has blisters on her lips, a spreading of her shingles?....\"],[\"i am with blacks\"],[\"I am with Josh, my partner. I\\u2019m standing in the kitchen next to the sink. There\\u2019s a concrete floor. I\\u2019ve made a salad for both of us. Things are a little strained between us. I ask him if he wants to dress the salad. He goes to get the olive oil and he spills it everywhere on the floor. I\\u2019m extremely annoyed and upset about this. My reaction does not make sense for the mistake he made. He can see I\\u2019m made. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cClean it up.\\u201d He goes outside to get a hose. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is he doing? Get a rag to clean this up.\\u201d Somehow the oil is spreading. I watch him go outside. I can see a fig tree through the window. The window is the kind we have in Hawaii with the old panes of glass. There are all these huge gorgeous yummy figs on the tree and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I want to go pick those figs.\\u201d He\\u2019s out there getting the hose but he\\u2019s fucking around. Meanwhile the oil keeps spreading more and more. I don\\u2019t want to go out because I\\u2019d step in the oil and spread it some more. I can see there are chickens out there and the chickens keep trying to eat the figs. I yell at him through the window: \\u201cPick the figs!\\u201d He goes to pick them but he doesn\\u2019t have a basket to put them in. The chickens keep going after him. He\\u2019s still messing with the hose. Then he turns into my dad. He\\u2019s a bumbling idiot out there and I\\u2019m super frustrated with the whole thing. I leave the kitchen and all of a sudden I\\u2019m in a grocery store co-op. There are a ton of plants. Josh, who has turned into my dad, has the hose now and is trying to come into the house with it to clean up the oil and water the plants. I\\u2019m watching him walk through the kitchen into this back room that\\u2019s a co-op. In this backroom are tons of starts. He goes to water them, but he has the hose on super high pressure and he\\u2019s obliterating all the seedlings. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing? Where\\u2019s your common sense?\\u201d I\\u2019m so irate. At this point I just ignore him and the whole thing. I go into my room, but I don\\u2019t want it to be my room because it\\u2019s a smaller room. My sister is there but it\\u2019s not actually my sister, it\\u2019s another little girl who is my sister in this dream. She\\u2019s talking non-stop and I just want some space. I\\u2019m especially annoyed because she has the bigger bedroom and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do I have this little one?\\u201d She has this little piece of paper with a calendar on it. The calendar has been pulled out of a magazine and the magazine is the flyer or coupon book for the co-op. I don\\u2019t even know if the dates are right on the calendar, I think it\\u2019s last year. She\\u2019s pinned the calendar on the wall for me and I think that\\u2019s useful. But then I look at the dates and see that it\\u2019s not useful. She\\u2019s pinned it over the one window in my bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy have you pinned it over the window?\\u201d I go to pull it off and it has just regular blinds over the window. She goes, \\u201cBecause it stares into my room.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d Sure enough, I go and look and all I can see is her bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh yeah, let\\u2019s put curtains over that.\\u201d She goes to put a curtain over it and the curtain is the same color as the walls. The walls are a very light bright bluish green. I\\u2019m hating all of it. I don\\u2019t like this wall color, I don\\u2019t like this curtain and the curtain doesn\\u2019t , I don\\u2019t like the size of this room and I don\\u2019t like that she\\u2019s in here. This is not what I would choose for my space at all. Why the hell am I here? My mom comes in and is trying to smooth things over. I go outside. She follows me outside. We go outside because there is a gorgeous sunset happening and I want to catch the sunset. But I didn\\u2019t bring my phone or camera. I tell my little sister to grab my phone. I\\u2019m in my twenties or thirties and she\\u2019s six or seven. She takes her fucking time but by the time she comes back the sunset is gone. It was a beautiful glorious sunset. I try to pick a few of the figs for myself. Now I look up and in the night sky and I can see the Earth and Jupiter and Saturn making this cluster in the sky. I start taking pictures. I can see the continents, clouds and oceans of the Earth from where I\\u2019m standing, which I thought was earth, but apparently it\\u2019s not. Then to see Saturn and Jupiter, I think, \\u201cWell of course I can see them close together, it was the Great Conjunction.\\u201d All of a sudden Earth becomes a meteor and Jupiter and Saturn go with it. They start to burn up like when a meteor goes through Earth\\u2019s atmosphere. I\\u2019m panicking. I\\u2019m in the yard with the kids. I\\u2019m looking down and can see buildings like in a city. These two kids are Indian from India. They start to laugh as the Earth travels through the atmosphere and starts burning up. I\\u2019m horrified but they\\u2019re laughing like it\\u2019s the greatest prank in the world. Then I realize that it\\u2019s a ball and they somehow managed with magic to make it look like Earth and Jupiter and Saturn. It is going to burn up as it comes through the atmosphere and it will land and make an explosion, but it\\u2019s a ball because it stays the same size. They\\u2019re laughing hysterically because they\\u2019ve just pulled off this prank. I\\u2019m horrified because this entire dream I\\u2019ve just had this sense of where am I, why am I here, what am I doing...I\\u2019m trying to find bits of beauty, but I miss the sunset. I do see Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, but they seem to be fake. I go back into the co-op and the manager of the co-op is there now. The co-op is filled out now. I see grocery store shelves stocked with fruits and vegetables, and aisles with alternative flowers. The co-op manager is trying to hire people. He gets on the PA to talk about the benefits of working at the co-op. He says something like, \\u201cYou have at least one weekend day off.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo way! I would never work there.\\u201d I\\u2019m kind of laughing because he\\u2019s awkward on the PA system. But it does sound terrible the way he described it. The dream ends with me looking at him with a puzzled look on my face. My mom, dad and sister have all disappeared from the dream. There\\u2019s one other co-op employee hanging around and rolling his eyes as he hears the manager talk.\"],[\"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I\\u2019m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She\\u2019s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She\\u2019s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I\\u2019m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we\\u2019re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it\\u2019s men. We\\u2019re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila\\u2019s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We\\u2019re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it\\u2019s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I\\u2019m watching and I see Aila\\u2019s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it\\u2019s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I\\u2019m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it\\u2019s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it\\u2019s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It\\u2019s not quite a break wall because it doesn\\u2019t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I\\u2019m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He\\u2019s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They\\u2019re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It\\u2019s okay that they\\u2019re playing. I don\\u2019t have any concerns about who they\\u2019re playing with. I think that because I\\u2019m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They\\u2019re definitely working something out. I\\u2019m not concerned about that part at all. I\\u2019m just concerned that both children don\\u2019t drown. I\\u2019m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They\\u2019re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they\\u2019re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They\\u2019re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they\\u2019re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I\\u2019m watching this happen and by this time I\\u2019ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I\\u2019m concerned and don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. She says, \\u201cThe train was raided by these police officers.\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get to it. We weren\\u2019t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.\\u201d I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She\\u2019s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she\\u2019s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it\\u2019s the thing that she\\u2019s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.\"],[\"I am with my lover - it\\u2019s not anyone I recognize from real life. He has tan skin and these piercing blue eyes. He\\u2019s not 100% white, he\\u2019s definitely a person of color. I\\u2019m in his bedroom. I\\u2019m naked. He\\u2019s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I\\u2019m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s mine, but I\\u2019m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It\\u2019s weird and doesn\\u2019t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It\\u2019s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It\\u2019s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I\\u2019m on my back. I can see my lover and he\\u2019s over me. He has a fork. He\\u2019s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?\\u201d This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s what I want, let\\u2019s go for that.\\u201d Then I do this weird thing while I\\u2019m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they\\u2019re scratching my skin with the fork. It\\u2019s like some very strange BDSM play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, this is what I want. Go for it. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But the lucid part of me is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?\\u201d I\\u2019m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I\\u2019m not enjoying at all. I\\u2019m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, \\u201cHere let me show you how to use your power now.\\u201d It\\u2019s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn\\u2019t. They say, \\u201cYeah okay, show us how.\\u201d They are truly wanting to learn. Somehow I have this queen-like presence, even though part of me sees this is not it. Then they are paid and they leave. Other people are showing up at the house, like we\\u2019re having a party. There are younger women - girls, maybe early 20s - who have shown up. I\\u2019m out on the back deck adjacent to the bedroom I was just in. The bedroom was huge with white gauzy curtains and the fancy netting over the bed. All the sheets and linens and carpet were white - everything was white in this room. I go out to the deck and some of these girls from the party show up. I\\u2019m switching out the rugs that were on the deck and right at the door to wipe your feet on. I\\u2019m showing these women how to pick the correct one that goes with the decor for this party.\"],[\"I am with my parents and we\\u2019re in a town that we\\u2019re visiting. My brothers are there, too, but not my sister. Events are happening in the town. We\\u2019re walking through the town with our tokens so we can take part in the events. I\\u2019m with my dad and we\\u2019re looking at a flyer that says something like: a couple tokens to do this talk with Mexican-Americans to hear their side of the story and get anti-racism training. My dad pays the money, but nothing happens and no one shows up. It\\u2019s a little mind boggling. We continue on and go see some other events. At one point, we\\u2019re in a car traveling and I\\u2019m the driver. I don\\u2019t know if I should be driving because I feel under the influence of something, not alcohol. I\\u2019ve got some friends in the back and maybe a sibling or two. At one part I drive over a bridge. The bridge is made of wood and it\\u2019s really, really high. I think there is water beneath the bridge. As I\\u2019m driving over it I think I should not be driving and I\\u2019m not safe to drive. We get over the bridge and I\\u2019m sweating because it\\u2019s freaking me out. We get to a downtown area where the buildings are close, the streets are narrow, and there are a lot of pedestrians. I\\u2019m very anxious to get the car parked back at the house becuase I\\u2019m scared I\\u2019m going to kill someone or everyone in the car. I still don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m on or why I have this anxiety around driving. Eventually we do get back to the house. I get out of the car. A bunch of people go inside. I go inside for a second. The house is interesting - it\\u2019s a very Victorian era looking house on the outside and inside. It\\u2019s got a lot of space - the ceilings are tall, which kind of contradicts the Victorian era architecture because the houses are usually kind of small on the inside. I\\u2019m inside for a little bit. I go to the backyard and the area where the Mexican-American anti-racism talk was supposed to happen is actually happening in the backyard. The landscape changes from town to lush woodland. The sign or billboard that announced the event is in the middle of the backyard. A tree is growing in the corner. I go hang out by this tree. The tree is actually a Mexican-American woman. I think she is Mexican-American, but she could be from some other part of South America, I\\u2019m not entirely sure, I just know she\\u2019s Latina. She has been in this tree the whole time. She comes out of the tree and we are dialoguing. She is scolding me for not doing what I was supposed to do in terms of my anti-racism work. But it\\u2019s more than that! As she becomes more human and less tree, the place where she was standing in the corner of the yard starts to fill with water. There\\u2019s a rocky waterfall in this back corner, too. I\\u2019m lying down on a mattress. I was trying to lie down under this tree while in conversation with this woman because there is something she\\u2019s supposed to be teaching me that I\\u2019m supposed to be learning. But where her roots were, the water keeps filling. At first it\\u2019s just a little trickle, and I scooch to the side to get out of the way. Then there\\u2019s more. The air mattress I was lying on starts to get soaked and I pull it out of the way. She is also trying to get out of the way. Then suddenly in this back corner of the yard that had nothing but this dry old tree woman is suddenly luscious and completely verdant. There are plants and ferns growing everywhere and there\\u2019s a spring where she was. The water is the sweetest water you\\u2019ve ever tasted; it\\u2019s so clear and refreshing. Now it\\u2019s overflowing out of the pond and moving down because this back corner of the yard was on top of a hill. So the water starts to flow down and it\\u2019s touching everything that was really dry. Everything about the town was also really dry - there weren't a lot of green growing things. So the water is moving down this hill and the whole backyard and surrounding areas change from this dry almost desert place to this green luscious verdant place. The whole backyard becomes a sanctuary. The tree woman and I keep trying to move out of the water, which is somehow creating a bond between us. In the beginning it was really hard for us to talk to each other; I was on the defence and she was attacking. But as we are together trying to move out of the water, there is a softening where she is more willing to talk to me and I\\u2019m not as scared to listen to her and hear what she has to say. We become friends. It\\u2019s interesting the way we start to weave together. We\\u2019re still in the backyard and there are also parrots with us. One of the parrots is talking to me. Eventually the woman wants to go walk downtown and go for dinner. We walk out together to the town. The town is actually kind of dirty and gross. We ask some people for directions to a really good dinner place. This guy tries to give us directions, then says, \\u201cNever mind, I\\u2019m just going to take you.\\u201d So he does. We follow him to this dinner place.\"],[\"I am with some people, I have a little ball and I want to roll it towards a wall and have it bounce back to me\\u2026.As part of a bigger process\\u2026.But I roll the ball too forcefully, and it does not go as I had hoped\\u2026.Lots of people are around, there is a good vibe, we are all doing something together\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with some people, trying to get our activities organized\\u2026.Everything in the room is black, the objects, the flowers\\u2026.At some point, a person eats a gummy candy, and later gets sick\\u2026.The powder of the candy is not good for you?....\"],[\"I am with someone on a beach\\u2026.They have a gun, and they are thinking about shooting other people\\u2026I say we did not fight World Wars I and II to let people just walking on the beach get shot at\\u2026.it is unclear if I am saying this, or if I am the person with the gun\\u2026.Then, everyone is in a white room, lots going on\\u2026.I am fooling around with a woman\\u2026.But she is later mistreated by others?....Later, someone has put a kind of magical love charm into an arrow tip? One half for mom, the other half for dad\\u2026.At some point I see my wife walking naked with another woman down a hallway\\u2026.I am aroused and admire her body\\u2026.Then, I see a dirt road curving along a hillside, and I notice how the road was formed here by pushing dirt toward the downhill side\\u2026.I see another pile of dirt pushed lower down the hill, along the crest of the ridge\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with the Queen trying to bring help to people\\u2026.Little household things, but important\\u2026.The people do not care, though\\u2026.Later, at a meeting of people, sitting at a table, maybe a PCR group gathering\\u2026.A woman is talking, Matilda?, suddenly I can tell she is going to say nice things about me\\u2026.She says and then there\\u2019s me [the dreamer], all shadowy, doing all the many things you do\\u2026.I am pleased at the praise, and slightly embarrassed at being singled out\\u2026.I notice as Matilda is speaking that she is surprisingly young and very attractive\\u2026.At another point, I am walking through a building, passing lots of people, old ladies, part of some process, and I suddenly realize I am not wearing a mask\\u2026.oh no, that is terrible of me, dangerous to others, and to me\\u2026.I am very anxious and wonder why no one said anything to me, to remind me\\u2026.I simply forgot\\u2026.\"],[\"I am working with a woman on a project\\u2026.Little drops of water sprinkle around at one point, I am unsure if that is a good or a bad thing\\u2026.it is a pretty display, in any case\\u2026.Other people treat the woman like a child\\u2026.Later, a tall man carries each of us on his shoulders, like we are children\\u2026.\"],[\"I am working with Amy from the \\u201cBrooklyn 99\\u201d tv show on some kind of project, with other people, moving things around in a building\\u2026.I wonder, is it ok for them to have on their police uniforms while they do this?....there is some question about whether we should put some of the things into a special cardboard carrier, like for wine bottles\\u2026.\"],[\"I barely get into the front door. I just make it up the stairs, slip in and shut the door. It\\u2019s night and something has been following me. People are inside making crafts at a table. My friend Elizabeth has kimono fabric and is pulling gold thread out of the fabric to use as thread for a doll dress. She\\u2019s helping me make one. As I try to shut the door, two feral dogs sneak in - one black and one white. I try to push them out the door. They push back in. I push them back out and am able to lock the door. But then they\\u2019re behind me in the house and I wonder how that happened. I unlock and open the door and push them back out. This happens several times until I realize they\\u2019ve been coming in through a broken screen. I see it hanging off its hinges. So I\\u2019m trying to get them out of the house and also fix the screen. It goes on and on and I\\u2019m getting really upset. I\\u2019m also a little afraid of these dogs and what they might do to me. Then somehow I keep them out. I\\u2019m sitting at the table with the old kimono fabric. Elizabeth gives me the gold thread with needle and I start sewing the pieces together. Then someone is in the back bedroom. I\\u2019m not sure if they are sick or if I am being taken to the dark room to be punished for doing something bad.\"],[\"I came up with the idea in a dream to write a story about a character becoming a cop in these times.\"],[\"I can barely remember but I can remember they are from established works.\"],[\"I can only recall theme's. Like if i am watching a war movie, i might dream about being in a war or battle, or if I am watching something scary, I will dream about being chased by a killer, or animal if that is the theme of the movie.\"],[\"I can only remember two bits from an extensive dream. I\\u2019m walking down a city street. There are steps leading up to a second story restaurant. It\\u2019s an elegant cafe. I go up the stairs with my son. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I\\u2019m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we\\u2019ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I\\u2019ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he\\u2019s gone. He\\u2019s not on the stairs. I\\u2019m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s gone. In another scene, I\\u2019m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I\\u2019m at the baths. I\\u2019m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She\\u2019s watching the cat while the cat\\u2019s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I\\u2019m trying to pretend that I don\\u2019t know Ursula so that the woman doesn\\u2019t connect me with Ursula\\u2019s former apprentice.\"],[\"I can see a pair of motorcycles and a thing that has three wheels, like the comfy ride for old people who want to ride motorcycles, but can\\u2019t stay on two wheels. I\\u2019m observing all of this and don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m in this part of the dream. So these two women riding these motorcycles are pretty fucking badass and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re going pretty fast. There\\u2019s a dude in this three-wheeler behind them. He\\u2019s kind of reckless and pushing him from behind. They\\u2019re weaving in and out of cars and traffic. The feeling of it is really dangerous. There aren\\u2019t a lot of cars. The road itself is going through wheat fields and forest on the other side of the road. The terrain keeps changing as everyone is speeding through this. There\\u2019s also a bus behind that\\u2019s kind of following. I\\u2019m going back and forth between hovering over the motorcycles watching and being in the bus and talking to the bus driver. I\\u2019m watching these motorcycles and at one point I see the guy in the three-wheeler veer off into a wheat field and destroy a bunch of the wheat. Then he comes back onto the road and is still behind these women. The feeling of this part is really intense - the sounds of the motorcycles are really loud in my ear. The wheels of the motorcycles and the three-wheeler are cartoonishly big. There are other passengers in the bus. The inside of the bus is like a school bus, the way the seats are set up, but the outside of the bus doesn\\u2019t look like a school bus. I don\\u2019t know who the bus driver is - it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. He has a wise demeanor about him - he has the feeling of being a guide in this dream. I\\u2019m watching and then the scene cuts away into some sort of night club or bar. I\\u2019m leaning against a bar and talking to these two men whose eyes are a light piercing blue with a light behind them. There\\u2019s definitely flirting going on between us. There\\u2019s a mirror behind the bartender where all the alcohol is sitting on shelves. It\\u2019s dim inside. I know that the people on the motorcycles are safe and fine. I see that the guy that was pushing them on is back on the bus. The bus is now a lab and he\\u2019s standing in this metal cage with rings. The metal cage is very close to his body but not actually touching him. There\\u2019s one ring around his knees, another around his hips and another around his chest. His hands are tied behind him and his body is all bruised. His hair is red. His skin is pretty pale. He\\u2019s yelling as if there\\u2019s some sort of punishment happening to him in this bus that has turned into a lab. So one part of my attention is on that and another part of my attention is with these two guys. It almost feels like they\\u2019re trying to distract me from what\\u2019s happening to this other dude in the bus. I keep seeing electricity coming out from the contraption that he\\u2019s in and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s making him scream. Then just like a scene fades in a movie, the lights go down on the guy in the bus/lab. The lights were an eerie blue and then they fade away totally. I\\u2019m left in the bar and the lights have a red tinge even though they\\u2019re dim.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t find my husband. I\\u2019m at some kind of party at a country club or public pool. First I get a video call from my mom and sister. She\\u2019s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She\\u2019s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I\\u2019m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I\\u2019m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he\\u2019s actually swimming. He\\u2019s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I\\u2019m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can\\u2019t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I\\u2019m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he\\u2019s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I\\u2019m so mad at him. And he\\u2019s just shrugging me off. He tells me that he\\u2019s been doing other stuff, too, and not telling me about it: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been drinking six cups of coffee a day, drinking beer everyday, getting high everyday and smoking cigarettes again. I\\u2019ve been hiding from you the whole time because I know how upset you get.\\u201d I\\u2019m so mad that I want to beat him up. The woman comes back. She\\u2019s watching and smoking. She has tattoos all over her body and they aren\\u2019t well done or tastefully designed. She lifts up her shirt to show her belly. I can see she is very far along. The baby is lying sideways which isn\\u2019t good. I\\u2019m continuing to get more mad. She asks him where to send the invoice for the cigarettes. He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It\\u2019s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It\\u2019s \\u201cWhyNotHard\\u201d or \\u201cWhyNot&Hard\\u201d or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. I\\u2019m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he\\u2019s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we\\u2019re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together.

I\\u2019ve ridden my bike to her place and park it in the garage. She meets me there. We\\u2019re talking about whatever it is she needs to talk about it. We go upstairs into her apartment and we have our session. She\\u2019s talking about actually having another baby with her partner, which is a big deal because it would have to be in vitro fertilization. She already has another child who is a little bit older. At a certain point she has to go pick them up, so we end our session after talking. She goes into her bedroom and grabs another child - a younger child, a little black orphan baby that she has adopted. It was not an infant, maybe 3 or 4 or 5, had been sleeping in the bedroom the whole time and I didn\\u2019t know. She puts the child in a front carrier, straps in, and heads out. We\\u2019re both heading out back down the stairs from her apartment to her garage where my bike is and her car is. I\\u2019m just surprised that there was another child in the apartment the whole time and apparently sleeping, but it didn\\u2019t come up in our conversation either. I thought it was so strange. She goes out. She leaves with her other child to pick up her child from school. I get my bike and start riding it down the street because I\\u2019m heading towards an Imbolc festival. As I\\u2019m riding my bike, I get off and walk. I\\u2019m walking down the main street that I grew up on in my childhood. I\\u2019m seeing the mountains to my right - they\\u2019re beautiful, covered in green grass and I can see the tree line. Then of course I can see all of the houses - the regular neighborhoods that I passed every day in my childhood. I\\u2019m heading down to the high school I went to as I was growing up and that is where the festival is. So I cross the little bridge that has a stream under it and I take a right into the school and I make it right past the cattle gate into the main entrance and set my bike down. I also have this strange lingering feeling that I have my own children I\\u2019m supposed to be watching. They show up at the school and I take them in and bring them through the entrance where I pay for admission. My old mentor who I learned some of my priestessing skills in my priestess apprenticeship is there. She is there to take us all on a guided journey before I get into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s me and whoever else has shown up at the entrance of the gate, which I find interesting because she\\u2019s only taking the people who have been trained as priestesses to go do this meditation, and two of the other women that I see there - besides the women I went through the program with - are actually high school classmates of mine who tell me, \\u201cOh yeah, we started this program five years ago. We\\u2019ve always been priestesses.\\u201d I\\u2019m really shocked because I didn\\u2019t see them the entire time I was on the program and also I feel a little bit betrayed, like I had been told that the group of us that had been going through the program was it and to find out there were other people that we didn\\u2019t know about in our spiral is very disturbing to me. We lay down anyway and we\\u2019re going through this meditation. I can hear my mentor\\u2019s voice and she says very specific words, which I cannot remember now. But there\\u2019s also a part where she sprinkles turmeric and saffron over us - those are the two herbs we are meant to be using with this meditation. And then I can feel my body taking in the herbs, taking in the words - there\\u2019s definitely a change in what feels like my consciousness and my field. When it\\u2019s done, I get up and I know it\\u2019s time for me to leave. I\\u2019m not supposed to stay there with the other priestesses or the people she had brought in to do this blessing. I head into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s interesting, I can see yellow tulips everywhere. These tulips seem to be playing an important part of this Imbolc festival. Then I leave because I\\u2019m still so upset about these two women who were my high school classmates who also suddenly turned out to be these priestesses that I didn\\u2019t know that they were. They have some disdain and contempt for me because I had left the path early and I don\\u2019t like any of it. So I leave the festival and somehow the scene changes completely. I\\u2019m in a home with my mom and my dad and my dad is trying to keep the inside of the house - I think it was supposed to be my childhood home - he\\u2019s trying to keep it in order, keep it clean. My mom is in another section of the house - her office - and there\\u2019s her and a bunch of people in it and they\\u2019re all brainstorming jobs - how to work, how to make money. They\\u2019re making the assumption that I\\u2019m part of it, I\\u2019m going to start working it. But I\\u2019m actually in the office trying to brainstorm my own programs, my own classes, my own way to get more clients. They keep including me in their discussion and finally I get really pissed off and start yelling. I grab their papers they\\u2019ve been writing on and tear them up, rip them up. They finally say oh, okay, she\\u2019s not going to help with that and they go back to writing on their whiteboards brainstorming. I\\u2019m so annoyed that I get up and head out to a restaurant that they apparently also own. I can\\u2019t tell if both my parents own it or just one, but I go to the restaurant and there\\u2019s this pressure on me to help work in that restaurant too and I do not want to, but I do need money. So I go into the restaurant and it\\u2019s interesting because a different classmate is a server in the restaurant and there\\u2019s another man - two men are in there. They sit me down and they walk me through the way this restaurant works and how the emphasis is on kindness to the employees, which is so different from the restaurant experience I have where everyone is cutthroat and the chefs brandish knives at you and whatnot. So they are explaining to me how the restaurant works and how my duties would be as manager and how little I would have to do. I\\u2019m still not sold, I don\\u2019t want to work at a restaurant, I\\u2019ve already done that. While we\\u2019re sitting down at the meeting, people are coming into the restaurant and eating. Things are flowing. I can hear glasses clinking and silverware being used and orders being yelled out and lots of conversation. I look to my right and there\\u2019s this huge square table with 12 people sitting at it and they\\u2019re singing to a cat trying to communicate to the cat to do something. The cat is actually responding to it - it reminds me of snake charmers and all of these students know exactly what they\\u2019re doing. They\\u2019re communicating to this cat through singing, all 12 of them, and they are getting the cat to do what they want it to do and I\\u2019m just fascinated watching this happen. Then my attention goes back to the two guys I\\u2019m in the meeting with and I just tell them, \\u201cit\\u2019s lovely, you\\u2019re lovely, the restaurant seems lovely. The restaurant seems to run quite well, but I\\u2019m not interested. I don\\u2019t want to work in a restaurant.\\u201d Then the scene changes again, but I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest of the dream.\"],[\"I have an orange football helmet, with some other equipment\\u2026.it is newly painted, and has no team insignia on it?....the paint looks cheap, tacky, not smooth; an amateur job, not for professional use\\u2026.Later, I leave a room with other people in it, and we have something that other people want\\u2026.a long white object, plastic or wood?\\u2026.I put it on a book shelf and try to cover it with handfuls of dirt\\u2026.hmm, that does not seem to work well\\u2026.they will still be able to see it\\u2026.I think of putting a blanket over the book shelf, a brown one, to cover the whole thing\\u2026.But they would definitely notice that\\u2026.hmm, what to do\\u2026.Earlier, the Divinity School professors are trying to guide me in how to divide up the night into different dream parts\\u2026.\"],[\"I have but I don't remember specifics now\"],[\"I have come up with a way of responding to the crisis\\u2026.A strange ball made of four natural elements, kinds of plants\\u2026.It does well, I am happy with it\\u2026.A plant vine, like a long line of string, is wrapped around it, when the ball goes off or activates, that vine withers and dies\\u2026.it has to be replaced each time\\u2026.\"],[\"I have dreamed about the chaos and destruction created by these racially motivated hate groups.

I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It\\u2019s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I\\u2019m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It\\u2019s warm so I don\\u2019t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I\\u2019m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I\\u2019ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I\\u2019m headed back in their direction. As I\\u2019m walking down the street, I\\u2019m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There\\u2019s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there\\u2019s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there\\u2019s very tall windows - they\\u2019re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it\\u2019s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I\\u2019m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I\\u2019m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She\\u2019s talking to her daughter. She\\u2019s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there\\u2019s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that\\u2019s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I\\u2019m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I\\u2019m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There\\u2019s an awkwardness now because I don\\u2019t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She\\u2019s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I\\u2019ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I\\u2019m wearing doesn\\u2019t have any pockets and I also suddenly can\\u2019t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I\\u2019m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I\\u2019m so distraught and I wonder if it\\u2019s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don\\u2019t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.\"],[\"I only remember images ... of Brad Pitt ...

We left through the back door when the man came home. We got to the movie theater and ordered red wine and when we sat down, there was a young woman between us and I realized she was the mistress.

We went to a bar and by the end we had sung karaoke and ripped up our dresses - suddenly I was wearing a long wedding dress and it was ripped to my knees and glitter/color all over it like a Cyndi Lauper video or something.

It was all brown people from different ethnic backgrounds. I was taught how to do the job but I wasn\\u2019t doing it well. There was this Beautiful man, Naveen Andrews, that lives there and he was helping me get acclimated. There were seminars every day in the courtyard. Everyone was so calm and collected and moved so gracefully. I didn\\u2019t. My stuff was everywhere. My motorcycle was in the middle of the impeccably landscaped garden and I had to move it out during a seminar and it was so distracting and noisy and awkward. I had my first tour I was giving and I had all the paperwork for each person and they all were completely different but I could only remember one name and I kept calling them all the same name, Sheera. I was so embarrassed. I sold one house to one of the people who was In love with Naveen. She also hated me for being so close with him.\"],[\"I was at a beach with a couple of friends and the only one I recognize is my friend, who is a lifestyle dom and I\\u2019ve really had a good time observing her and working with her and getting to know about being a dom from her. In the dream we are at the ocean. We\\u2019re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it\\u2019s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I\\u2019m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She\\u2019s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We\\u2019re on a culdesac. It\\u2019s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I\\u2019m not sure whose. I\\u2019m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it\\u2019s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I\\u2019m not sure. There are adults and kids. I\\u2019m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I\\u2019m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I\\u2019m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cCould you hurry up? You\\u2019re taking a long time and why do you need that?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBecause I like it.\\u201d Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn\\u2019t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don\\u2019t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there\\u2019s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn\\u2019t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, \\u201cWhy am I taking off this thing that I like?\\u201d I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn\\u2019t like it and was all judgmental about it. The dream ends there with that going through my head.\"],[\"I was at a hospital training on a surgical unit. The patients were hoisted up into the ceiling rather than on beds and I was being trained how to clean them before they were discharged. It involved spray and turning myself clockwise once. I don\\u2019t remember much else except that I was wearing blue scrubs, not my teal scrubs\"],[\"I was at a house in the kitchen and I\\u2019ve never been there before. It was older and everything was worn down and white but cared for- my ex was there and he was angry. I don\\u2019t know why. I was cleaning up a broken garbage bag on the floor and trying to put everything inside of the next one and it kept poking through and I realized they were brooms and brushes and of course they would poke through. Someone came to the door and it was a whole group of people who were actually banging on the door. There was a redhead woman wearing a pink dress and I think she was a trans woman and she said she needed to marry her wife and now she couldn\\u2019t. The men behind her looked threatening and we let her inside.\"],[\"i was at a protest like the one i really attended but when the cops threw the gas i wasnt prepared like i was in real life and it hurt so bad and i fell and they arrested me. i was crying and asking them what i did but they wouldnt listen\"],[\"I was at a protest/march/action in an urban street setting, surrounded by buildings.

It was night.\"],[\"I was at what was supposed to be my unit but it was on the first floor of some place and much larger and spread out, much nicer. There was a patient I\\u2019ve had dreams about before (about driving around in circles in a yellow van and another strapped down in makeshift restraints). In this dream I walked in and the attending was taking vitals - it wasn\\u2019t the one that works with them at all on the unit and it seemed off because attendings don\\u2019t take vitals. I could tell the attending was nervous and there was tension, like the attending just wanted to leave the room. I tried to engage with them and we went outside and there were big balls splattered with blue and red paint and we kicked them back and forth; and they liked it because it looked like blood. They were asking me personal questions that I was trying to avoid. Eventually I excused myself and went to sleep in the next room.\"],[\"I was at work and my colleague erased my quote from the board...I wasn\\u2019t mad I was just confused\"],[\"I was at work and there were three computers and I had to put my password into the computer where everyone could see it. The unit secretary reminded me to check the box for the \\u201cwasher-dryer\\u201d to give myself access (not sure what this means) and there were options for all kinds of things that didn\\u2019t apply to my job. Patients were being wheeled in and I looked at my watch and it was on but the clock face was facing down so all I saw was the back of the watch. A patient came in in restraints like you see in the movies (not like we actually have) and he was sitting up in a chair and basically the chair had wood and he was strapped to the wood. He looked over at me with such vitriol but I could see he wasn\\u2019t really there and I wanted to take off the restraints. At the same time I felt he was dangerous (something I don\\u2019t often feel). He was white with brown wavy medium length hair, maybe early twenties. He creeped me out. He looks like someone we have on unit who is not as acute. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was at work and trying to get ready for a group. The hallways were cluttered and there were people everywhere and visitors (which we don\\u2019t have anymore). I went out to the waiting area and it was like a completely different hospital. I saw a guy and asked him if there\\u2019s anything else I could do - just to be nice. He said he wanted a map. I pointed him in the direction of the station for guest services and then I went over to the guest service station. But somebody cut me off and I had to wait to get them up and she told me it was because she had an appointment and she was a billion package. I was annoyed but I waited so I got him set up to leave the hospital. Then I went back on my unit to get ready and everyone was due to me, so I was trying to assess people and invite them down to group. People were on computers in the group room which is also not a thing that we have, but I had to manually turn them off. Somebody got physical with me and I had to put my arm out to protect myself. In the dream I was angry and tired and impatient but pretending that I wasn\\u2019t and that\\u2019s how I feel a lot in real life right now. I\\u2019m really tired and a lot of people are asking me for things and I have nothing to give.\"],[\"I was at work on the voluntary side, although it didn\\u2019t really look like it does now - it was much bigger. I was holding an impromptu group with a couple folks. Two women and one man came over and we were doing a beading exercise and nursing him to get them to go do other things. I was left with the gentleman and one of his nurses came through but she was wheeling a walking wheelchair and she was like, \\u201coh this is a much better fit than what I had to use yesterday.\\u201d I forget what she was in yesterday, but in my dream it was somewhat adaptive, and I turned to him and I said, \\u201cIt never worked out well.\\u201d My dad worked at the hospital when I was a kid and he was a veteran. In my dream this guy trusted me more. Then we lined everybody up to go back to the involuntary side and there were these two double doors and this big bright light. I had to keep opening the badge to let people through without the thing buzzing - similar to what we have but the bright light was really strange.\"],[\"I was at work. I kept logging onto the computers to turn the chart and do things and these cartoons kept coming up. Then my colleague Susan came in, but she wasn\\u2019t wearing her scrubs. Her student Lana came and she and I were watching Susan run a group. I had to keep turning south of people so they couldn\\u2019t see me typing on the screen. When I went back to the computer, I saw there was some dancing on the screen and a place like Shambhala and a voice said, \\u201clet\\u2019s give a dance to the creator.\\u201d I remember feeling annoyed by this but don\\u2019t know why.\"],[\"I was being chased by somebody or something and running from building to building and then I kind of melted into the second dream where I had my dog Pinto in his stroller and we were meeting my family for a Christmas show. We took an elevator to the top floor of what looks like the space needle in Seattle and we sat down at the end of this crescent shaped couch. I kind of had a bad view of the play or festivities, but then an unattractive guy sat down next to me. He was black and tall and wearing a gray sweater and jeans and boots. He was sitting with people that he knew. We all said hello and then we went around and said our names twice. The play started and I couldn\\u2019t see my family but I was okay and somehow the guy next to me put his arm around me and started kissing me. He was a really good kisser and in my dream I remember thinking it\\u2019s been so long and I was embarrassed because I felt like there was so much spit in my mouth! I eventually excused myself to use the restroom but before I did I looked down and my nipple was showing! I left Pinto there in the stroller while I went to the bathroom and I was gone for a while, maybe seven or eight minutes, and I was blowing my nose trying to get the last of everything out because my nose was running. When I went back I was worried about having left him alone for so long and then the person next to me wasn\\u2019t there anymore but it was okay. The show was almost over and then I woke up\"],[\"I was closer to the top of the water and then on top of the water. I\\u2019m not watching from the boat, maybe on a dock? I was with my ex Rory and he was judging these people and their kids as they were getting out their slide for the boat. They had a little kid and a very short slide. The little kid had some kind of floaty device on his left leg. Every time somebody went down the slide it got longer. I had to explain this to him and he finally understood and was less judgmental.\"],[\"I was doing something with my sister Liz who is older and we were having an outdoor party and there were configurations of people and we needed to figure out where they were going to be under the tent. She changed it and told everybody about it and took credit for changing it. For some reason this annoyed me and in real life this is something she would do and I would let it go because I don\\u2019t care. We were serving American food and Indian food and I don\\u2019t know why it was a big deal or a faux pas but it was definitely a problem to combine the two. I think there were fireworks too and the whole dream was at night.\"],[\"I was down by the ocean and it was another time. I was alone and there was no beach to sit on, just small patches of rock with some exposed sand. Everyone knew each other but I didn\\u2019t. The first part of the dream I met this guy and we dated briefly. I don\\u2019t remember his face or anything. He had an annoying brother who looked like a Jonas brother and a loud car. It reminded me a bit of the feeling of this fling I had in college after my mom died with a guy who raced cars. I know this is going nowhere but whatever. Very unintentional, not something I would do now. When we broke up he took my phone and dropped it down the stairs and it dropped way down and I was on my knees scrambling to find the pieces. I was mad.\"],[\"I was dreaming that I was in this cabin with 5 or 6 different people I didn't know\"],[\"I was driving down this road going over the speed limit. The sign said 50, although it was in a neighborhood so I knew it was over, and I missed a stop sign. It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow\\u2019s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I\\u2019ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids. Then I went to drive around looking for a gift of plates but all of the stores were closed. I remember bashing Trump in a few conversations.\"],[\"I was driving in the same universe but in a car. I stopped into a small town and it was snowing. There was a movie theater and a menswear shop. I went into the shop and saw a friend of a friend who I knew from working in San Francisco a long time ago. I haven\\u2019t seen or thought of them in years. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was driving to a concert at night with ex boyfriend Rory and when we arrived it was my late husband Caleb singing. I think it was the afterlife. There was a woman singing and she was really into it. She said \\u201cI think I remember you from last time\\u201d and I introduced myself as Caleb\\u2019s wife and her face fell. Her name was Dawn Jo. It was dark.

He seemed nice though so I thought I would try. He lived on campus, maybe he was a teacher or something. I was definitely not me. I went to his apartment and we had dinner and eventually started to kiss. It was a nice concert and I remember taking our shirts off and then I left to go for some fresh air and I left him waiting for me for a long time. Then I went to this big brick courtyard and all of these people came. There were multiple layers and then all these black bars started closing in like we were getting locked down and somebody handed me a little toy truck to place and wedge in the door so that we could keep the door open. It was a young guy so I did that. And then I got free and I went down to the bottom level and there was this overgrown garden and all these people and there were these fish swimming without water and they were clear like puffy fish, kind of scary looking. They were all over the grass but they were swimming and on top of the grass and they were using the very length of their body to propel them forward. I remember being scared of them. I couldn\\u2019t tell if they were jellyfish or what they were and I had big wide open eyes. There were also regular animals, like ducks and squirrels. I was all over the place trying to get out of there. And then there was this other guy that I came across while I was running away and he caught me in my game and said, \\u201cha ha, I know you\\u2019re running away you\\u2019re gonna wait for me, too,\\u201d and then he took me back around the front of the building and that\\u2019s when I saw the first guy I ran away from and he told me how hurt he was.\"],[\"I was having a dream of an actor, John.

I saw these guys playing basketball with their shirts off and was aroused. I realized I was rooming with them. I went to go get dinner and it spilled all over me; this one guy came to talk to me and we started to hit it off but then he was telling me about two failed marriages and how awful all of his exes were and it was such an icky familiar feeling. He was white with thick brown hair, probably in his forties and built well for his age, very east coast. But I was like \\u201cnope!\\u201d Then a younger black guy came to sit with me and he was sharing that he is a doctor at NYU and basically prequalifying me about my masters and asking if I was going to do my PhD. I felt overwhelmed and left to take a shower. I was trying to get undressed without being seen, in a thick towel in this big shared room. I looked out the window and it was New York or something and I saw hand prints on the window of a neighboring building and skeletons but thought maybe they were Halloween decorations. When I went to go back downstairs I was at my job now and going to the OT room to get my cart and get the group ready. \\u201cNo Diggity\\u201d was playing on the radio.

I make it to this one level. It\\u2019s pretty high up. I can see out the windows and all I can see is clouds. I can\\u2019t even see the ground. There is green lightning outside. I\\u2019m still running away from this guy and he\\u2019s definitely chasing me. I make it to this place that is all windows and I can see in all directions from where I am in this room. There\\u2019s a table in the center of the room. I\\u2019m making an altar with crystals. If I can make this crystal grid and turn it on fast enough, then I can transport myself out of this. But my brother is there and he\\u2019s slowing me the fuck down. I need two of the crystals that he has. They\\u2019re tiny -the size of my pinky fingernail. They are shaped like triangles and black obsidian. He has those two stones and they\\u2019re his. I have them in my hand and he comes running up and says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t use my stones to get out of here. You\\u2019re not allowed to get out of here.\\u201d He\\u2019s somehow on Voldemort's side?! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, we have to get out of here! Or at least I have to. I don\\u2019t care if you like working for this guy and this is your jam. Cool. But I\\u2019m not staying.\\u201d But he keeps taking his stones off the grid so I can\\u2019t complete the grid and I can see Voldemort in his robes and walking down the hall towards me. His robes are flapping. Now there\\u2019s lightning outside and it\\u2019s getting very dramatic. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I cannot finish the grid because my brother keeps taking his stones out and I don\\u2019t have enough time to activate it. It\\u2019s like I get a few seconds with the stones on the grid and then he takes them and I can\\u2019t do it again. The dream ends with me being terrified and freaked out that I\\u2019m going to be stuck as a prisoner of this tower forever, and frustrated because I can\\u2019t get the grid to go. I know how to do this kind of magic and it shouldn\\u2019t be this hard for me.\"],[\"I was in a yoga studio and crammed in trying to go to class and I couldn\\u2019t see the teacher and I was annoyed at the people around me because they were acting really immature.\"],[\"I was in an anteroom of sorts getting ready to see Ram Dass. An attendant sat with me and I washed and we sat. Then I went to a room and he was in a bed with only his head propped up. The bed was a four-poster and the headboard was like a gold metal shell behind him. I sat down on the floor and he asked about playing a card game. I didn\\u2019t like it - was short and long at the same time. Other fragments: dark New York City passages from target and apartment buildings to each other running from police. A foursome in a bathroom in a public place, but it was like a regular bathroom. Big boxes. A drive through. Rory\\u2019s dad was in a bathroom and we had to take a picture with him like Santa and it was the worst and there was all kinds of family history.\"],[\"I was in Asia and in a crowded bustling city at night. I was with two companions but they didn\\u2019t talk to me. I had several iPhones. We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I\\u2019m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn\\u2019t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn\\u2019t have it. I was staying alone in a hotel room that was like a train compartment and then it was dark and raining. I woke up sweating.\"],[\"I was in Germany while the Berlin Wall was still up; I was marching with other protesters calling for a united Germany, free movement, and the end of discrimination based on ethnicity. Then I was at the Chicago police riots 68, and a march on Washington after Kent State. I woke up remembering that that had really happened in my lifetime.\"],[\"I was in Hawaii for a Yoga Festival and my wallet was stolen while I was in the communal shower. The Tax Lady (Ex-Friend & Ex-Mentor, Candace) was there to help, but I did not feel safe. . .Maybe because she betrayed me and my husband??\"],[\"I was in my apartment and it was the beginning of the day. I had just tried to ride my bike to work in the dark and had to turn around (something I don\\u2019t do in real life). It was still dark in the morning. I thought maybe my dog peed because it smelled like urine in the kitchen and I saw bees in a puddle on the floor. I wanted to get them out of here, so I got a swiffer and a paper towel and thought I killed them (I normally don\\u2019t kill bugs; I catch and release). When I turned around they were flying and on my window but they were monarch butterflies. They said they wanted to negotiate something and had reached out to the New York Times. We weren\\u2019t talking but communicating. It was amazing. I opened the balcony door and said to go and come back later when my lights were on. One of them said they would do some self care and then come over. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was in my childhood home. We were going to have a party there, a homecoming. I had to sort through tons of things that I left behind that were in huge piles. The inside of the house had completely rotted, like it had been abandoned and was left in ruins but with stuff everywhere. The lights didn\\u2019t work. Plants were growing through the floorboards. Spider webs everywhere. A spider landed on my face and I couldn't get it off like it was Velcro. It was huge, like a tarantula. My sister tried to get it off but couldn\\u2019t. I clawed at it on my forehead and pulled off a leg but it still wouldn\\u2019t budge. Finally it crawled to the top of my head and my sister pulled it out and threw it. Then we started sorting through the piles and ended up in a grappling fight over some sewing needles and thread that we both claimed were ours. After we fought we had to continue cleaning the place. People came over, aunts and uncles I haven\\u2019t seen for a decade, cousins, friends. And there was a woman named Mim. She was young and Chinese. She was taking care of me. She kept telling me that she was inspired by me for getting out of town and making a new life for myself. It\\u2019s what she wanted to do also and didn\\u2019t know how.\"],[\"I was in some kind of basement sorting through big broken picture frames and there was glass all over the floor. There were black trash bags and my arms were full. Someone called me on a phone and I pulled it out, it was an old phone like the flip razor phones. Who was it? I can\\u2019t remember now but it might have been my mom who has passed. I remember feeling sad. There was blood on the ground but I didn\\u2019t stop what I was doing. I just kept trying to work to meet the deadline or something. Then I realized it was 3:30 and I had missed the appointment for the spa (from earlier dream) and I was mad at myself and about to call the woman and explain that I lost track of time somehow but I couldn\\u2019t explain where I was. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was in the dark and my older sister was there as well as my ex. She left her husband around the same time I left my ex and there were many similarities both between her and him (she used anger as an outlet on me growing up and the primary reason I left was his explosive anger). I\\u2019m close with her now and her husband had explosive anger towards her...I am more avoidant of it. I freeze. In any case, in the dream there was a tree growing into a house porch and it was dark outside. I don\\u2019t remember what happened except we were looking for someone and I felt panicked.\"],[\"I was in the Harry Potter series as a character replacement to Hermione, I had the same thoughts and personality as her only I turned into a death eater.\"],[\"I was in the house and it wasn\\u2019t day or night; it was a greenish kind of gray. My first love boyfriend from high school William was there. I forgot that sometimes I dream about him but it\\u2019s been awhile. He was silent most of the time. I showed up with a group of people - a woman and an older woman who was like her mother or grandmother of Asian descent and then another younger woman. I can\\u2019t remember if I know her in real life. I really had to use the bathroom and there was this joke that every time I had to use the bathroom the older woman would cut me off but I didn\\u2019t have to use the bathroom when I woke up in real life I went back to sleep and I continued to dream. I dreamed I walked into a bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I was wearing three sports bras. It looks like they were on backwards almost but I checked and they weren\\u2019t, they were just really high on my chest and I want to try to use the toilet but it was a strange strange toilet and looks like a tub filled with water and I didn\\u2019t want to pee in that and so I thought maybe I should wait. Then William came in and I asked him and he said that I could use the toilet in the other room. He pulled back a door and there was an old-school old-fashioned regular toilet and I realized I was in a future, but I was also in the past. We planned to hook up later. We went to into the water together. It was like a soaking tub and so nice.\"],[\"I was in the most beautiful store/bazaar searching for sound healing instruments. There were so many rooms and staircases and shelves and items everywhere, imbued with magic. It was never ending. I picked up this beautiful branch with many smaller branches on it and tons of like seed pods attached, filled with seeds. So when I shook it gently, it sounded like rain. It was like a thousand tiny rattles.\"],[\"I was in these underwater Jacuzzi areas and I was chatting with the security guard Arshis and one or two other men. It was almost like I was holding my breath underwater and it was some kind of contest and we were in some kind of maze under the sea. There were these elaborate rooms and rings of hallways but it was all open to the sea at the same time, it\\u2019s hard to explain... and I was able to move through each of these areas very skillfully. The water was really warm (like hot tub warm) and there was some kind of light from a fire source somewhere at the bottom of the ocean.\"],[\"I was interviewing for a job and I had boils all over my face. I had to borrow somebody\\u2019s old beat up car and I had to return it after the job interview but I had to get to a race and then to my moms and I wasn\\u2019t sure how I was going to get anywhere.\"],[\"I was interviewing someone, I was talking to friends about black history.\"],[\"I was living on the second floor of the duplex building, a cluster of duplexes somewhere where it was really bright outside and really flat but I\\u2019ve never been there before. I have a feeling like I was hiding away and I remember hearing noise coming from my apartment. I open the door and then it was silent. The next part of my dream I was already in the car with a bunch of young boys but I was also younger. I\\u2019m actually not sure it was me this time but I was wearing cut off jeans and hiding something in my back pocket that I didn\\u2019t want them to see so I asked if I could use a restroom and they pulled over to a gas station then I got out of the car and remember looking at a pile of rubble wondering if I should do something about it before I went inside. Next, I went in and there were these old men leering at me. I tried to avoid eye contact with them and found my way to a bathroom. Then I woke up. When I woke up I thought I smelled the distinct smell of red wine-but I have not had red wine in my room or anywhere near my apartment. [nap dream]\"],[\"I was me I think and I was with a group of other people I\\u2019ve never met. We were at a store of some kind, maybe a children\\u2019s store and people were not wearing masks. Something happened: one of the men was bad and he got injured. He tried to take me and run away but I ran with another woman and I didn\\u2019t quite trust her either. We were suddenly driving at night on the streets where I grew up (kinda) and all the kids were camped out in tents on the football and soccer fields at night and only some of them were wearing masks.\"],[\"I was missing a mask and terrified of being near people. But people kept getting close and everyone was marching and everyone was happy and I was trying to act happy too and not let on how scared I was.\"],[\"I was moving out of a room or suite from my best friend Aidan\\u2019s house and she was helping me move. We have packed up all the boxes and are making sure we have everything. There are all these clear containers. Then I was getting dressed and she was carrying everything down faster than I could. When we walked out her mom was lounging around outside and there were all these stairs, lots and lots of stairs. I said a joke about how she was a Sherpa and it was really funny. Then Aidan and I went out somewhere and it was during the pandemic but we were in high school like we were when we were best friends and yet we were both wearing our work clothes for some reason and my badge had University Health care. It was hard to see and it said 9 to 5 and we went into this police station or Fireman's gym and they really go \\u201c95\\u201d like it was the call number for a place that they knew. I was embarrassed to tell them it was a particular university, but 925 meant something in the dream.\"],[\"I was not me. I think I was a younger person, maybe this younger girl I\\u2019ve been before in some dreams - she might have been black (I ran with an older woman through a field or something in that other dream). This felt like her but a different time period. I was posting signs on a telephone pole but not with a stapler - with tape - and they wouldn\\u2019t stick so I had to use a lot of tape and the edges kept peeling away. The wood on the pole was thick and smokey and charred like a fresh new pole but also alive somehow. I was communicating with someone about something but I started to wake up. The colors in the dream - it was dark like night and shades of purple and blue but I remember looking up at the stars and they were bright. I wanted to go back but I woke up sweating again and had to pee.\"],[\"I was on a cruise or some kind of family summer camp and had played a few rounds of an interactive scavenger hunt - I think something active maybe paintball and I sat down at a table with a family that I know and then there was a family that I didn\\u2019t know. The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn\\u2019t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I\\u2019ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn\\u2019t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn\\u2019t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn\\u2019t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn\\u2019t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.\"],[\"I was on a family vacation with my dad, his partner (my stepmother), and other people who represented my siblings. We were seated at a table in a dark room with candlelight although it was daytime outside (I could see daylight coming in through windows in the far corner of the room). In my dream we were drinking red wine and eating bread, waiting for a meal. We were going to a show afterwards. The feeling was tense. Other people came to sit down and the waiter brought a bottle of ouzo, something I had in Greece but have never seen my dad drink. My dad then distributed amounts to each of us around the table but not to me; he shook the bottle towards me but only drops came out. I felt left out even though I didn\\u2019t want the drink really (I don\\u2019t drink a lot in real life). This dream was sad, tense, and confusing. I was hyper-aware of everyone else\\u2019s emotions and felt I needed to be quiet when it came to speaking up for myself.\"],[\"I was on a plane with a team and the plane got shot down. They thought someone was coming to save us but they were shooting at us and we hit the ground running. I picked up a Pisces picture and others. A craft fair and handkerchiefs. Lying but not lying. These were the same handkerchief as the other thing I got. I didn\\u2019t realize it until I pulled it out. The colors were purple and teal and then a design. Other fragments: my first year; Marathon shoes; Makeup bathroom; Cinnamon rolls and blueberry and bordering ahead for next day; Japan shoes off; New shoes running training alternating and two other people; Turning gas off/on way down the path- neighbors and dogs jumping. It looked like my old house growing up. Cleaning out the bathtub, bad vacuums and trash bags, I think I was moving and I sprayed the cleaner on the walls and it was peach and teal and I cleaned while I showered.\"],[\"I was on a rooftop\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room.

Staff kind of found me locked in the hallway with posters, I was staging a protest the following day. I had a million bags and posters and markers and nothing was organized. I felt really flustered. There was a family of 8 that needed help figuring out how to get jobs and who was old enough to work and I couldn\\u2019t figure out what they should do.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room.

We discovered an inaccuracy! It was a big deal- for some reason we were in a ship and there was a lock (waterway) system and somehow this was related to the 1800s. We saw that after the earthquake in the 1800s (which in my dream I think I related to as big as the 1906 in San Francisco) they decided not to fix the underground area because it was all working. We followed the cracks on the floor and then realized there were less cracks on the other side of the room, and somehow this was significant. The imagery was of a big steel ship/boat with dark deep blue paint. Also in part of this dream I was having dinner with my dad by the water\\u2019s edge - by this lock system - and I had just finished eating with my sisters when he came late. I left them to eat together. My sister was going to order a snack. I went to go make myself a big parsley fresh veggie drink somewhere by myself in a hotel room. In my dream I remember thinking, this is a LOT of parsley, but this is really refreshing.\"],[\"I was visiting a friend of mine that was black and all of the other people that were visiting were also black.

My younger sister Sarah was there and I was going to give her a cabbage patch one because she wouldn\\u2019t have had that in her age group growing up younger, but I got chastised for it. Not sure by who. It was dark. So many desserts. I went to get something out of my bag and my cash was soaking wet because something spilled on it and Aidan said I could pay her for my kids and I was like, \\u201cmy kids?\\u201d I guess she had been watching my kids in the dream all weekend while I did this other thing.

I was watching the long green submarines dive down and then I couldn\\u2019t see the people but could hear their tour. It was like we were on a government sponsored tour. Then I was on a boat and there was a black guy driving and suddenly I was alone. He went to go do something and I turned down the radio to hear nature because Sisqo was on, and then a slow jam that sounded familiar and then I was picking out gold earrings. They were huge circles with scenes of people walking paths in nature but none of them matched.

I would look up and call out to people to watch out. I saw things coming my way and was able to deflect them and people were like, \\u201cHow did you do that? That was amazing!\\u201d and I was like, \\u201cI just looked!\\u201d There were these big long boards that would break in half and hit people.

Some workers outside are wearing masks and some not. We drove by an outdoor jewelry store (all stores have moved outside) and I thought I saw people taking things and commented that if I was security I would have to be careful not to assume everyone was guilty. Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He\\u2019s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said \\u201cI knew you would pull that card!\\u201d And I started to read it but couldn\\u2019t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said \\u201clove.\\u201d He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate.

We\\u2019re celebrating someone or something, I\\u2019m not entirely sure. Julie is like, \\u201cHey are you guys coming to my wedding in a day or so?\\u201d Everyone is like, \\u201cSure!\\u201d But then we look it up and it\\u2019s an eight hour drive to her wedding place at her home in a different state. Google maps pops up and I\\u2019m looking at the route I would have to take. Everybody else is like, \\u201cNope, naw, not going to make it.\\u201d But for some reason I feel obligated to go and don\\u2019t understand why. I\\u2019m going. I have no memory of the time in between or the drive, but suddenly I\\u2019m just there at the wedding. It\\u2019s on her property and it\\u2019s very pretty with English style gardens. It\\u2019s a large property and the house is quaint though large. She\\u2019s with mostly family. I\\u2019m watching the ceremony. Then I see Shawna, she did make it to the wedding. She and I are sitting on the toilets. She has a baby in her arms, I think it\\u2019s hers. She finishes and then I finish. I get up and look and am like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s a big shit and I peed. Well done, Rose. Way to eliminate everything you just eliminated.\\u201d We go back out to the wedding. There are people on a dance floor, but there aren\\u2019t many of us from the party there. We\\u2019re all hanging out. The whole time I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m here. I was invited but I don\\u2019t understand why I said yes to drive eight hours because none of these people are good friends.\"],[\"I was with my dad in a restaurant. The restaurant is gloomy looking. There are plush booth-like seats. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m just in that space with him. Then he gets up and leaves. I have his briefcase. I don\\u2019t want to be here. I carry his briefcase and go outside. It is bright daylight. It reminds me of being in a casino where they keep the lights dark so you don\\u2019t know what time it is, so the contrast is weird when I walk outside. I walk down this dirt road. There are fields on either side and barbed wire fences. I think I\\u2019m barefoot and I still have his briefcase. I keep walking. I am going past these houses and notice that some of them are old and falling apart - they are the original houses of the neighborhood. And then there are some new gigantic behemoth houses. The new houses are just huge - all I can see is rooftop after rooftop and I can\\u2019t even see the backend of these houses. Then I get past these houses and there are two separate little farms. The houses are older. It\\u2019s clearly a one-person show. Fruits and vegetables are planted and there are flowers. There\\u2019s also hay for mulching. I\\u2019m walking down the lane, then actually walk through the garden because it\\u2019s so inviting. Then I cross over this boundary - a space of land in between these two farms or houses with gardens - to go to the other little farm. Then I realize the ground underneath me is all hot coals, but my feet are not burning. I\\u2019m wanting to cross and get around, but suddenly I\\u2019m in a labyrinth and I can\\u2019t get out of it. The two owners of the house come out - two older white women. They are trying to help me get out of this little inbetween land that is basically all hot coals. It\\u2019s burning their feet, but not mine. They say, \\u201cWell, you can go that way, but you\\u2019re going to burn yourself.\\u201d But I\\u2019m not getting burned. I don\\u2019t go the way I think I\\u2019m going to go because they say I\\u2019m going to burn myself, but it\\u2019s not hot. At one point I do get out and wave goodbye to these women. As I\\u2019m walking down the lane, these dark hedges appear on either side, maybe to my shoulder height. I still have my dad\\u2019s black briefcase in my hand. Now I think I\\u2019m lost. So I pull an old-fashioned walkie-talkie out of the briefcase and press the button and am like, \\u201cHey dad, can you come pick me up?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cHow are you even contacting me?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI have your briefcase and it has this little walkie-talkie in it. Do you remember? It\\u2019s one of the original cell phones we used to have.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI thought I got rid of that a long time ago. How do you have it? How does it even work?\\u201d I keep saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, but can you come get me?\\u201d He\\u2019s fixating on this thing. He doesn\\u2019t ever come get me. I end up in this house with a friend of mine. I don\\u2019t know her in real life. In the dream, she\\u2019s a kind, effervescent, bubbly, very innocent woman with dark hair. She\\u2019s very round with pale skin. Round cheeks, ample breasts, round butt. She and I are walking together. We\\u2019ve walked across a yard into a house. The guy who is there asks, \\u201cCan I help you?\\u201d because we just show up. She starts to make herself super comfy - gets water and starts to cook. The mother and father who own this house show up and they\\u2019re watching her move around. We\\u2019re all having small talk. It\\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that this woman is the perfect partner for the man in this house - the son of the couple that\\u2019s there. Everything she does, you see his eyes getting bigger and bigger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, she does it like how I do it!\\u201d and \\u201cOh my gosh, I never could figure out how to make bread rise and now she can make the bread rise!\\u201d She\\u2019s not showing off, and she\\u2019s very silly about it. He\\u2019s just suddenly smitten. The parents have this grin on their faces and are laughing and like, \\u201cOh yes! Our son\\u2019s finally going to be married off!\\u201d They come together and you can see this is a little match made in heaven. We go back outside. Then the dream skips a bit and I don\\u2019t have the briefcase or walkie-talkie anymore. We are walking down a lane, but now all the houses are on my left, whereas before they were all on my right. There\\u2019s a big rolling hill - like the hills in Hawaii, covered in green grass. I can see up a ways that there is an outdoor patio with an outdoor fire pit like you\\u2019d see at a ski lodge. It\\u2019s the wedding because a bunch of people have gathered. I don\\u2019t recognize anyone except this couple who used to be my old neighbors in the condo I live in now, Rebecca and Oliver. Rebecca was pregnant while they lived here and now she\\u2019s pregnant again. I see them walking up the hill, but they have 7 or maybe 8 children. She\\u2019s carrying an infant and she\\u2019s very far along with another one. Maybe 9 kids all together. I\\u2019m gobsmacked because that\\u2019s so many kids and they\\u2019re all young - all under 5. Part of me doesn\\u2019t know how that\\u2019s possible. I just look at them and are like, \\u201cAre you guys done having kids?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cNo, we love children.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, if you\\u2019ve got the resources!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at Rebecca and she looks a little haggard, but Oliver is right there with her helping with all the young kids. The dream ends with me wondering why they have so many kids.\"],[\"I was with my dog Pinto at a dog wash and it was strange I was on his level like another dog or his point of view at times. We weren\\u2019t talking with words, just emoting feelings. We were very connected and then we were leaving and I was me again and put him in a bright yellow rain slicker and walked him out. He was prancing and happy and proud. There was a man who I think has been in other dreams, he is kind with brown eyes and he is black and I think from Africa. He reminds me of my friend\\u2019s husband but it\\u2019s not him, just similar appearance and kind energy. I know he\\u2019s been in my dreams before and we aren\\u2019t talking but there\\u2019s an emotional transmission of some kind between his spirit, mine, and my dog.\"],[\"I was with my ex-boyfriend Rory and we were moving in somewhere together and I wasn\\u2019t happy about it. We were getting back together and I was unsure but moving forward. We were trying to buy some things from CostPlus World Market and use coupons. I think it was Redwood City, but it was the future and looked very different. There were all these tall buildings and maybe it was Mountain View. We were planning the shopping trip around a protest that was planned on Friday night. It seemed to be the future and it seemed to be that it was just a part of the regular routine that we were protesting sporadically but it was integrated into our lifestyle.\"],[\"I was with my family and some extended family on my dad\\u2019s side. It was dark and we were going to a big football game. I was nervous about it and I wasn\\u2019t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn\\u2019t like him. I knew that it wasn\\u2019t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design. Everybody was commenting on how fast it was for the game but I was really nervous about going somewhere in public.\"],[\"I was with my friend Emily and she was pouring champagne into glasses and she had some pre-poured in her cupboard! However she drank first and then gave me one but it was a large round cup. I was disappointed it wasn\\u2019t a champagne flute but didn\\u2019t say anything. She said I could stay and watch a movie if I was lonely. I explained that I tried reaching my sisters but that they were busy. In my dream I saw an image of my sister Anne and her family dressed up like fancy Santa and elves and they were doing a family photo shoot and kind of snobbish. Then I went back to my other dream.\"],[\"I was with my friend Heidi (who recently had a baby) at some kind of gym. She was still pregnant and after a workout/class I was putting all of my hand weights away and I had this rolling cart that was probably 5-6 tiers, we all did. Things kept falling off and everything was some shade of purple. She held up a lilac bathing suit and asked whose it was and I was like, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s mine!\\u201d I looked down and I was wearing a black one just like it and it was a size medium, too, so it was mine! We started to chit chat but she had to go. Others were also packing up and we got on a small boat. We were on some kind of island. Later in the dream she was having a baby and I was there and she needed to breathe in to speak and to sing and fill up with breath, but they didn\\u2019t really give us instructions, so we\\u2019re both working on it together. She was only exhaling and I was telling her, \\u201cyou have to inhale to exhale, otherwise you are going to run out of breath and hyperventilate and pass out.\\u201d This is funny because in real life I know it was my yoga teacher training teacher who knows a lot about breathwork and there\\u2019s a lot more than me in all of these types of subjects. In my dream she was really anxious. I think her mom was there in the dream to but I can\\u2019t remember now and then I woke up\"],[\"I was with my friends Emily and Tyler. We were free climbing a rock/ledge that dropped to water. Above are ancient large sculptures carved into the rock of women praying to Mother Earth. There was a whole group of people climbing up and escaping, and people were falling. It was tense and scary, but also beautiful. It wasn\\u2019t day or night.\"],[\"I was with my late husband\\u2019s best friend's wife, Candace. She invited her younger teenage sister over who was wearing a yellow bikini top and tiny black shorts with a robe. There were older guys at the house leering at her and I felt like this could be very inappropriate. In real life I\\u2019ve never met her sister but doubt this would happen. I told her to maybe throw some clothes on and they called me a prude and insecure. I was angry about it when I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my older sister and we were in a huge house, sharing with other other people, mostly women and some kids and it kept flooding! The first time it flooded I didn\\u2019t want her to know so I cleaned it up and realized it was all over even the higher floors. It was dark in the house, too. The second time it flooded she was just out of the shower and I told her it was flooding and she panicked and told me to flip the switches and I couldn\\u2019t find them but I went around spraying the spray she told me to use. It was dark and there were a lot of staircases and rooms and children\\u2019s play stuff but the whole house was empty. There was one staircase without a railing and it went up to a room and I didn\\u2019t want to go up there and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my sister and her soon to be ex husband and we went to watch a parade but we had to stay in a big van and keep changing spots. My cousins were there, actually a lot of my dad\\u2019s side of the family was there. My finger was on the ground. There were cigarette butts on the ground. My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom\\u2019s favorite (she\\u2019s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is \\u201cI\\u2019ll fly away.\\u201d Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene. We were in the ruins of something and I thought we were uptown or in BK but then I realized we were closer to 90th street. I used to live on 89th in real life. I was back on the ground somewhere picking up trash and frantically trying to clean up this backyard dirt area where there were cereal boxes and cigarettes, and shove them into black trash bags. I felt panicked.\"],[\"I was with my sisters and my mom or a woman who represented my mom (who passed away when I was 20). We were like a group of Thelma and Louise type characters running from town to town and we were getting chased by police, there was even a water chase scene on jet skis. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with somebody like a female friend, but I don\\u2019t really remember who. We were walking from somewhere together and there were all these steep hills one after the other. All of a sudden it was snowing and icy and we were really careful going down these really steep hills and talking about how they would gather speed. Then these people came up behind us and they\\u2019re kind of like these hicks. We overheard them saying things like, \\u201ccan you walk Jonas? Look at us.\\u201d I stopped to get these dollar deals on the side of the road and they had these weird covers and I was looking for them everywhere but they only had one pair. There was something that I had to talk to this other friend about before; it was weird. The roadside stand had all kinds of old travel gadgets.\"],[\"I was working in a house for someone. It wasn\\u2019t dark outside but it wasn\\u2019t light either- a place I\\u2019ve never been in real life but in my dream I\\u2019ve been there before. It was old fashioned; it looked Victorian style - lots of lace and a huge heavy dining room table with claw feet. I was hurrying to clean up before the owners came home. There were at least two dogs with me, one small/medium sized and golden brownish and one larger and brown. I think they belonged to the owners of the house but I took care of them. I think a big wave came at the end of the dream with water rushing everywhere and then I woke up (or thought I did) and I thought my Apple Watch was calling someone but when I checked later it wasn\\u2019t. It seemed like it really happened. I thought I heard, \\u201chello, hello\\u201d in a deep female or lighter male voice. I double checked my iPhone and my Apple Watch which I was wearing to monitor my heart rate. I wasn\\u2019t scared but confused.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me, I was somebody else and I was driving to this facility. There was this woman, an astrophysicist, running OT groups and there was this man in the group (I have never seen him before), middle aged longer curly hair, definitely not my type but I leaned into him at one point and he was wearing a sweater and he smelled good. I went to his room and he wasn\\u2019t there overnight so I laid in his bed and then I got up the next morning and I was hiding from everybody. I decided I wanted to drive home, but driving through the desert wasn\\u2019t possible, and I only had one day left there. I went to see the group and they were eating cheesy hashbrowns for breakfast. I finally showed myself but it was embarrassing and really out of character.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me. I was a woman with a family and we had a garden and land and a greenhouse and neighbors. I had a little boy. It was green gray outside. We were watering the garden and there was a sonic BOOM and all of a sudden we could not water or share with our neighbors over the fence. It had stopped the water from being shared. Another part of the dream: Hooded people came. They were shooting at unarmed people in the neighborhood who were just gardening- boom boom! It looked like they were holding hoses but they were guns.\"],[\"I watch as a couple of guys deal with things\\u2026.One guy puts his arms out like he is going to fly\\u2026.he has to wait like this for a bigger process to happen\\u2026.I feel a little sorry for him, just standing like that, waiting\\u2026.A small black plastic tube is part of it\\u2026.And a woman is with them\\u2026.they do not treat her well\\u2026.She sits quietly and waits\\u2026.\"],[\"I watch as a couple of worker guys in a truck finish their task, then drive away\\u2026.I said goodbye to them, but as they drive I see one of them looking for me to wave, but he cannot see me, and they are gone\\u2026.They were here starting their job very early\\u2026.As I go out through a building, I see some of their people taking a nap in a dark, comfortable room\\u2026.Like airline pilots between flights?....I go as quietly as I can through the door, I want to let them get their rest\\u2026.Then, I am sitting with two other people, a man and a woman, and I see three other people sitting together on a property above ours\\u2026.Hmm, that feels like it diminishes our privacy\\u2026.I am in black socks and black sweatpants, which I realize is not a very stylish look outside\\u2026.Still, I am leaning back in my chair, rocking comfortably, pleasantly\\u2026.\"],[\"I watch people holding the hand of a dying one\"],[\"I watched some scary movies like the conjuring and had dreams the same night about the house in the movie. Had dreams about being a Jedi after watching The Clone Wars on Disney Plus.\"],[\"I went swimming in a little pond lake with my friend Sarah and her baby Amy. Amy swam around the Little Rock island in the middle of the pond and I was nervous that she went by herself since she wasn\\u2019t even 2. We got out when the owner of the pond came out and was talking about super boring shit. We ate some lunch and I went to prep for the party. My hair dried cute but I smelled horrible so I took a shower and the water was black running off my body. Aida came over and found a recipe on a piece of paper that fell out of a book. It was for love. She borrowed a bunch of things and went off to make food for someone. I was on the phone with John and talking about a recipe. I opened my bedroom door and there was another door right after it. And then another! And another lol. I was like \\u201cthere are so many doors here\\u201d and then went down stairs and there was a dinner party going on. And he was at the table and reading off to folks whose turn it was to eat and what food to eat. We each ate one at a time. Then after everyone ate, we were playing music, I had some kind of box-shaped rudimentary cello, John had a guitar but it was also box-shaped like homemade, and another person had a box drum.\"],[\"I witnessed an event where a police officer killed a Black person. I was yelling to try and get people\\u2019s attention but no one said or did anything. It was like I wasn\\u2019t there.\"],[\"I woke up from a dream that my husband and I both had the virus and was in the hospital on oxygen and I got a phone call from my ex husband stating my two children had it too and they were dying from it.\"],[\"I woke up in another dream where I was recovering at a house but the house was for sale, so I had to make it presentable. I\\u2019m trying to remember the details on this but I was also watching the interactions between a couple. There was a man and a woman who were together and he was trying to make friends with all of the single women at the party and make plans to see them and his wife was like, \\u201cdude take a break!\\u201d\"],[\"I woke up scared. I was sitting in the systems lobby of the UTP and I was wearing an orange sweater and a little skirt, on one side were CAb and QJo and TAv arrived with whom I was flirting, so I returned home at mid-afternoon and went to sleep, my home was very different from my real home. I was already asleep when my sister GEi started to put something in my mouth and since I was watching a video, she kind of tried to hide the cell phone and then my Mom came saying that one of us had taken drugs, like GEi was trying to put me a pill She said she was going to hit us and I said no and no and no, and she was going to give us a test and there the dream ended.\"],[\"I woke up with such a high fever I could hardly move in my dream. I woke up all wrapped in my blanket!!\"],[\"I wrote a short story all about it\"],[\"I'm fighting in a Civil War. It's Black vs White. Many people on both sides dead. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist supported group. In this dream I am extremely angry that so many Black people are deceived. In the dream I repeatedly say how tragic it is that people on both sides who exercise their constitutional right to peacefully protest are used by evil forces.The fighting is so intense. This isn't my first war either. I feel such anger! then the media /reporters appear I'm shooting them. I am shooting a lot of people...My rifle is out of ammunition and then I wake up. I'm sweating and feel like I've been through a war.\"],[\"I'm often a minor in my dreams, around 16-17 years old, and worried about my parents' opinions and/rules throughout the dream.

I was frantically trying to get in touch with coworkers via email to see if someone could cover, without much luck. The dream isn't specifically about this situation, but these types of anxiety dreams only seem to crop up when something is really bothering me.\"],[\"I've had multiple celebrities in my dreams.\"],[\"I've had several dreams about forgetting about COVID-19 and accidentally going to a crowded place, touching people, or not wearing a mask. Then I remember and panic and I worry about infecting my housemate. In one of these dreams I was at a concert. In another one I was with a group of friends who all kept taking their masks off.\"],[\"I've have dreamed that I was in the movie Inception.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a black sand beach. There are parts where the sand is fine and other parts where the rocks are bigger - maybe fist size. The bigger rocks are white and black mixed together. It\\u2019s steep where the beach goes down into the water. I\\u2019m in a truck with a camper on the top. I\\u2019ve driven the truck to the edge where the beach heads down to the water. There are a bunch of high school classmates and people from other high schools that I grew up with - mostly guys, but a couple girls. I\\u2019m watching them surf and I\\u2019ve got my boogie board to head out to surf with them. I\\u2019m a little freaked out because the waves are big. I go out anyway and catch a few waves. The part that is causing me the most anxiety is that I\\u2019ve parked the truck right on the edge where the beach starts to head down. I need to move the truck and I\\u2019m afraid if I pull it up or back a little bit, it will start sliding down into the water. So, I get in the truck because we are all done surfing and heading to a party. I\\u2019m asking for help. I don\\u2019t want to be the one to try and drive it because I\\u2019m afraid the wheels are going to spin and I\\u2019ll slide down into the water. Then I think I do get the truck out and manage to pull it forward but not without a lot of fear and some help. The scene changes and there\\u2019s a party going on. I don't remember much about the party, except that it\\u2019s all the same people that were there at the beach with me. I feel kind of like the uninvited guest, although I was invited. My own personal feeling about it is that I don\\u2019t really belong there. It\\u2019s a typical high school party with all of us smoking, drinking and dancing. I hated those. There\\u2019s a shift in the dream. I\\u2019m with this super tall dark handsome man - I don\\u2019t know who he is. There\\u2019s a professor and a bunch of other people. Now it feels like a college classroom, but it\\u2019s not an actual classroom. We\\u2019re in a building, and the professor is up in front of me. There is a string of lights - they don\\u2019t look like Christmas lights, the bulbs are much bigger. The professor is showing us the secrets of the universe and how light works and how we harness light and how the vibration slows down into matter. He\\u2019s showing us a very particular property of these lightbulbs that are also plants. This is where it gets a little bit weird. There\\u2019s a string or vine in the corner of the room that is also really open and not exactly inside. There\\u2019s a download of a lot of stuff my brain isn\\u2019t capable of fathoming. In the meantime, the professor is asking for different inanimate objects to illustrate his point. So, there\\u2019s a bed that a bunch of us are laying on or near as we are getting this lesson from the male professor. The tall dark handsome man is lying next to me. He is married - this comes up somewhere in the conversation. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, I guess he\\u2019s off limits now.\\u201d But he is flirting with me like crazy. He asks for a strand of my hair to give the professor so the professor can show us whatever he\\u2019s going to show us. It was a flirty move for the guy to grab a strand of my hair and this flirtation is happening, even though he made sure to tell me he was married. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really care about that if you don\\u2019t care and your partner\\u2019s alright with it.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t know where this is going and it\\u2019s interesting that we\\u2019re lying on a bed. Then the scene shifts again. I\\u2019m in a gym. There are pull up bars - like the rack in a CrossFit gym. There\\u2019s a coach. We\\u2019re doing an endurance test of how strong we all are and how long we can do pull ups with correct form - our form has to be super solid. He\\u2019s giving us a really specific circuit - five strict pull ups, five butterfly pull ups, then a hang in the pull up position to hold for five seconds - and do as many sets of that as possible. I\\u2019m getting really frustrated with the bars they have because there\\u2019s not enough room to do the butterfly pull ups. I keep trying but keep hitting my back on the rig behind me. I\\u2019m finding this entire exercise incredibly frustrating. We\\u2019re trying to get through ten sets of this 5 + 5 + 5. I keep moving to different places on the rig to find a place where I can do the butterfly pull ups correctly. In the meantime, I\\u2019m watching all these dudes whip out all these reps. I\\u2019m so annoyed and thinking, \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s just because men are naturally stronger than women in the upper body and I haven\\u2019t had a chance to workout or train at all and I\\u2019m doing this from a disadvantaged place.\\u201d The whole feel of this is really frustrating. Then the scene changes again. I\\u2019m with classmates at a dance party. We\\u2019re dancing on one of the many lawns of our high school - there are lots of open fields where we played sports or parked cars or hung out. It\\u2019s freestyle dancing and we\\u2019re having a good time dancing together. There\\u2019s a DJ. One of the girls - I don\\u2019t really recognize her in the dream - is dancing, but I can tell she\\u2019s not super comfortable. So there\\u2019s some sort of interlude. She comes back and we\\u2019re all dancing again. This time she has 8 backup dancers and she\\u2019s clearly choreographed and rehearsed a dance to do. All of us are like, \\u201cWhat are you doing? This is a dance for fun. You don\\u2019t need backup dancers to make you look better.\\u201d We\\u2019re laughing at her. She\\u2019s clearly put a lot of work into this dance. The backup dancers are all very serious with what they\\u2019re doing. All of us are like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve missed the point. The point is just to let your body move and dance and have fun.\\u201d It seems very odd in the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a conference. I look across the way and see a yoga studio. The studio is struggling to keep its doors open. I see what looks to be an image of Ana Forrest, an international yoga teacher. She\\u2019s doing padangusthasana. As I look, I realize, it\\u2019s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it\\u2019s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it\\u2019s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don\\u2019t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she\\u2019s participating in to raise funds for the school. She\\u2019s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn\\u2019t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a convention. There are multiple themes to this convention - things are being demoed and sold, but it\\u2019s also a CrossFit convention because every person is jacked and totally yoked, including the women. I think, \\u201cEh, I used to look like that and I don\\u2019t anymore. I\\u2019m glad I don't.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a judgment against them, though. I\\u2019m just glad I\\u2019m not in the CrossFit mindset. I\\u2019m here with some people - a woman who is a little shorter than me with longer brown hair. Her vibe is the vibe of my ex and I\\u2019m not liking her. She seems to be doing stuff that makes no sense. She buys a charcoal grill that is red, brand new and shiny and clean. I turn to her and say, \\u201cWe actually have a charcoal grill at home that looks exactly like that, but it\\u2019s black. Why are you buying a new one?\\u201d She\\u2019s not computing that we don\\u2019t need another one. She\\u2019s just in it for the thrill of buying, I think. I just don\\u2019t understand why she can\\u2019t understand that we don\\u2019t need another one. Then, the other person I\\u2019m with is a man. He\\u2019s buying a truck - a huge black truck. Part of me is like, \\u201cCan you even afford that truck? I think you actually owe me money, so how are you paying for that truck?\\u201d At one point we try these demo treadmills. An instructor is walking people through a HIT workout - high intensity training. There are a bunch of CrossFitters. He says, \\u201cEveryone has to keep their treadmill at six.\\u201d I\\u2019m struggling to keep it at six and last for 15 or 30 seconds. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t for me.\\u201d This is not my norm - normally I would just push until I won. I just didn\\u2019t. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, you all go ahead do this. I\\u2019m not interested.\\u201c I get off the treadmill. Then I wonder where my kids are. This couple I was with reminds me of my ex and maybe his girlfriend. I\\u2019m really concerned. He was supposed to be watching them and says, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re off with friends.\\u201d I have no idea who my daughter is with and I never see her in the dream, but I have this worry for her because I don't know where she is. Then I go looking for my son and wander out of the convention center. There\\u2019s a pool and a grassy area. I see a bunch of other moms sitting in folding chairs. I\\u2019m asking if they\\u2019ve seen my son. One says, \\u201cOh yea, he\\u2019s with my kid.\\u201d These moms have their sons and they\\u2019re with this other mom who pulls up in this huge black suburban. My son is in the backseat with a bunch of other boys. The mom is in the front. I say, \\u201cHi, who are you? I don\\u2019t know you at all.\\u201d She introduces herself and says that they\\u2019ve had my son at their house before. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking them all to the waterpark or the trampoline place.\\u201d Part of me is like, \\u201cWhy are you trusting this person you\\u2019ve never met? There\\u2019s a gaggle of boys in the back with two coughing because they\\u2019re so sick.\\u201d My son is like, \\u201cMom I want to go!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo way! Get out of that car.\\u201d Then the other part of me is like, \\u201cWell, I guess I have her phone number and I can trust her. All the other moms trust her with their kids. She seems legit, okay let him go.\\u201d I close the door and let them drive off and then am like, \\u201cOh god, I shouldn\\u2019t have let him go.\\u201d There\\u2019s a sinking feeling in my chest that does not feel good. I\\u2019m really concerned. I turn around and walk back towards the moms. They\\u2019re trying to tell me that it\\u2019s going to be fine. I\\u2019m just not having it. I\\u2019m starting to panic like, bring me back my son and where is my daughter. I\\u2019m wondering why my ex is letting them go with people he doesn\\u2019t even know. I am feeling upset by the whole thing. I\\u2019m really wanting the kids to come back and to know where they are.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a crowded dinner party. We haven\\u2019t sat down to eat yet. We\\u2019re all going in and out of the kitchen putting together a bunch of different salads and setting the table. They\\u2019re mostly young adults in their twenties, just out of college it seems. I get a phone call from a landline. It\\u2019s Ted. I can hardly hear him because of all the activity in the kitchen and people with their pots and pans and multiple conversations. I can hear the gist of it. He\\u2019s having a hard time. I suggest he come in for some care. He makes a comment that is the closest thing to being overt about his attraction to me that I\\u2019ve ever heard. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWill it be okay for you to treat someone who\\u2019s hitting on you?\\u201d I'm thinking about all the rules and regulations and if this would be okay because I would like to see him. The conversations in the kitchen get louder and someone asks me to set the table so I have to go. There\\u2019s a shift in the dream. There\\u2019s a young couple in a courtyard. Tables are set up for an event. The couple is wandering through. They\\u2019ve met each other here and are wanting to extend the night. They\\u2019re walking around and I\\u2019m watching them. They\\u2019re falling in love as the day and evening go by. Their families arrive and for some reason they\\u2019re not supposed to be together. The families overlook it for now. The dream goes by and they\\u2019re spending more time together. He\\u2019s painting her and writing about her. His family forbids them from seeing each other. But she\\u2019s moved in with him. She\\u2019s packing to go and she shows him where she has stored papers and journals beside his bed. She says, \\u201cIf you miss me and want to know me better, look through these papers.\\u201d There are empty plastic organizing folders and receipt folders filled with receipts from 2007 or 2017. She points out the years and says, \\u201cIf you want to know who I was back then, you can look at these.\\u201d She\\u2019s being transparent about her past. She has to leave and she does. They make an arrangement to meet at a sporting goods store in the future. She walks in and there are people taking a physical therapy exercise class at the back of the store and there are different exercise stations throughout the store. People are trying out the equipment and taking class. She wanders to the back and meets people and thinks she could help them more at her office. But she realizes they only have to pay $5 a class here and they are getting some help here. She sees him and they have to pretend they haven\\u2019t. She wanders to the front of the store where there are two television screens set up showing an exercise dance class. It\\u2019s an interesting setup because one television shows the front of the teacher and the other shows the back of the teacher, so it\\u2019s easier to follow along. He sees her dancing and walks over to sit near her and set up his art exhibit. Then his mom comes in and she\\u2019s dressed primly. She\\u2019s paging through the book the couple had made together - the woman has written the words and he\\u2019s drawn the pictures. A lot of the pictures are of the young woman. The mom is flipping through the book. There are pictures of the mom, too. She\\u2019s pretending to not be impressed but it is truly a fabulous piece of art. She\\u2019s there to lead a group of young girls in a dance performance. The girls are dressed in overcoats and hats with flowers. She\\u2019s so stern. At the end of the performance, instead of congratulating them on their performance, she coldly walks away.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a dinner party of sorts - it feels like one of those social gatherings like an auction where they raise money for a cause. I\\u2019m sitting at a long table and there\\u2019s a Latino man to my left who is paying me quite a lot of attention, but my attention is focused on another group of people who are not sitting at a table - they are standing up and gathered in a crowd and they\\u2019re huddled somewhat closely together. Some of them are dressed as servers who are working this banquet dinner. Some of them are dressed as guests. The sense I\\u2019m getting is that they have something up their sleeve. They\\u2019re planning to do something and there\\u2019s definitely magic involved. I keep seeing little flashes or vignettes of little scenes where something is a little out of place and the thing that\\u2019s out of place has a red color and everything else in the background is its normal color. I\\u2019m not quite understanding everything I\\u2019m seeing, but I know that each of these little vignettes I see, one thing is going to trigger the next thing and it will be a sequence of events that creates this magic. I don\\u2019t even know what it is - it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s supposed to impact the way this auction dinner is going. This is taking up quite a bit of my attention until the Latino man on my left who has dark short cropped black hair, dark skin and a 5 o\\u2019clock shadow where I can see he has shaved but it\\u2019s not smoothe...He\\u2019s a little older than I am and he has leaned over to get my attention. He\\u2019s leaning over my left shoulder and it feels like his upper body is almost in my lap, but he\\u2019s still being very respectful, it\\u2019s not a pushy way, he just really is trying to get my attention. He says that he will protect me and love me no matter what, which I find a little unnerving because I don\\u2019t know who he is. This scene ends and it cuts away to me driving a car. I\\u2019m driving away from the dinner. I think it\\u2019s the next day because it\\u2019s light out and this was definitely a dinner happening in the evening. I\\u2019m driving to an errand of some sort and I can see that it\\u2019s sunny and it looks like I\\u2019m going the regular path I take to drive my kids to tennis. I\\u2019m on the phone with a girlfriend and I\\u2019m relating this story to her and I\\u2019m relating the behavior of this Latino man who, now that it\\u2019s the next day I feel like he was a kind of wizard of some sort or at least he had great magical power or he had the ability to at least take me out of whatever was going on. So I\\u2019m relating this story of my friend and I\\u2019m asking her what she thinks of it. She\\u2019s telling me that yes it was somewhat strange behavior but I could actually trust this man and I remember thinking, well, trust him or not, I don\\u2019t know why he said he was going to love me. There was no chemical attraction there at all. I just felt baffled by his behavior. But I start to feel strange talking about this on the phone the next day and I know that there is some sort of connection happening and it feels like there\\u2019s an alchemical process happening in my body as I describe it to my friend. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a lake cottage with my son. We are standing on the edge of the lake. We see a mama and baby swan, a rodent/marsupial mama and baby, and another mama and baby animal. He points out a small black bat struggling in the water. We are watching it as it splashes. He\\u2019s asking me about it: \\u201cIs that a bird, mama?\\u201d I tell him it\\u2019s a bat. I\\u2019m concerned it could have rabies. Other people and kids come by. They are climbing around the rocks. A woman holds my son and then gives him back to me saying he pooped in his diaper. I\\u2019m surprised because he\\u2019s potty trained. But I do see that her dress is soiled and so is his diaper. I take him away to change even though he wants to stay and play. We return to the cottage. I see Trina, a friend and former boss. She says, \\u201cOh, I need you to run an errand for me. I need you to carry my pet wombat to my other house.\\u201d I take this wombat with me on the trip and it is climbing all over me. It\\u2019s quite cuddly, cute and soft, like a baby. I arrive at her other house and see a lot of people. They are soaking in hot tubs by the lake. There isn\\u2019t a spot for me here. Then Trina\\u2019s husband wants to show me something. It\\u2019s a restaurant or storefront under construction. He wants my opinion about the flooring and decor.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party, it\\u2019s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I\\u2019m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m feeling like, \\u201cUh, I don\\u2019t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn\\u2019t feel super good.\\u201d Fear of judgment and all that. I\\u2019m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we\\u2019re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll be back.\\u201d I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019ve never seen before, but it's a house that\\u2019s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I\\u2019m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I\\u2019m at her house, which I don\\u2019t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They\\u2019re talking to me about planning how they\\u2019re going to remodel parts of their house and how it\\u2019s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they\\u2019re going to earn it. I\\u2019m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he\\u2019s one of those ages). They\\u2019re showing me how they\\u2019re going to do it. They\\u2019re really, really friendly - it\\u2019s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there\\u2019s different ways. I\\u2019m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, \\u201cWell, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.\\u201d So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It\\u2019s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.\\u201d Then my friend is like, \\u201cWell I need you to come and do this thing with me.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I\\u2019m feeling torn because I don\\u2019t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there\\u2019s all these crappy t-shirts like you\\u2019d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They\\u2019re on one of those round racks and I\\u2019m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re doing all these things, come do this with me.\\u201d A second friend from the party comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGuess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.\\u201d She\\u2019s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that\\u2019s where I worked. It\\u2019s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. It\\u2019s at a bar/restaurant with wood picnic tables, floors, walls and ceilings. My husband is in a bad mood and we aren\\u2019t talking. My son is there along with other kids. There\\u2019s a pool in here. I get in the water and am first just hanging out, quite morose. Now everyone is hanging out under the water. Some are drinking, some are talking and some are sitting quietly by themselves. I start propelling myself through the water with my arms. I feel so free and strong and good in my body, propelling myself from side to side, from one end of the pool to the other. I observe people talking and flirting and some high on drugs. I see my husband just lying there on his stomach with a glass of water and a plastic cup of beer. He\\u2019s not wanting to talk to me or look at me. I lie next to him on the bottom of the pool. Neither of us speak and I can tell he\\u2019s still in a mood. After a while I get up. He gets up and adjusts a necklace on a man\\u2019s neck. I wonder what that\\u2019s about. I look around and don\\u2019t see my son. I don\\u2019t see any children. The kids are all together in another room. I look through the door and see Maxine bouncing a blond boy on her knee. At first I think it\\u2019s my son, but he\\u2019s too young and his hair is a bit longer. I look deeper into the room and see my son at the far end sitting at a desk and reading a book on a screen device like an iPad. Maxine says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019ll be done in a little bit. We only do a few minutes of screen time.\\u201d I\\u2019m not pleased because we don\\u2019t do screen time at all. I also see a plastic magic school bus toy. On the plastic window are words. The second line says, \\u201cA fucking ride.\\u201d The third line says to choose your form of payment: \\u201cboys, another and aloha.\\u201d I\\u2019m peeved that there are different fees for boys and girls. The teacher tries to convince me that it\\u2019s good thing because the kids can choose whatever fee they want and even have the girls pay more.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a reform school for little children. Somehow my son is safe, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s because he\\u2019s too young or too old. My husband and I have rented a massage room upstairs and we\\u2019re trying to get out of the lease because it feels sinister. While I\\u2019m there, the reformers come. They are young men, probably in their twenties. They\\u2019ve been reformed themselves and have grown up in this system. They\\u2019re there to separate out the children and choose the ones who will be reformed. They separate them into red groups and orange groups. I think that it would be best for them to choose the ones who are already complacent and will go along with everything. But I notice that the young men are ones that I recognize from earlier in my life - I saw them at Esalen and they were really carefree spirits. So the children that they are not the complacent quiet well behaved ones, but of course the ones that are the most wild, free and expressive - the ones that have a sense of themselves from the very beginning, kind of like my son... One of those colors will be the group that will be reformed this time around. All of the little ones that will be taken away are on a bus and my husband is on the bus. He wants to take a ride down the hill to the gate. He encourages me and our son to get on the bus, too. I don\\u2019t feel great about it, but I get on the bus. The headmistress steps onto the bus, too. I get a very bad feeling. The bus starts going and I want to get out. I demand that they stop the bus and let me out. I know that I can\\u2019t save the children that have already been chosen but I need to get out for myself and my son. They won\\u2019t stop the bus. So I push my way to the front doors of the bus and push the doors open. I\\u2019m holding my son and I look down at the ground, jump out and tumble to the ground. My son and I are safe. I don\\u2019t know what will happen to my husband, but I have a feeling he\\u2019ll be fine.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a social gathering with my husband and he\\u2019s really upset with me. He\\u2019s flirting with another woman. She\\u2019s like a Barbie doll - really skinny with bleach blonde hair. She\\u2019s wearing a pink gown, her hair is done just right, her makeup is done just right. She\\u2019s this archetype of a \\u201cperfect\\u201d woman advertised in magazines. He\\u2019s being a gentleman - pulling her chair out, pouring wine into her glass, and being really attentive to all her needs. She\\u2019s responding to him. I\\u2019m aware that she\\u2019s intentionally being mean to me in showing her feelings towards my husband. I get livid. This is not unusual in my dreams. I\\u2019m punching and kicking and making a huge display. Then I have to retire to another room and rest for the night. Everybody has to lie down on floors and go to sleep. Then the next part of the dream, there\\u2019s an assembly of people sitting in chairs like in a college auditorium. There\\u2019s been a rebellion. Every year we base our family celebration (something like Thanksgiving) on multidimensional geometry. But this year, there\\u2019s a rebellion. This big guy who looks like he used to play football but is now heavy from beer and nachos stands up and draws a single dimension triangle with squiggles around it. He says we\\u2019re doing it this way this year. So he makes it really flat and simple. There are grumbles throughout - some people are really upset but can\\u2019t do anything about it, others are more supportive and happy it will be easier for them to understand. I am forced to join this new celebration. Everyone around me is heavy - they drink a lot of beer and eat a lot of processed food - they\\u2019re like your typical American. They\\u2019re making the feast. I am participating in making the feast. They give me a sip of this walnut liquor and I find it unusual that they have a taste for this liquor because it seems quite refined. Then somebody is talking about the walnut flooring they were able to purchase for their new home because somebody else maybe their girlfriend lent them $500 to help with their school, so they had this extra money to put towards the new floors in their home. Then I look out the window and there\\u2019s a spaceship flying by, so we must be really high in the sky. I look in the window of this new spaceship and it has a table with seating for four and a little loveseat. It seems to be an advertisement for this new kind of meeting room/home that flies through the sky. It\\u2019s futuristic.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at an airport. I\\u2019m sitting at a table playing a card or domino game with my grandmother and Ted. There is definitely a strong desire and attraction between Ted and me. We want to find a place and time after the game to be together. My grandmother is watching without judgment. She knows. There\\u2019s absolutely no judgment from her, but for me I feel a combination of comfort with her and a strong charge of desire and comfort in playing with him, especially when our hands occasionally touch. I have a wallet. I need to pay for something - my portion of a rent or dues as part of a big group. I take my wallet out to pay. Somehow my husband now has my wallet and takes care of the payment for me. My grandmother goes on to catch her plane. Ted and I walk together through a crowd, but not wanting to attract any attention because he is well respected in this group as am I - we are both known. Now I\\u2019m looking for a new carry-on suitcase. There are stores all over. I have an argument with my husband about which one to get and it\\u2019s so frustrating. I see a store with some beautiful floral suitcases on the loft. I\\u2019m told that this shopkeeper knows exactly what I need. I consult with her and choose one. I panic when I try to pay and can\\u2019t find my wallet. Ted goes to look for it. Then I remember that my husband has it. He scoffs at me and says the wallet is in the jacket, or at least that\\u2019s where he put it and last saw it. I\\u2019m frustrated because I don\\u2019t trust that he put it in the jacket in a secure way. I\\u2019m also concerned he just left it somewhere. Then I come upon a huge underground room - it\\u2019s like an underground sea with big pillars holding up the roof. It\\u2019s dark. I see wading in the shallow water, a figure like Merlin in a cape and holding a staff. I wade into the water to see him. I\\u2019m still thinking of and desiring Ted. I look up and see people coming across the bridge. They are carrying my coat. They give the coat to me. I feel through it and cannot find my wallet. It\\u2019s the wrong coat and my wallet is not there. I\\u2019m shaking it and feeling all over. People walk into the water then walk out. I\\u2019m not sure if they have my highest interest in mind. They are communicating with the magician. I leave. I do find the correct jacket with the wallet in the pocket.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at my childhood home. It really does look like my childhood home. The backyard is like what I\\u2019m used to seeing. The house is just kind of like I know it, some of the pieces are the same. In the backyard now there is a lanai that goes all the way out and it\\u2019s glassed in with doors that have eight little square window panes. It looks like a greenhouse or sunporch. It also has an English period feel to it. It\\u2019s very bright. The sunroom is painted white. There\\u2019s silver everywhere - silver serving platters and whatnot. We\\u2019re not dressed fancy or anything; we\\u2019re in Hawaii and dressed comfortably. I see a plate of bacon on the porch. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes! Bacon!\\u201d I go to eat it and my mom is like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s from so and so, she brought it over. She\\u2019s trying it out to see if it\\u2019s the kind we like or want.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s interesting and wonder why they would be doing that. I know sometimes bacon is coated in flour and now I\\u2019m wary of trying it because I know I\\u2019m allergic. Then my brothers are showing up and they\\u2019re demolishing the bacon. When I look out at the backyard, I can see the stream and the cliff wall on the far side - I\\u2019ve had this in other dreams before. I\\u2019ve dreamt this landscape in dreams but it doesn\\u2019t actually match what my backyard looks like in real life. I can usually see to the other side of the stream a hill which I could go up and over. But this time is the cliff face on the far side and the water. There\\u2019s some sort of activity happening. There are a bunch of nice lawn chairs like you\\u2019d have for an event. They\\u2019re all set up on the lawn. I am looking through a pair of binoculars. My brothers are sitting in some of the chairs and my binoculars are rating them. My brothers are suddenly younger in age. The binoculars are like, \\u201cThis one is single and he plays sports, he\\u2019s a forward.\\u201d I look at the next one and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis one is too young for consideration.\\u201d Then I look at another one and the binoculars say something rude like, \\u201cNot cute.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow fuck you rude binoculars.\\u201d They don\\u2019t actually say things; they\\u2019re printing words at the bottom of my vision. It\\u2019s so strange and I don\\u2019t know why my brothers are being rated. There are two other guys. I don\\u2019t recognize them, but they\\u2019re youngish and fit within my brothers\\u2019 ages. They have what looks like soccer shin pads that I\\u2019ve made for them. They need them but I don\\u2019t know why. I\\u2019m sewing the shin pads into the box and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this because they\\u2019re going to need them eventually. I\\u2019m very meticulous, one tiny stitch at a time, sewing them into a cardboard box and plastic frame. All of a sudden I realize they\\u2019re going to need to wear these so why am I doing this because they won\\u2019t be able to get them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere are your shin pads. You\\u2019ll need them when you need them.\\u201d One of them asks me how to make the shin pads tight on their legs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s velcro, you just tighten it.\\u201d One of them is like, \\u201cNo, you might have to sew them onto me.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cI could sew through your skin but that would be weird.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, that might happen.\\u201d I\\u2019m confused internally. Part of me thinks that makes total sense and I might need to sew them onto their skin and it\\u2019s like a right of passage and that\\u2019s how I know they\\u2019re warriors. But the other part of my brain is like, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t sew skin.\\u201d Then the dream changes a little bit. I decide to go to the pool. I did not grow up with a pool so this is definitely out of my regular childhood home reality. I wade into the pool. It\\u2019s a huge rectangular pool, enclosed with glass windows on one side and some light coming in. There are double doors that look like the same doors on the sunporch. It\\u2019s like a boat ramp that you walk down and it slowly gets deeper and deeper. So I\\u2019m in the pool and at the far end where there is less light and a lot darker, there\\u2019s a room off to the left. Part of the room is underwater. Somebody opens the doors to this room. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I know that they\\u2019re not supposed to open those doors. Sure enough, this creature comes out of those doors. I\\u2019m scared. I don\\u2019t recall what the creature looks like. It\\u2019s coming into the main pool. I have swum out to where I can\\u2019t touch and now I\\u2019m swimming back to where I can get out of the water. I remember tentacles so maybe it was part octopus, but I\\u2019m not sure.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at the beach with Trina and Craig. When I first arrive, they're in the ocean taking surf lessons. It\\u2019s quite rough, choppy water, so not ideal surf conditions. They get back to the shore and talk about their time out in the water. They invite us out into the water with them. They\\u2019ve hired a boat. We go together. They didn\\u2019t set up surf lessons for us, though. The boat is just taking us out through a complex series of docks and things, not open ocean. We\\u2019re going to a floating hotel and through the hotel. A door opens. There\\u2019s a smaller boat with a guy in a wheelchair that goes ahead of our larger boat. He opens the doors for us to pass through. Then we get to open water but it\\u2019s not surfable. They leave us there to find our way back or get settled into a room.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at the bottom of a pool. I feel my belly soft on the undulating seaweed. Then I\\u2019m standing looking up and I can easily breathe with my arms uplifted.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I\\u2019m in the back - the receiving room. There\\u2019s tons of product to put out, but it\\u2019s time to close and go home. So we\\u2019re all working as quick as we can. My coworkers along with the manager I usually close with at night are there. My manager is saying, \\u201cOkay, finish this cart, but leave the rest. It\\u2019s time to get out. We need to be done.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what she says, so I gather up my stuff and go out. But then she's like, \\u201cOh no, we\\u2019re not leaving out. We have to put all this away.\\u201d There are a bunch of brand new carts out in this open space in the store. They have orange handles and our carts have green handles, so I\\u2019m looking at these orange handles and one of my other coworkers who is also a manager says, \\u201cHey, can you clean that one cart right there?\\u201d It has all this sticky stuff on it - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s honey or maple syrup or what. I\\u2019m looking at it and am like, \\u201cOh my god, this is going to take forever to clean. I just want to go home.\\u201d But they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t go home until this stuff is put away or cleaned up.\\u201d So, I\\u2019m scrubbing this and I\\u2019m pretty cranky about it. I get it clean. Then I realize later that if I had just stuck the cart in the freezer, that stuff would have frozen and I could have just flaked it off. But I get it cleaned and I roll it to the back. Now everybody is ready to go, but they\\u2019re waiting on me because it took me forever to clean that cart. I sit down because I need to change my shoes and take off my apron. They\\u2019re all in the room where we clock out. I\\u2019m still in the break room, trying to hurry. Suddenly, this pole appears in the receiving room in the back. The coworker who told me to clean all the sticky stuff off the cart is like, \\u201cOh, can you show me some pole stuff? I want to see what it looks like.\\u201d So, I get on there and I do some moves. I\\u2019m totally impressed with myself because I didn\\u2019t know I could do all these moves and they look good. She\\u2019s totally impressed. But I still have this in the back of my mind that I need to hurry up and get my stuff and go. But she\\u2019s like, \\u201cShow me another one.\\u201d So I go to do the same moves but on the other side - my drunk side. I\\u2019m not as good on the drunk side. I don\\u2019t hang onto the pole and I\\u2019m falling off. I feel rushed anyway. So I mess it up. I don't fall off the pole, but I get off real quick. She leaves. I go to gather my stuff again because I still don\\u2019t have everything because I was on the pole. I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes. I get my shoes on. In my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you putting these heels on? You\\u2019re going to have to get in the car and drive. It\\u2019s hard to drive in heels. You should just leave your flats on.\\u201d I get my bag. It\\u2019s one of those sports bags that have shoes and my lunch and my earrings - I haven\\u2019t put my earrings back on. I go to leave and I\\u2019m rushed because everybody is waiting on me. We walk out the back door. I\\u2019m no longer in town. As soon as I go out the back door, I\\u2019m somewhere else. I\\u2019m not entirely sure where I am. There\\u2019s a train like the sugarcane train that\\u2019s in Maui that is open on all sides. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I gotta catch this train.\\u201d I get on the train. I am still messing with my shoes and I don\\u2019t get off at my stop. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, well it\\u2019s okay, I\\u2019ll keep riding the train.\\u201d I think maybe I\\u2019ll walk home. I don\\u2019t know why I decide to stay on the train instead of getting off at my stop. Now the train goes and it\\u2019s long past any of my stops. We\\u2019re passing a ton of ocean - there\\u2019s this large expanse of ocean on my right side. The train is on land still, but all of this ocean passes and suddenly I\\u2019m in Lahaina, on Maui. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m really screwed now. There\\u2019s no way for me to get home.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left my phone at work - at the grocery store. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well maybe i can just get off at this stop and I\\u2019ll walk home.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019m going to walk home. It\\u2019s so far for me to get home. So I go to get off the train at this one stop as I hear the conductor say, \\u201cAnybody for this street?\\u201d The street names are all in Hawaiian. It looks like we\\u2019re on Front Street in Lahaina, at least parts of it look like what I remember Front STreet looking like. So I go to get off and then I realize, \\u201cNope, I can\\u2019t.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left that sports travel duffel bag on the train, too. So, the train goes into town and then it starts to reverse a little bit and backs up for a couple of stops. I get off at the stop closest to home, except it\\u2019s still miles and miles away. I get off and then I realize I can\\u2019t get off and this is silly of me. There\\u2019s no way I can get anywhere and I left my bag on the train. So I get back on and go to get my bag. But now I don\\u2019t know what to do because the train is going to go forward again. I\\u2019m just going to be further away from home than I want to be. But if I get off here, there\\u2019s no one for me to call to get me home and I don\\u2019t have my phone with me. I think, \\u201cWell, my dad lives in Lahaina.\\u201d But even then, I can\\u2019t call him and I don\\u2019t want to be with or near him anyway.\"],[\"I\\u2019m bleeding and it\\u2019s not my time to bleed.\"],[\"I\\u2019m dreaming that I was over a river, maybe standing on a bridge, and watching children and their teacher swim across. They were working on some kind of project and swimming back and forth across the river. The big part of the dream that stands out is that I was holding a baby and it was someone else\\u2019s baby. They handed the baby to me and said, \\u201cFeed it.\\u201d I looked at them confused because it wasn\\u2019t my baby and I had no milk to feed it. Whoever handed it to me, the baby\\u2019s mother, did something to me so my breasts were lactating. I remember my breasts hurting. I could feel the feeling of let-down but also the soreness of when you\\u2019ve just started breastfeeding or your baby has nursed a little too hard and your nipples are sensitive. I could feel that and the pressure of being engorged. I couldn\\u2019t feed the baby fast enough. I kept trying. The baby had a plastic face shield that everyone is wearing these days and it couldn\\u2019t get to the milk. I tried to lift the face shield up so it could latch on, but the baby just couldn\\u2019t get latched on in the right way. I remember feeling frustrated but also scared for the baby because I couldn\\u2019t feed it and wasn\\u2019t able to give it what it needed. I also remember the pain of being engorged and not being able to nurse.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger\\u2019s seat. We\\u2019re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I\\u2019m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex\\u2019s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It\\u2019s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she\\u2019s there, but I\\u2019m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There\\u2019s only one white man in the entire house. It\\u2019s so interesting. I\\u2019m noticing all of this. They\\u2019re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There\\u2019s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the \\u201cI feel\\u201d and \\u201cI experience\\u201d and \\u201cWhen this happened, it made me feel like this\\u201d language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It\\u2019s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, \\u201cOh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.\\u201d I start to get this nagging feeling that it\\u2019s time for us to continue on our road trip. I\\u2019ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it\\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. I\\u2019m cleaning up my space. It\\u2019s like an Airbnb, so I\\u2019m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she\\u2019s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I\\u2019m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I\\u2019m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I\\u2019m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it\\u2019s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don\\u2019t, and I change my clothes. I\\u2019m kind of damp. I don\\u2019t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren\\u2019t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.\"],[\"I\\u2019m giving a session to Gemma outside in a courtyard. There\\u2019s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He\\u2019s good friends with Gemma, maybe they\\u2019re lovers. I\\u2019m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she\\u2019s going to the dinner later. I\\u2019m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, \\u201cThank you, that was really great.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting feedback but there isn\\u2019t time. Some other things happen and it\\u2019s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can\\u2019t come in because he\\u2019s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It\\u2019s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I\\u2019m not quite sure what they are because they\\u2019ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn\\u2019t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn\\u2019t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they\\u2019re much larger than me. I\\u2019m either really far away or I\\u2019ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I\\u2019m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It\\u2019s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It\\u2019s an ornate room with wood floors. There\\u2019s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they\\u2019re going to trap me, I\\u2019ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month\\u2019s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I\\u2019m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it\\u2019s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn\\u2019t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji\\u2019s ashram comes in and she\\u2019s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I\\u2019m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn\\u2019t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019ve been banished and will never be able to return. You\\u2019re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.\\u201d She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.\\u201d She laughs. I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don\\u2019t realize that I\\u2019m the one who took the entire community\\u2019s water.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to a theatre show with my mom, sister and two other women. There\\u2019s five of us. We are walking down the steps to the seats. I\\u2019m wearing a silk blue gown and a fur stole. I\\u2019m trying to wrap it around my neck in an elegant way, but look quite awkward. We thought we were early, but as we try to find our seats, we have trouble finding five in a row. There are some openings for four seats, but not five. The chairs are plush red velvet. We\\u2019re walking up the aisle looking for a spot. People are saving empty seats with clothing and other items. We have to walk pretty far away from the stage to find a row, but eventually do. We file in and I take note of the people around us. After the show, which I don\\u2019t recall, we go out to a balcony. A man joins me. He is a little creepy. He puts headphones on me. He also has a set. He plays a short meditation on his iphone. I\\u2019m supposed to drop in and have a consciousness altering experience. But I\\u2019m worried about what his ulterior motive might be. Then some light dance music comes on. I\\u2019m still somewhat listening but others come out on the deck and I\\u2019m wanting to interact with them. A man talks to the creepy guy about his coaching program. I somehow see a digital display of this program. It\\u2019s based on the life, death and rebirth of Jesus. I comment on transformation as a moment of life and how it relates to Jesus\\u2019 death on the cross. I\\u2019m quite intrigued by the life design coaching program and want to know more. A tidal wave is coming, but people are in the ocean, on the beach, and standing on the balcony nearby watching unconcerned. We\\u2019re trying to warn them so they survive. I climb up onto a wooden lifeguard stand with some other people. We are looking out at a crowd. There is some kind of trial or judgement happening. They pass a microphone up to us on the stand. The creepy man who is maybe not so creepy anymore is up on the stand. He hides his face so they won\\u2019t recognize him as he speaks in favor of the person being judged. I have to get away. I know that Mary is somewhere in the crowd and she needs to get away, too.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to get two cats that I had dropped off. But when we get them, they\\u2019re adolescent tigers. They\\u2019re nuzzling each other. We\\u2019re petting them and they\\u2019re playful. I\\u2019m surprised that they\\u2019re tigers now. Then I see our old dog who we rehomed years ago because he needed a different situation, but then he ended up dying. He\\u2019s old and blind and bleeding. I grab him to rehabilitate him. He looks very sad.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I do not know. We\\u2019re shopping and then we\\u2019re at a hotel. We\\u2019re sharing a room with doors that open to the outside. It\\u2019s Victorian style or like a plantation home, it kind of reminds me of Gone With the Wind. It also reminds me of Disneyland because you can go out and be right on the street with rides and stuff. We\\u2019re all sharing this room. People are coming in and out. We\\u2019re all naked but it doesn\\u2019t seem to matter. There\\u2019s one person or being who is a light bluish green with long legs, maybe ten feet tall, long arms and reddish auburn hair that hits their shoulders. I think the being is masculine but I\\u2019m not sure. We\\u2019re hanging around with them. There are all these women - daughters and their mother. They are Australian have blond hair and super tan skin. They\\u2019re trying on clothes. It\\u2019s comical from my point of view. I\\u2019m lying in bed and watching these ladies try on their clothes and talk about their day. I don\\u2019t have any clothes on and am waiting for the room to empty so I can get up and get dressed. It never empties so I just get up and get dressed. We\\u2019re mostly naked all the time and there\\u2019s no shame or embarrassment. There are no men around except for maybe this blue being who may or may not be mascuiine, I can\\u2019t tell. We leave the hotel room on an adventure. I think we\\u2019re heading to the beach. Men keep pointing at this blue being and making fun. They\\u2019re being obnoxious. I\\u2019m getting annoyed and am like, \\u201cCan you just fucking stop and let this person be?\\u201d I\\u2019m worried for the being. Then in another part of the dream, there\\u2019s a class. I don't know the topic. I don\\u2019t have to be there because I know what it\\u2019s all about. Even though it\\u2019s mandatory for me to take the test, I choose not to go to the class. I get to the classroom and everyone has taken the test. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them. They\\u2019re at their desks and the teacher is standing up at the front of the classroom with a blackboard or whiteboard behind them. I go to take the test and the teacher is like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how well you\\u2019re going to do because you weren\\u2019t even here for the lecture.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to be fine because I know this material, it\\u2019s pretty common sense, and I\\u2019m creative.\\u201d We go to take the test and sure enough, it\\u2019s something I can totally do. I pass everything. In another part of the dream I\\u2019m with a little girl. We\\u2019re on an adventure together but it's a little bit creepy because no matter where we are, it\\u2019s just us two. I think there is a dog. We\\u2019re doing things like jumping rock formations with one a little above the other and the drop is at least a hundred feet with lava underneath, like in a video game. We\\u2019re moving through this landscape. At one point we sit down to try and feed the dog. I think there are people or things chasing us. We have a mission. Scene change: I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood at night. I\\u2019m walking down this street. The houses on the left are up higher than the houses on the right and the street runs through the middle. The houses on the left, when you look at them, the windows are facing out towards the view and there is landscaping in the front. The houses on the right are lower and that\\u2019s the entrance with fences and archways and little cement steps onto the porches. So it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m looking at the front of the houses to my right and the back of the houses to my left. They\\u2019re all really fancy. Everything is dressed up for Halloween so there\\u2019s decor, cobwebs, pumpkins and skeletons everywhere. As I go down the street, I finally get to a part with a dedicated walkway with stairs and handrails that lead down. I start to walk down and on the left hand side is a gorgeous inn that looks like a historical landmark. It\\u2019s all red with a ton of windows and white shutters. I can tell the color even in the dark.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know from waking life, but in the dream I recognize them as co-workers. We\\u2019re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they\\u2019re working. I work there, too, but I\\u2019m there on my day off. We\\u2019re talking. I\\u2019m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I\\u2019m barefoot and I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There\\u2019s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don\\u2019t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I\\u2019m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There\\u2019s some other way that I\\u2019m helping these co-workers. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an energetic helping or if I\\u2019m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They\\u2019re both younger women. I\\u2019m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn\\u2019t super clear. I just know I\\u2019m in the store with them and we\\u2019re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I\\u2019m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I\\u2019ve been hanging out with say, \\u201cOh, we have something for you.\\u201d All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we\\u2019re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There\\u2019s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don\\u2019t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, \\u201cWe have these shoes for you.\\u201d These boots are pretty incredible. They\\u2019re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I \\u2018m looking at these boots, the heel doesn\\u2019t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It\\u2019s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I\\u2019m so, so tall. I love them and they\\u2019re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I\\u2019m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re that tall in those shoes. That\\u2019s how tall you are. That\\u2019s who you are.\\u201d But I\\u2019m surprised. I didn\\u2019t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I\\u2019ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There\\u2019s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It\\u2019s an interesting mix because we\\u2019re in quarantine and we can\\u2019t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I\\u2019m thinking that for someone who\\u2019s never driven a huge tour bus before, he\\u2019s doing a pretty good job. I don\\u2019t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I\\u2019m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it\\u2019s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I\\u2019m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I\\u2019m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it\\u2019s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren\\u2019t going to tip him. I say, \\u201cYou have to tip him. That\\u2019s how this works.\\u201d I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it\\u2019s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I\\u2019m not stoked to be there. I\\u2019m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there\\u2019s stuff everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I\\u2019m somewhere I don\\u2019t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There\\u2019s definitely friction here. I\\u2019m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Josh, my beloved. We\\u2019re going to a Dane Cook show - the compedian (I haven\\u2019t listened to his shit in at least ten years). We\\u2019re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It\\u2019s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They\\u2019re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It\\u2019s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he\\u2019s done. I\\u2019m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it\\u2019s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term \\u201csausage fest\\u201d is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I\\u2019m a little confused as to why I\\u2019m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he\\u2019s finished with the set. He\\u2019s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, \\u201cWell, because you\\u2019re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, whatever!\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don\\u2019t know if Josh is still with me. I\\u2019m watching a soccer game. It\\u2019s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They\\u2019re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I\\u2019m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I\\u2019m not playing, I\\u2019m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I\\u2019m not sure who the team is that we\\u2019re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I\\u2019m wanting to play so bad. We\\u2019re outdoors at a soccer field and I\\u2019m actually sitting under a tree, it\\u2019s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I\\u2019m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I\\u2019m not playing and I\\u2019m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I\\u2019m not invited to play and it\\u2019s been a really long time since I\\u2019ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there\\u2019s busy work that has to happen. I\\u2019m watching the field morph. I can\\u2019t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I\\u2019m not part of it and I\\u2019m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don\\u2019t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. There\\u2019s my other friend Nani who I\\u2019ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m busy and I\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d She does sit with me for a little bit. While we\\u2019re sitting there, another girl comes up - I\\u2019m saying \\u201cgirl\\u201d because everyone is a teenager - and she\\u2019s got a project she\\u2019s working on. I ask her to show me. There\\u2019s wire wrapped around a needle and she\\u2019s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: \\u201cI can show you but I\\u2019m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.\\u201d It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s almost off work with the job she\\u2019s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she\\u2019s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, \\u201cOkay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you\\u2019re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.\\u201d She\\u2019s a local girl, so I can feel this air of \\u201cIck, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?\\u201d That\\u2019s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m heading home to the home I grew up in on the Big Island of Hawaii. I\\u2019m in a car. There are people with me, I think my siblings. It\\u2019s pouring rain - the kind where the roads are flooding. To get into the street that turns onto my cul-de-sac, we go over a stream. The stream is directly under the road but has come up over the road. I have to park the car. The siblings in the car are with me, but we\\u2019re not interacting - they\\u2019re kind of shadowed in the background. I have to get across the water to get into the cul-de-sac, so the car is parked. There are all these road workers here to help us. I get out and they\\u2019re very specific in showing me how to cross it. They\\u2019re going to help me get over it. They say, \\u201cThis part right here is deeper because the water has worn so much of the road away. But we\\u2019ve put some rocks down right here for you to walk across.\\u201d I get the sense that there\\u2019s also a small child with me because I\\u2019m being extra careful because I have to help them get across, too. I think it\\u2019s actually my son. The workers help us across this water and it is pretty deep, but because the rocks are there, it only goes up to our knees. Then we cross over and get onto the road. It stops raining and there\\u2019s no more water, but it is wet. We walk past a neighbor\\u2019s house. They have strawberry guava growing in their yard and it\\u2019s ripe. So I stop and I pick a bunch to eat and a bunch to take with me to save for later or turn into jam or jelly. I show my son and he\\u2019s eating some of them. We continue down the road. We walk down the road a little bit and turn right to head down the street to my house. So, we\\u2019re walking that way. We\\u2019ve hit the end where there\\u2019s a stop sign and we\\u2019re turning down to the right. To the left, I can see the horse pasture my friend used to have her horses in. I am recognizing all the houses and am like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m home, I\\u2019m home!\\u201d It feels good and normal. Then I\\u2019m walking down the street to our house. It\\u2019s different. Now my brothers have shown up. I don't think my sister is there, but we haven\\u2019t interacted yet. We get to the house. The house is different. The first thing we do is we all go into the backyard to see the stream because the stream we grew up with was such an important part of our lives, but we\\u2019d heard that our neighbor Andy had dug out his side of the stream. We get there and I look at it. The far side is a big wall that he dug out. It used to be that you could walk down the slope of our backyard into the stream and you could cross it to the other side and on the other side was a hill. There was a cow pasture and a barbed wire on the other side that you would have to cross, then walk up this hill or ridge. At the top you could see far out to a lava desert. But now, in the dream, that hill doesn\\u2019t exist. It\\u2019s just a rock wall. Instead of being flat where you could see the layers, it\\u2019s pebbled - you see this sometimes when you dig out all the layers of rock. The rocks are round and stacked on top of each other. They\\u2019re jutting out of the wall. My brothers are really sad that it\\u2019s been dug out. But I think it\\u2019s beautiful and also say, \\u201cOh my god, I dreamt about this. I dreamt this happened to the stream.\\u201d It\\u2019s created caves on the far side underneath the wall and I think it looks beautiful now. But my siblings are really upset. We turn around and it\\u2019s time to go into the house. My mom and dad are there, but the house has been changed. They live in separate parts of the house - my mom lives in the big part. Somehow there\\u2019s a sidewalk or the road is in between or underneath forming a causeway, and you have to cross the causeway to the part where my dad lives. My mom and dad are kind of getting along. They\\u2019re a little snippy with each other. But it\\u2019s clear that my mom never goes into my dad\\u2019s side. You have to go up these stairs and then walk across this causeway and it opens up into a room that\\u2019s above everything. The room looks like an attic and there\\u2019s enough stuff that it could be an attic. There are all these paintings, photographs and pictures nailed to the wall. What sticks out in my mind is that this little causeway I walk over is just plywood placed over a bunch of joists and it\\u2019s not particularly safe and the thought crosses my mind, \\u201cOh my dad is old and he shouldn\\u2019t be walking on this kind of floor where you have to walk on the joists so the plywood doesn\\u2019t tip up at the corners and come off.\\u201d It seems strange to me. My brothers are with me and we\\u2019re all going. Now my friend Dorian, who I grew up in this neighborhood, is with us, too. He\\u2019s there and keeps asking all these poignant questions. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to help me and my parents reconcile. That\\u2019s his role. He has a very loving presence. My whole life he had a loving presence, always very kind. This is radiating from him. So I look at this place where my dad is living. He says, \\u201cDo you like it? Do you like the way it\\u2019s decorated?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at all of these pictures. The walls are made of plywood and not painted, so the pictures are fading into the backaryd. There are all these pictures of ships and oceans with clouds over the top, like old-fashioned oil paintings. For whatever reason, the colors used for all three paintings match the same shades and tones of the plywood walls and they\\u2019re fading into the background. So I look at him and say, \\u201cIf you paint just this section with all the paintings white, you\\u2019ll be able to see the paintings better.\\u201d He crosses his arms in the way he used to and puts one hand up to his mouth and does the thing he used to do - stop and think and nod for a little bit. Then he moves out of the picture. Now my mom is front and center. We\\u2019re in the same space, but now the space has transformed and it\\u2019s hers. So my dad is there, but it\\u2019s not his space anymore. She has work to do. She always had work to do when we were growing up. There\\u2019s a computer on a desk that\\u2019s now in this space and piles of paperwork. But she also has piles of makeup. She says, \\u201cOh I have to get to a trial. Doyou think you can help me look good for this trial?\\u201d When I was growing up, I always thought my mom did her makeup so shitty because she never changed the way she did it from the 60s - weird blue eyeshadow and clumpy mascara. She just didn\\u2019t have a lot of skill with her makeup. So in the dream, she\\u2019s asking me to do it, because she knows I know how to do makeup. I\\u2019m looking at all this makeup she has. She has ten or twelve of the exact same eyeshadows and lip creams and all these things she wouldn\\u2019t wear because they are way too bright - they\\u2019re not the right color. She also has this makeup brush I need to use. So I put all this foundation on her face to smooth out her skin. It\\u2019s thick and way too much. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMom, if you\\u2019re going to have me do this, y0ou need to trust me and let me rub this in.\\u201d So I take this brush and I\\u2019m trying to rub it in. She\\u2019s sort of fighting me about it and I\\u2019m getting exasperated. I say, \\u201cStop, let me do this. You asked me to do this. Stop.\\u201d My friend Darisu is there and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, let her do this. You\\u2019re going to have to trust her to rub the makeup in.\\u201d I finally get her face to be a blank slate with all the foundation. It takes a while with this one brush. In the meantime I ask her why she has twelve of this one compact. She looks at my dad and says, \\u201cWell, he was trying to order me a surprise, but he ordered like twelve of them and now I have twelve of these things I never use.\\u201d In my head, I think, \\u201cThat was always your relationship. He was always trying to do nice, kind things for you, but he got it wrong by just a little bit. It would have been lovely if he had ordered the right amount and the right shade of these compacts, but instead he ordered twelve of a color you can never use. But instead of you communicating to him that you didn\\u2019t like that, you just got annoyed with him, rolled your eyes and totally disrespected him.\\u201dIn the dream, I\\u2019m watching that dynamic play out. I want out of it. It\\u2019s not my business. I can tell it\\u2019s them. I was thinking it was just her normal hoarding habits, but it turns out it came from my dad, at least in this aspect of the dream. We go to where her eyeshadows are because it\\u2019s time for me to do her eyes. She has a ton of different colors. I know that is actually her. In this part, she just wanted all of these things for herself. So I pick out an eyeshadow. What\\u2019s fascinating is I pick out this blue that is dark blue glitter, drag queen style. She\\u2019s looking at me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cJust trust me.\\u201d So I goto put it on and she keeps flinching and moving out of the way. Dorian tells her, \\u201cYou have to hold still. You have to trust her. Let her do this.\\u201d In the meantime, I\\u2019m concentrating so hard to put this eyeshadow on her and make her look nice, I get the sense that we\\u2019re running out of time because she has to hurry up and get to the trial. There\\u2019s also a part when we had gone into the house, there were a couple of cats. These cats are small like house cats but their fur looks like a cheetah - wild cats - and there\\u2019s one here. I\\u2019m talking to it and looking at it. It\\u2019s talking back as a sentient guide in this dream. It\\u2019s acting like a human. It\\u2019s got a pink underlayer. It\\u2019s fur is almost holographic, so it turns pink when it moves, but it still has the cheetah spots. I look up and there\\u2019s this cat print or motif in this attic/annex that she\\u2019s in that has all her makeup, work desk and other stuff. It\\u2019s very striking to me, because at one point in the dream, the cat wants to be held. I\\u2019m holding and petting it, but it\\u2019s purring and chewing on my finger and telling me stories. When I\\u2019m doing my mom\\u2019s makeup, I see this cat print everywhere - on the pillows, the wall, upholstering of a chair. She\\u2019s wearing some, too. I finally finished with her makeup and am not sure if this looks good because she wouldn't let me do it the way I wanted to do. But she\\u2019s gotta go. She says thank you and goes off to the trial. Then the dream changes completely and I\\u2019m with a friend. She\\u2019s a business coach. She takes me to one of her client\\u2019s houses and her client is doing quite well and so is the client\\u2019s husband because they live in a really nice house. I can see the ocean out of the windows and off the balcony of their house. The inside is very modern looking and minimalist, so there\\u2019s not a lot in it in contrast to my parents\\u2019 house. There are beautiful wood floors and tall walls with tall windows. The walls are painted grey and the furniture is black. It\\u2019s all elegant, very understated and minimalistic. There\\u2019s a gathering of people because this woman is telling her story of how she got to be a wealthy business woman. I\\u2019m in the audience. She talks about how hard she works and how she couldn\\u2019t have done it without my friend who is the business coach. Then the business coach says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you talk with Cinnamon?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m talking with this woman and her husband. They want to know what I do and how I got to what I\\u2019m doing. I tell the whole story of all the different aspects of my life that came together to this point of where I\\u2019m a priestess who helps people be in their bodies and how that happened through me getting a degree in exercise science and nutrition. She says, \\u201cOh, your story is very similar to mine. The only difference is I\\u2019m making a ton of money.\\u201dI look at her and am like, \\u201cYup, I just haven\\u2019t cracked that money thing yet. Haven\\u2019t figured that out.\\u201d My coach is like, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m having you meet her and tell the story because i wanted you to see how exactly similar the two of you are. You could do it at any point.\\u201d The husband was listening to the story and very supportive. Both of them are people of color. She may be Asian and he could maybe have some Arab blood. In the meantime, I can hear and see the ocean. It\\u2019s gotten stormy outside and there\\u2019s whitecaps on the water. But even though the house is very close to the edge of the water, I feel safe. I\\u2019m not too worried about the water coming up, but I can see it spraying up on the windows, which is very interesting. There\\u2019s a seagull outside trying to find a place to nest and land out of the wind. This is happening while she is telling her story and I am telling my story. Then at some point, I am sitting down. There is a sense of magic in this dream - as if these two people are my guides or my guides are orchestrating it or there are guides in the audience. I turn from our conversation and to a computer. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019ve been having conversations with other people. I look at the screen and see my friend Maria. She and I are having a flirtation through the computer screen. I can\\u2019t remember all the things we said, but I get the feeling of space and distance between us that is happening in real life - we are no longer friends in real life. I\\u2019m asking her, \\u201cWhere are you? Why aren\\u2019t we friends? Why aren\\u2019t we hanging out together?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember her response. Also, somewhere in the dream, I\\u2019m having a conversation with my dad and he\\u2019s talking about Doug who is a guy who used to work for my mom. They have a condo that they bought together with somebody else. My dad keeps saying that Doug owes him money for the condo. I keep saying, \\u201cNobody has any money. What are you going to do about it?\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cWell the option has always been that he can pay money or do somworktrade to live there and his roommate can pay money.\\u201d I find it interesting that work trade is on the table as an option for living in this condo.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a boat. I\\u2019m with my husband and son and somebody else, a captain who is directing the boat. There are other boats in the water. We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I\\u2019m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he\\u2019s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I\\u2019m looking around and notice it\\u2019s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I\\u2019m looking through the papers and see that there\\u2019s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I\\u2019m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He\\u2019s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It\\u2019s really rough and she hasn\\u2019t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It\\u2019s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I\\u2019m at a celebration for Ted, an award\\u2019s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I\\u2019m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there. His dad, who is dead in waking life, is there and drinking a huge glass mug of whisky and ice. His mom and I are sipping nicer whisky that I had brought. I make eye contact with him, smile and nod my head in congratulations for his accomplishments.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a coffee shop and I see a friend of mine who is working there. I haven\\u2019t seen her for a while. I ask if she wants to hang out but it feels strange. She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it\\u2019s not very big, there\\u2019s not a lot of space. She\\u2019s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I\\u2019m asking her while she\\u2019s busy, and it\\u2019s not that she doesn\\u2019t want to hang out. The scene changes and I\\u2019m in a residential area of a town and I\\u2019m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I\\u2019m walking up a hill and she\\u2019s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I\\u2019m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She\\u2019s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It\\u2019s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don\\u2019t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They\\u2019re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I\\u2019m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It\\u2019s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there\\u2019s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there\\u2019s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I\\u2019m a little bit wary because there\\u2019s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don\\u2019t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don\\u2019t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I\\u2019m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It\\u2019s actually another sort of twilight, but it\\u2019s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it\\u2019s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I\\u2019m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it\\u2019s cordial. Suddenly he\\u2019s talking to me like we\\u2019re still lovers. I\\u2019m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle.\\u201d The voice is also telling me, \\u201cYou can still be kind, you can still be kind.\\u201d So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he\\u2019s going to take me with him. So we\\u2019ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there\\u2019s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It\\u2019s where he lives. He has an apartment. He\\u2019s very very familiar with me and I\\u2019m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He\\u2019s a surfer and he\\u2019s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he\\u2019s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I\\u2019m actually quite glad that he\\u2019s going. So again, I\\u2019m being as encouraging as possible. I\\u2019m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don\\u2019t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I\\u2019m just sending him off for a little bit and then he\\u2019ll be back. But in my mind I\\u2019m sending him off like he\\u2019s going off on a quest and I won't\\u2019 see him for a long while. I\\u2019m relieved that I wont\\u2019 see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he\\u2019s really proud of. I\\u2019m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he\\u2019s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I\\u2019m satisfied with how I\\u2019ve handled all of it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a condo - it\\u2019s huge. There\\u2019s a huge kitchen. The living room is gigantic. The bathroom has two separate showers. There\\u2019s a balcony that I walk out onto and can see the ocean from it. I live in this condo with my kids. They\\u2019re not here with me right now, but I feel comfortable here. All of my stuff is in the condo. Now my ex is here with me and we\\u2019re being cordial with each other. He\\u2019s actually even really friendly and seems happy to see me. I notice he has some of his stuff with him and it bothers me that he\\u2019s brought it and put it into the condo. This condo is one that I received in the divorce and yet somehow he is able to buy it and take it for himself. I\\u2019m not clear on why he\\u2019s even there, except that all of a sudden, I can feel that his energy is moving into this place with me. I decide to go take a shower and he decides he\\u2019ll go take a shower, too. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near me and I don\\u2019t want him to see me naked. I go to take a shower and his desk and other office stuff is in the shower stall so I can\\u2019t get in. I\\u2019m really mad because I did not say okay - I did not say it was alright for him to move his stuff in there and to be in this place. I\\u2019m starting to get agitated and his demeanor is changing from one of kindness and being happy to see me to really domineering. I ask him to take his stuff out of the shower, but it\\u2019s taking him forever, so I just decide not to and I leave. Then I say, \\u201cYou know we have to have the conversation because this isn\\u2019t what I want and this isn\\u2019t true and this isn\\u2019t going to last. Now he gets really shut down. We actually walk out of the condo into a lobby type area that\\u2019s part of the complex. There\\u2019s a huge Christmas tree in the lobby area. We can see out to the ocean from where we\\u2019re standing. I tell him I don\\u2019t want him living with me or in my space and that he needs to leave. But he tells me that he owns the condo and it is his now and that I can\\u2019t stay there. We go back up to the condo and I\\u2019m racking my brain because I don\\u2019t have any place to go. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to go and I don\\u2019t have any money. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to live where the kids can be with me. I start to pack up all my stuff and as I\\u2019m doing so, his girlfriend comes in. We sit down at the table in the kitchen. It\\u2019s an oval table with a couple of leaves in it. The chairs don\\u2019t match. In fact one of the chairs is a lot shorter. It kind of makes me laugh, but I don\\u2019t sit in that one. He tells me that he now owns the condo, that it\\u2019s his place and he\\u2019s going to share it with the girlfriend. I ask him how much he pays every month and he says they split the $5,000 monthly mortgage. I know that is not something I can pay. I see that the kids - her kids and our kids - are there and they\\u2019re running around. They\\u2019re happy to be in this space. I know I\\u2019m not going to live there with them. So I gather as much of my things as I can and I leave. I don\\u2019t know exactly what I\\u2019m going to do. I know the kids are okay for now, so that\\u2019s alright. As I walk out the front door, he walks with me and he\\u2019s essentially escorting me out and off the properties. We\\u2019re walking through this neighborhood that looks really familiar and I realize I\\u2019ve been in this neighborhood before. Down at the end of the neighborhood is a crystal mine. I\\u2019ve been to this crystal mine before and I can\\u2019t remember when or why, I just remember there\\u2019s crystals there. We walk by a house whose roof is being replaced. The woman who owns the house is on top of it and the roof is being replaced with large large tumbled crystals. They are huge stones and she\\u2019s sliding them into these lanes that fit on top of her roof. She\\u2019s about an eighth of the way done. I watch as she climbs down the ladder. She has these special shoes on and walks out to the crystal mine. My ex and I are still walking and we start to follow her. But I want him to leave because there\\u2019s no reason for him to be near me. Then the scene shifts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a conference center. I\\u2019ve happened upon a group of people. They all look like they work with nature conservation in some way - forestry, seed saving, permaculture, climate change, soil, etc. I\\u2019m really interested in what\\u2019s happening here. I just sort of add myself to the group. This is the first day of their meeting. Everyone circles up and they all have name tags except me. The guide notices I don\\u2019t have a name tag and she asks if I registered for the day. I tell her no and I didn\\u2019t know about this until I just happened upon it, but I feel like I really need to be here. She stops for a bit and thinks about what I\\u2019ve said then says, \\u201cOkay, come with me.\\u201d Everyone breaks for gathering their things and getting ready for the day of being on the land and learning about the seeds, roots, berries, flowers and their conservation as well as their medicinal uses. I\\u2019m walking with the guide. She is a young woman with long blond hair. She has grown up in relationship with the land. We are at Esalen - my dream form of Esalen. We need to get permission from the front office so that I can be here, even though I\\u2019m not planning to stay overnight. They still need to register me for the course. We\\u2019re looking, but can\\u2019t find anyone with authority. We stop at her trailer so she can get a certificate and papers for me. The trailer is really interesting. I recognize it as somewhere I\\u2019ve been before, even though I haven\\u2019t in waking life. The trailer is reserved for visiting faculty. Before the closets were full of Burning Man style costume clothes that the teachers could wear around the campus. Another wall is lined with narrow shelves filled with small cylindrical bottles of herbs of all colors. There\\u2019s another set of wider shelves in the corner by the bed with books. It\\u2019s a sweet and comfortable place. I notice that the clothes have been traded out for doll-sized clothes, so it\\u2019s more for decoration than use. It\\u2019s a new COVID policy shift, so it still has the old flavor of how things used to be, but now the clothes can\\u2019t actually be worn. She gets what she needs and fills her bag for the day of teaching on the land. We leave. We pass through a dining area. They are just now putting out lunch. She suggests we stay for lunch. It\\u2019s a spread of delicious mini sliders - hamburgers and hot dogs with gourmet toppings, and caprese vegetarian ones. It all looks so beautiful and delicious. I surreptitiously reach for one and eat it, trying to look like I\\u2019m not actually chewing because I\\u2019m not registered and I\\u2019m not really supposed to be here. She is sitting at a table with colleagues and I go back for more because it\\u2019s so tasty! I want to try at least one of everything. I see my friend Mo from graduate school. I\\u2019m happily surprised to see him. He looks a bit sad. He tells me he\\u2019s been spending more time in San Francisco. I think that\\u2019s interesting because he lives in the East Bay. He says he\\u2019s been in SF more because he and his wife aren\\u2019t really doing well right now. He was married four or more years after me. I tell him he\\u2019ll be fine and his marriage will be okay because there are phases in a marriage when you don\\u2019t feel super connected, but you\\u2019ll come out of it and appreciate each other again. He\\u2019s hopeful but a bit weary to put his hope in my words. I look around and see that my guide has left. I tell him I have to go and hope to see him around later. I am looking for the group again. I\\u2019m in the huge conference center with many floors. There are start-up companies in meeting, people working on computers, miniature libraries with specialized topics for research. I\\u2019m wandering around and feeling lost. I find a woman sitting behind a glass - it looks like an information desk. I ask her about the group I\\u2019m looking for. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m more in charge of the people who rent space here for months and years rather than day visits.\\u201d She comes out from behind the glass and we go down the elevator. We get to an area that she says is their meeting space. It\\u2019s not at all familiar. I look way down and think I recognize some of the people. I really want to find them because I really want to go on this learning trek and know this is important knowledge to gather. She leaves me there and I\\u2019m trying to find my way down to the people. I feel at a complete loss and I\\u2019m lost.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a garage sitting in a lawn chair. I think I\\u2019m with my dad. We\\u2019re shooting the shit and doing a running commentary on the people we can see out of the garage opening who are coming across the opening. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood. I don\\u2019t remember what we\\u2019re talking about. At some point in the dream, I go, \\u201cWait, I have to record this dream for Ana!\\u201d I record the dream for her in the dream. I play it back for myself in the dream and it\\u2019s all mumbled. I can\\u2019t understand myself and I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m not speaking English or if I just mumbled the whole time or what happened. The playback is really garbled. The scene changes. I remember a big pool of water and hockey sticks. My youngest brother was there. We were doing something, but that has escaped me.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a grocery store and it\\u2019s very dark out. It\\u2019s not night, but there are dark clouds. Everything is dark out and even the grocery store is dark and dreary even though there are fluorescent lights. It\\u2019s pretty packed with people. I have a cart and I\\u2019m shopping for the kids. I\\u2019m doing the week\\u2019s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I\\u2019m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me. I\\u2019m walking through the aisles and my kids and are talking about what they want for dinner. Then my ex shows up and he says, \\u201cWell you can\\u2019t actually have the kids. You\\u2019re not going to get to spend a lot of time with them. You\\u2019re just shopping, then I\\u2019m going to take all of this and leave with the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m fucking pissed that he\\u2019s treating me like that and talking me like that and manipulating the kids in front of me. I can see that they\\u2019re torn because they were just having a great time with me, but when he showed up, their allegiance went straight to him. He\\u2019s saying he\\u2019s just going to take the groceries and all this because he\\u2019s paying for them. I\\u2019m so done with him and seeing the kids frustrated that I say, \\u201cNo, you do it. I\\u2019m out of here. I\\u2019m not going to participate in this.\\u201d The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very \\u201cfuck you\\u2019ish\\u201d way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It\\u2019s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I\\u2019m so mad, but I\\u2019m very clear that I\\u2019m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I\\u2019m not playing his game. I\\u2019m not doing it his way.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a home, I don\\u2019t know whose it is and I don\\u2019t recognize it, but I think it\\u2019s mine. I\\u2019m getting on a plane in the morning and I have the ticket and am getting ready. I don\\u2019t know what time I need to be there. I just know that tomorrow is the day I\\u2019m flying. I\\u2019m a little bit younger, maybe a teenager. I\\u2019m excited for what\\u2019s happening tomorrow. I go to bed, then get up in the morning and start packing. Maybe it\\u2019s 9 or 10 in the morning. My dad comes in out of nowhere and is like, \\u201cHey, what time is your flight?\\u201d I go to look at the ticket - it\\u2019s an old fashioned ticket stub - and the flight was at 5am. Clearly I\\u2019ve missed it and I\\u2019m panicking. I ask him if he can call the airlines and see if we can change the flight. I\\u2019m still not packed. I\\u2019m going to another country. There\\u2019s a sense of, \\u201cDammit, Rose, how did you not look at the ticket stub right in front of you and make sure you were ready to go at the time you needed to get going?\\u201d I\\u2019m asking my dad to help, but feel like I should be doing it, not him. But I still need to finish packing. Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t I just imagine what it would be like to be in this country.\\u201d So I start imagining that I\\u2019ve kept the plane or I get on the plane and catch up to them. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m there with them. It\\u2019s a bunch of German kids speaking German. I don\\u2019t speak German, but they also speak English, so that\\u2019s okay. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s the girl that missed her flight.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cRight, but now I\\u2019m here.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a bunch of teenagers messing around. I\\u2019m standing in an airport looking at the teleprompter and they\\u2019re standing in front of it, bouncing around and teasing and laughing. We\\u2019re supposed to be doing something. There\\u2019s a chaperone somewhere trying to herd us and get us to our next destination and teach us some things. This part of the dream continues on but fades out. Then, Wendy is in my dreams somewhere and I find this bizarre because I haven\\u2019t dreamt of her in over a year and haven\\u2019t had any interaction with her at all. I don\\u2019t remember exactly what\\u2019s happening. I think we\\u2019re talking about babies.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a hotel conference room, sitting next to my mom. There are a lot of other people sitting in rows. I look down and see that I\\u2019m wearing a light blue leotard and a flimsy skirt made of scarves. It isn\\u2019t secured well to my waist. I see that my mom has elastic wrapped around her skirt and I ask to borrow some\\u2026.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and my siblings are there as well as my mom and dad. My youngest brother is the one I\\u2019m interacting with. They\\u2019re young, it\\u2019s when they were babies. My ex is there, he\\u2019s somewhere in the mix. My current lover is with me, as well. We\\u2019re trying to clean the bedroom and get my younger brothers ready for school. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I\\u2019m getting frustrated trying to get them ready. My lover and I want to take a shower. We walk into the bathroom and the entire bathroom is covered in shit and grey water and toilet paper. It\\u2019s like a toilet backed up all the way to the ceiling. There are white tiles on the shower wall and the whole bathroom is white, but it\\u2019s covered in this grey old toilet paper and poop. We\\u2019re both standing there barefoot, having walked in and are like, \\u201coh my god, this is so gross,\\u201d but not having another option. We just had to clean it. We\\u2019re both naked and trying to clean it. It\\u2019s just so gross. At one point we fill the whole bathroom with water to wash it all away. Neither of us are happy about it. I have some feelings of embarrassment and I can tell my lover is annoyed, but it\\u2019s just something we have to do. So we clean it. Then we get my little brother off to a race - it\\u2019s like a go-cart race. We get him to the race in time after cleaning the disgusting bathroom. So gross.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house or residential school. I\\u2019m taking my examinations - writing, math and dance. Eac person has their own private space to write. I go outside to the yard with my blue books and find a stone grotto to sit in. it\\u2019s dark outside, night. After I finish writing, I go back inside for the dance examination. This is a small performance based audition. I enter into the audition late and displace another woman who was until now guaranteed a spot in the school. Afterward, people begin talking about my skill and wondering where I learned to dance like that. I walk into another room where they keep the wild leopards. There is a pool with rocks along the side and some trees - an attempt to replicate a watering hole in their natural environment. I see a huge one - a paleolithic version of the leopard. This one is standing on a rock in the water. A younger adolescent leopard is lying splayed out on the beach, mouth open wide and teeth showing - it reminds me of a skinned lion rug I\\u2019ve seen before in waking life. There\\u2019s also a paleolithic leopard kitten crawling around the rocks. I'm surprised to see these wild animals inside a concrete room without windows. I go to another room that is a workroom with tools, like a woodwork or metal shop.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house that is supposed to be my childhood home, but it\\u2019s been completely remodeled and changed. My parents are both there. I don\\u2019t know if I see my mom, but I do know she\\u2019s around. I do see my dad. I go into his study at one point and talk with him, which is weird because there definitely wasn\\u2019t a study in the house I grew up in. it\\u2019s got two stories. The upper story is where the kids\\u2019 bedrooms are there. My two younger brothers have their own bedrooms, and they\\u2019re younger, like seven or eight. I think I\\u2019m a teenager in this dream. Their bedrooms are really big and bright. They\\u2019ve got big windows. Everything is a mess, really messy. There\\u2019s food smeared in places, car toys and blocks everywhere on the bedroom floor. There is a nanny but she\\u2019s nowhere to be found. I think I walk out the doorway of my brother\\u2019s bedroom into the hallway and she\\u2019s in this little alcove, laying there eating something. She has food spilled on her. I think she\\u2019s pregnant, which is weird. No one is actually watching the kids. There\\u2019s also a goat running around the upper level of the house, I\\u2019m not sure why. I\\u2019m looking for my dad to ask him who\\u2019s watching the kids and who\\u2019s in charge here. I go into his study and he doesn\\u2019t really give me an answer. He\\u2019s not very there. He does talk to me but I don\\u2019t get an answer to my questions. I think my mom is in the kitchen but I don\\u2019t seek her out. I go back upstairs to my own bedroom. It doesn\\u2019t look anything like my bedroom that I actually grew up in. I go to the windows and look out and can see the house next to us is the house that was next door when I was growing up in Maui, Lahaina. It\\u2019s all this slapdash pieces of wood, it looks like a shed, but it\\u2019s a house. There\\u2019s laundry hung on the outside and these raised bed gardens, but it\\u2019s very rundown. That\\u2019s to my right. When I look straight out, instead of seeing more houses or the mountains I expect to see because that was the scene growing up, I see the ocean. The coastline goes down from my house, and there\\u2019s hibiscus and ti leaf growing. I see this channel and another island or land across the channel. In my dream I\\u2019m thinking that the landscape outside my house has changed to something completely different, how interesting that everything is restructuring. I realize that this is a restructuring dream of my inner landscape. Because I see the outer landscape restructured as well, I realize it\\u2019s a collective - everyone\\u2019s past stories are being rewritten so they are freed from the chaos on the inside. Then the dream changes. I\\u2019m on vacation and going on an adventure. I\\u2019m with Josh. we\\u2019re in a condo-apartment-hotel hybrid. The lights are on but it\\u2019s still dark. In my childhood house earlier in the dream, everything was really bright and sunny with lots of light coming through windows. In this, it\\u2019s dark and cold. I have my daughter and son with me, they\\u2019re maybe seven or five in this dream. There\\u2019s another little girl running around, but I\\u2019m not sure who she is. I have them for a little bit of time. But they\\u2019re both wanting to go back to their dad and don\\u2019t want to connect with me. Josh is making pancakes for them. One pancake drops on the floor and one of the kids just walks over it. He gets mad at them and then gets mad at me telling me I\\u2019m not disciplining my kids enough. I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cWell, that was an accident and I don\\u2019t need to discipline them for stepping on a pancake that got dropped.\\u201d He gets upset that they\\u2019re not eating the pancakes at all. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell I\\u2019m not going to force them to do any of that. They keep saying they want to go back to their dad\\u2019s so the more I force them, the more they want to leave.\\u201d This whole time, the threat of my ex is hanging over me and that\\u2019s why it feels so dark and cold. I can feel it heavy in my chest with fear and frustration and a total inability to show up for my kids in the way I want to connect with them. They even look at me like I\\u2019m something to be feared or wary of, they don\\u2019t want to connect.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house that looks a lot like my grandmother\\u2019s house except the ceilings are really, really high. It\\u2019s like a modular home. I\\u2019m with my mom in the kitchen and my dad somewhere and my sister somewhere. My aunt is there, too. I guess the whole family that usually gathers for Thanksgiving is there. My mom is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m with her and we\\u2019re baking bread. The counters are already covered with loaves of bread. It smells so good! There are some artisan loaves that we\\u2019re just finishing up. We\\u2019ve just tried this new style of baking and we\\u2019re looking forward to trying it. I take those loaves out of the oven and place them on the counter. We slice some pieces of bread, sampling different loaves for the meal we\\u2019re preparing. I step out of the kitchen and walk down the hall. I go into my grandmother\\u2019s bedroom. This is when I notice the ceilings are really high and there\\u2019s a loft. Also, her bedroom is on the opposite side of the hall than it was in waking life. There\\u2019s a wall partition and around the corner is a big green bed, her bed. There\\u2019s a little area with toys - a little kids table and bright primary colors, a little hammer, balls and art supplies. She set it up for the grandchildren to play with. I see my aunt up the ladder on the loft preparing a couple beds for the family to sleep. There\\u2019s also a bed downstairs with a pink bedspread. We\\u2019re preparing the house so everyone can rest. I go out and see my sister and grandmother in the laundry room, which she also didn\\u2019t have in real life. They\\u2019re taking Christmas decorations out of boxes. They\\u2019re taking out candy canes that are individually wrapped in plastic, then wrapped again in bunches. My sister and grandmother are taking the candy canes out - they\\u2019re all different colors, rainbow, blue, purple, solid red. I don\\u2019t see the traditional red and white striped candy canes. It\\u2019s so good to see my grandmother even though I only see her from behind. It feels like Thanksgivings and Christmases in the past.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my ex again (this is the second night in a row). There is tension between the two of us. He says he\\u2019s moving and wants to take some of the furniture. We\\u2019re standing in the kid\\u2019s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it\\u2019s very dark in there. I see that there\\u2019s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don\\u2019t care if he takes them. There\\u2019s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I\\u2019m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I\\u2019m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I\\u2019m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I\\u2019m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I\\u2019m still a mother. I still have two children. They\\u2019re still with me. And my godmother says let\\u2019s just go. All of a sudden we\\u2019re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I\\u2019m starting to get upset because I realize we didn\\u2019t pack anything. There\\u2019s no food. There\\u2019s no water. I don\\u2019t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don\\u2019t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I\\u2019m sure. I say, \\u201cyes, we don\\u2019t have any of the things we need.\\u201d She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there\\u2019s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we\\u2019re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we\\u2019re heading back the other way. We\\u2019re all fine, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, \\u201c well, we\\u2019re going to take a shortcut.\\u201d And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He\\u2019s young - he\\u2019s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He\\u2019s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There\\u2019s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there\\u2019s display cases and a buffet table. I\\u2019m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don\\u2019t because I\\u2019m allergic to rice and I\\u2019m allergic to soy and I can\\u2019t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I\\u2019m heartbroken because number one, I\\u2019m starving, and number two, I haven\\u2019t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There\\u2019s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She\\u2019s cooking. I\\u2019m trying to load the dishwasher. It\\u2019s a very complicated dishwasher and I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in. She\\u2019s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There\\u2019s enough though. I\\u2019m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever\\u2019s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, \\u201cCan you please open this?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy? I don\\u2019t drink.\\u201d Even though it\\u2019s beer, it\\u2019s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are you all drinking?\\u201d We\\u2019re at a gathering, maybe it\\u2019s Christmas or New Year\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t know, but there\\u2019s a celebration happening. Of course, it\\u2019s my family, so they\\u2019re all drinking and I\\u2019m the only one that doesn\\u2019t drink. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy am I opening this bottle for her?\\u201d I think she\\u2019s trying to give it to me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, here\\u2019s your bottle of beer-wine.\\u201d I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I\\u2019m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird\\u2019s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn\\u2019t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house, it\\u2019s kind of dark. It\\u2019s my mom\\u2019s house, I know that. There was a lot of dream before this, but this is the only part of the dream I can remember. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there, I\\u2019m just there. My mom is there and I\\u2019m not entirely comfortable. She\\u2019s a younger version of herself - she\\u2019s in her forties, I think. I\\u2019m my age. I\\u2019m in a part of the room with a bed. I\\u2019m sitting on the bed and looking out the window. I can see this gigantic rat; it\\u2019s the size of a racoon. Or maybe it\\u2019s a koala. It\\u2019s like a cross between all three of those animals. It\\u2019s flying from some trees to a spot outside of the house where there is a hole big enough for it to get into. It gets in and crawls into a box across the room from me. I\\u2019m horrified and grossed out because this thing is really big and freaking me out with its long teeth. I\\u2019m not sure why it\\u2019s in the house. It\\u2019s like when you find a mouse in your house and it\\u2019s not your favorite thing in the world to see that you\\u2019re sharing space with the rodents. But this rodent thing is huge. I have this general sense of frustration. I\\u2019m mad that I\\u2019m there. I don't want to be spending time with my mom or be in the same space as her. She\\u2019s not in the room with me now though and not interacting. I\\u2019m just generally upset. Then she does come into the room. She\\u2019s pointing out to me some books that she\\u2019s read. I\\u2019m looking at the books on this dusty-ass bookshelf. The inside of the house is dark and reminds me of an old haunted house, like a Victorian era style with rugs and chandeliers. It\\u2019s darker inside and very dim lighting. These books are written by Loreena McKennitt. This is hilarious because Loreena McKennitt is actually a Canadian singer of Cetlic songs. But in my dream, she has written all these books and my mom is like, \\u201cOh yeah, I remember reading all of these.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at all of them and am like, \\u201cDid I read these?\\u201d I would be surprised if I didn\\u2019t read these because I read almost everything that was fantasy fiction fairy, whatever, and that\\u2019s what definitely these books are about. On the front of the books is art deco artwork of fairies and goddesses and fantasy genre. There is a whole series. I think I\\u2019ve read these and I think if I started reading them, I would remember what they\\u2019re all about. My curiosity is quite peaked. I want to read them. Then my mom goes and gets clothes out of a dryer. But it\\u2019s not clothes, it\\u2019s lame tablecloths, which is funny because in real life, her event planning side of her business she had tons and tons of lame tablecloths for the tables when she would set up parties. So she\\u2019s folding these tablecloths and kind of doing mom things around me. She\\u2019s also showing me clothes that she\\u2019s sewn. Or maybe she\\u2019s wearing them? I look down and see a little girl and it\\u2019s my daughter but also me but also my mom, all three of us together. She\\u2019s wearing a skirt I made and an old thrifted Christmas sweater and another jacket over it. Her entire outfit is so cute. It\\u2019s funky, the colors match\\u2019ish because the skirt I made is black, white and red taffeta plaid with black velvet vines over the top of it. The sweater is like an ugly Christmas sweater you\\u2019d find at a thrift store, but it looks so cute on her. Then she has this red velvet coat over the top. She\\u2019s maybe five. She\\u2019s super cute and I can\\u2019t believe how cute she is with her outfit and how she\\u2019s acting. I\\u2019m wanting to love on her. But she\\u2019s kind of standoffish and not wanting to interact with me. Then I look out the window and see that rat thing. I think I had gotten rid of it. It takes a flying leap back to the house and comes in through its hole. It creeps down the bookcase. I\\u2019m watching it and am like, \\u201cEw, go away!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at my mom and she\\u2019s like shrugging her shoulders like this thing just kind of lives here. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s a huge whatever! It\\u2019s pooping all over the place. It smells and it steals stuff and makes trash. And it\\u2019s freaky looking!\\u201d But then as it creeps closer to me, it morphs into a koala and looks kind of cute. It\\u2019s acting like a dog where it wants to be accepted. It comes really close to me, then drops to the floor and rolls over on its belly like it wants me to pet it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh hell no, I\\u2019m not petting you.\\u201d Then it rolls back over and climbs up to its perch. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cGross, but whatever, it\\u2019s not my house.\\u201d Then my attention goes back to my mom because she\\u2019s still folding the tablecloths. She has shown me the books and now we are having a conversation and talking about the outfit of the cute little girl who has now disappeared. Now I notice that my mom only has one arm! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHow are you folding those tablecloths and when did you lose an arm?\\u201d It\\u2019s just a stub at the shoulder joint. We are sitting on the floor, leaning against the bookshelf and I\\u2019m asking where her arm went. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you remember?\\u201d And I don\\u2019t. At this point, it becomes less my mom and a completely different character I don\\u2019t even know. She\\u2019s talking about all the kids she had and like, \\u201cRemember when your brothers did this and this and this? I had my arm then.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, but when did you lose your arm?\\u201d So bizarre.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s very cluttered. One of my brothers is with me. All of a sudden there\\u2019s a bunch of tiny little black bugs swarming. They all hatched at once and they\\u2019re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We\\u2019re both like, eww get them off. I\\u2019m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There\\u2019s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It\\u2019s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It\\u2019s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, \\u201cNo, no. Give me that rat. That\\u2019s our friend. That\\u2019s who\\u2019s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There\\u2019s more space between the rat and the cast. While I\\u2019m looking at this rat, part of me is like, \\u201ceww, it\\u2019s a rat,\\u201d and another part of me is like, \\u201cwell, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.\\u201d It\\u2019s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it\\u2019s a rat and it\\u2019s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I\\u2019m in a home. The part of the home I\\u2019m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It\\u2019s a square room with a round table in the center. It\\u2019s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he\\u2019s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he\\u2019s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frustrating, and I\\u2019m not entirely sure what we\\u2019re talking about. Then my ex shows up, or at least his voice does - I don\\u2019t actually see him. He tells me that he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with the kids. In the conversation with my ex father in law it was apparent that I was going to need to stay in the house that I\\u2019m in and I can\\u2019t move anywhere because it\\u2019s my only place of residence. So when my ex tells me he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with my kids, I\\u2019m pissed because I can\\u2019t get out of this house that I\\u2019m in. I\\u2019m super mad that they\\u2019re all in Hawaii. They\\u2019re not even from there. They\\u2019re just these white people who will just buy land and move there and my kids are going to be there without me to show them what Hawaii really is. I\\u2019m just mad that I\\u2019m stuck in this house. Somehow whatever agreement I\\u2019ve made with my ex father in law is keeping me stuck. Then I\\u2019m pissed at my ex because he just makes decisions about the kids without asking and just does whatever he wants.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a log cabin. It\\u2019s not just a square, it\\u2019s an L-shape. I\\u2019m there with some friends and people I don\\u2019t know. There are about eight people all together. I\\u2019m socializing with and having conversations with the people that I didn't know before I got there amongst what feels like to be an atmosphere of companionship and camaraderie. All of us leave the log cabin and go downtown to have something to eat. It looks like an old-fashioned ice cream parlor with those milkshake machines that are slim and have the metal cups. I scoop the ice cream into the metal cup and pour the milk in, then insert the cup onto the whisk. The cup stays there while the machine shakes the milk with the whisk then you have this cool frosty iced milkshake. While we\\u2019re in there, one of the guys and his friend begin talking to me. I feel an attraction to the guy that\\u2019s talking to me. I know he feels it, too. He reacts as though he does but he tells me that he has to leave in the morning, so he\\u2019s trying to fix me up with his friend who I do not feel any chemistry with. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not interested in your friend.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me and saying, \\u201cBut my friend is a really nice guy and he\\u2019s single.\\u201d I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBe that as it may, I feel nothing more than friends with him, so no.\\u201d The guy I\\u2019m talking to relents. We continue flirting, standing close with a little body contact. I do realize he\\u2019s leaving in the morning. We go back to the cabin. I\\u2019m really sleepy. It\\u2019s like 3:30 in the morning. A couple of my friends are going into the shadowy part of the cabin and I know that\\u2019s where their bed is. They just go to sleep. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to do. I go around the L-shape of the cabin to a bed that\\u2019s kind of tucked in the wall, it\\u2019s part of the design of the cabin. I lie down in one of the beds and close my eyes and go to sleep. But the guy I was flirting with, his friend, and another guy I can\\u2019t see because he\\u2019s in the stem of the L, and somebody who wasn\\u2019t there before and just arrived. I\\u2019m vaguely aware of this but I\\u2019m too tired to get up and I don\\u2019t really care and it\\u2019s 3:30. They\\u2019re all talking to each other and I can hear the low rumbling of their voices. I sleep again. Then when I wake up, I wake up to the sound of male voices and they\\u2019re chanting. The name they\\u2019re chanting is Joe. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cJoe, Joe, Joe Joe,\\u201d like a pub crawl bar room to get somebody to chug their beer. They\\u2019re saying it quietly, but it\\u2019s the feel of the chant and it\\u2019s woken me up. In that instant where I\\u2019m wondering what they\\u2019re doing I realize what they\\u2019re doing. Then I realize that I heard the guy I felt the energy with say in his subconscious: \\u201cMaybe Paige would like it.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhere did that girl come from?\\u201d Then I remember there was a younger girl in the cabin before I fell asleep. She was about 13 or 14. I\\u2019m thinking her name must be Paige. Out of the corner of my eye I realize that the other guy who also entered at about 3:30 has no pants on. Then my brain puts it together. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cMaybe Paige would like it?\\u201d And they\\u2019re chanting his name. He\\u2019s doing something to her! I get up out of the bed and I see him. He\\u2019s got one hand around the back of her head and the other one on his own cock and he\\u2019s forcing her to give him a blowjob. All this rage! I get out of the bed and am yelling at all of them: \\u201cGet off her!\\u201d I\\u2019m ready to fly at this guy. They all step back. They look shocked. I\\u2019m so angry that I woke myself up and I can\\u2019t get back to sleep. My heart is pounding. I'm furious that they\\u2019re all egging him on and standing around chanting his name.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a neighborhood with a family. Part of the family is a father-son. They\\u2019re Filipino and they\\u2019re acting like all the Filipino men I ever encountered in Hawaii who had crushes on haole women. They\\u2019re flirty and following me around. It\\u2019s been pouring rain. There\\u2019s basically a river of water on the street outside of the house. There\\u2019s a little place where somehow the water isn\\u2019t washing things away, but I can get in up to my neck. I get in with my swimsuit and the dad and his brother or son in their forties are closeby watching me. I\\u2019m swimming in this little pond - it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a hole in the ground that\\u2019s been filled and somehow it\\u2019s keeping me out of the main rushing river of water. The water is clear right here but as the rain comes and goes, it gets muddy from the rain rushing down the mountains, then it clears out again. I\\u2019m in this water. I\\u2019m comfortable in it and glad I\\u2019m there. Somehow it\\u2019s not too cold even though it\\u2019s rain water. I\\u2019m looking up the road to where the water is coming from. There\\u2019s a mountain so this river water is coming down from the mountain. I\\u2019m watching as the water goes muddy then clear. I\\u2019m getting in and out of this water. I dry off a little bit and go back in as needed. One of the times I get out and dry off, the water has gone and it\\u2019s not raining anymore. So now there isn\\u2019t a place for me to get in the water. I leave and am done here, time to move on. The whole time I was there I had a sense of these two men always flirting with me, always wanting my attention, always wanting something from me. While I was being polite to them, it was very annoying and I just wanted to be in the water and to be talked to like a normal human being not some haole girl that they have a crush on because I\\u2019m white. The scene changes. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people. This is bizarre, I have no idea who they are in real life, but in the dream I knew them from a time before, I had spent a lot of time with them before, as if I was part of their family. Now I\\u2019ve come back from wherever I was and I can\\u2019t even remember everyone\\u2019s names. It\\u2019s so strange. There\\u2019s a bigger white lady and her family and other friends and neighbors from the neighborhood that have created this community. They\\u2019re putting on a CrossFit competition. They\\u2019ve put on competitions and cookouts and other community events with all their own money in the past. It\\u2019s a way for them to keep the community together. It\\u2019s very interesting because they\\u2019ve opened their arms to me the first time I was with them and I don\\u2019t know the reason why I was there. Now I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m with them this second time. I\\u2019m just there asking them questions about how everything\\u2019s going, how they\\u2019re all doing and how the event\\u2019s going. They\\u2019re talking about how putting on this CrossFit competition has been a little more difficult because of the coronavirus. But they\\u2019re still going to do it and see it through because they\\u2019re all family and love each other. It\\u2019s a very strange sense of community but they\\u2019re not particularly intelligent. I also can\\u2019t believe I don\\u2019t remember their names. At some point I go from one of their houses to a vet\\u2019s office. Some of them are working there. I\\u2019m getting echoes of remembering what this office looked like as if I used to work there, too. This whole time part of me is wondering where Josh is because he\\u2019s my \\u201cpeople\\u201d and he\\u2019s my community and he\\u2019s not there. Then he does show up for a little bit and he\\u2019s the only name I can remember and I\\u2019m trying to introduce them and he\\u2019s gone off to talk to people. I\\u2019m still trying to get back to him. Then the dream shifts again and it gets super fantastical. I\\u2019m in a different body, a very strange round being. I\\u2019m the son or daughter of another being that looks exactly like me. We\\u2019re going to a lake. This lake is huge and swampy looking. The water is not very clean, the trees around it are dead and there\\u2019s black moss hanging from things. It\\u2019s very dreary. The sky is a greyish yellowish color. My dad, this other being, is like, \\u201cAlright, son, it\\u2019s time to go out there. Prove that you\\u2019re a man.\\u201d I get into this little round floaty and am paddling out into the lake. He has gone out before me and is like, \\u201cYou have to be very, very quiet so you don\\u2019t wake the monsters.\\u201d We\\u2019re out in the lake and he wants to show me something. We paddle out to this area where it\\u2019s clear enough for me to look down and see. He says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s the lake dog.\\u201d I look down and there\\u2019s literally a pitbull face with a thick, long body like a sausage, super fit and muscular. The butt end of it has a round circular mouth full of huge teeth that would destroy you. It\\u2019s curled up around itself on the bottom of this lake, so it\\u2019s underwater. This dog can breathe underwater. My dad, or whoever this is, says, \\u201cDon't wake it up.\\u201d But we paddle over it and we wake it up. It swims up from the bottom and gets up out of the water and starts barking and making a lot of noise. At this point, I turn to my right and am really freaked out. I\\u2019m looking to see if it\\u2019s going to wake anything up. I see in this copse of dead trees, in the branches, a huge skeleton with a head like a pterodactyl. It\\u2019s body is crazy long, maybe a hundred feet long. It has eight or nine sets of wings, all skeleton. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s the size of the monsters around here! We need to leave now and stop bothering the lake dog.\\u201d Somehow the lake dog is pacified and we start paddling back to the lakeshore.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a room gathering supplies. It\\u2019s clothing and shoes which all look the same and are necessary for a dance routine that will be performed. I\\u2019m wearing black low heeled booties and leggings and a tight top with a cowl neck. My clothing seems important because it\\u2019s part of the show I\\u2019m going to put on, or I need to wear as the teacher who is going to be teaching others the dance moves of this show we are going to put on. Then I go out from this room - I guess it\\u2019s like a costume closet - and I\\u2019m carrying all the pieces of clothing that others need. I\\u2019m walking down a hall and I walk into my old cafeteria from grade school. Everyone is there to learn this dance. I set all the clothes out and the people who need them grab what they need. I stand back and watch as an older Latina woman with dark hair tied up in a bun shows everyone the dance moves they need to know. They\\u2019re kind of jerky, like robot type, but she teaches them all. Everybody starts doing this dance synchronized together. I\\u2019m watching. I\\u2019m not part of this thing. The whole dance seems a little bit off. I look back to the pile of clothes and it\\u2019s changed into different items than I gave out. It\\u2019s a bunch of grey athletic pants and there are what I first think to be sports bras, but are women\\u2019s underwear - super strappy like 10 straps on each side where the hips would be. They remind me a lot of pole dancing shorts. The pile is a mess now - instead of being piled neatly, it\\u2019s all over the place. I look back and everybody is in fact wearing a black top and these grey athletic pants. Initially I had brought out more shoes like the ones I was wearing, but they aren\\u2019t what people actually put on. Then that completes - the teacher finishes teaching the dance and they do it. There\\u2019s never a show, but there is a sense of accomplishment like something got finished. People start filing out of this old cafeteria. It morphs a little because the area I\\u2019m standing in suddenly is a larger lobby type area and my super comfy bed is in it. I\\u2019m exhausted, so while there are a few people still milling about, I get in my bed and fall asleep. Now I have no clothes on at all and I\\u2019m trying to sleep naked. I can feel how comfortable my bed is and how tired I am. In my head, I\\u2019m thinking how grateful I am that I have a bed. I feel someone come behind me and can hear people talking, sort of murmuring. I\\u2019m not exactly clear what they\\u2019re saying. But this person snuggles up to spoon behind me and all of a sudden my body is super tense because I have no idea who that is and I\\u2019m not wearing any clothing. I continue to hear talking but I don\\u2019t know what anyone is saying. When I look down at the arm around my waist, it\\u2019s this old arm with liver spots on the hand and the skin is hanging off. I can feel the bile in my throat start to rise. Then all of a sudden, I feel the traditional Sunday morning dick in the back and I\\u2019m a little peeved. I turn around and look and it\\u2019s this old, old man. It\\u2019s him and his friend who have crawled into bed. They also just want to sleep, but they are not realizing that 1, it\\u2019s my bed, and 2, I don\\u2019t have clothes and 3, it\\u2019s so inappropriate for them to be poking me. So I turn around and I start yelling at them to get out. They\\u2019re a little embarrassed but there\\u2019s also this vibe of lecherousness. I\\u2019m so mad and I kick them out. Then I get out of bed and put my clothes on. There were actually people around watching this go down. I\\u2019m pissed. I\\u2019m so mad that they would even dare to encroach on my space or that somebody else would encourage them to do so. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m in a lobby of a Crossfit gym. A friend of mine is there and it\\u2019s the same friend from the dream two nights ago. I\\u2019m happy to see her and she\\u2019s happy to see me as well. But then she starts talking and asks me, who do I think I am to come back into her life and pretence like nothing ever happened, and for me to influence people around her to see her in a different way. And who do I think I am to think that her friends would be so forgiving of me and welcoming me back into the crowd. I\\u2019m really shocked hearing her say this, because she absolutely on one hand said she missed me and wanted to try to repair and fix the friendship, and on the other hand is completely berating me. I\\u2019m so confused and definitely hurt. I can feel myself backing away, trying to get out and away of this entire situation, taking the hint that she\\u2019s not interested and I need to leave.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a shower stall with Ana. I can\\u2019t remember if our clothes are on or off. We\\u2019re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I\\u2019m looking at her like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re just kind of winging it.\\u201d I wish I could remember more, but there\\u2019s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with my siblings. We\\u2019re all in a big house together and it\\u2019s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We\\u2019re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it\\u2019s just covered in blueberries. We\\u2019re munching on them. We\\u2019re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he\\u2019s not a very smooth driver. So I\\u2019m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he\\u2019s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it\\u2019s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We\\u2019re in a house of some sort but I don\\u2019t recognize it and I don\\u2019t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we\\u2019re all gathered for a wedding. I\\u2019m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he\\u2019s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there\\u2019s no bowl and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cHey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.\\u201d The popcorn starts popping and it\\u2019s endless. I\\u2019m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it\\u2019s going everywhere. It wouldn\\u2019t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I\\u2019m looking down and thinking you can\\u2019t even save this. He\\u2019s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, \\u201cnice way to go, dad,\\u201d and I think my dad is standing there like, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s not a good way to pop popcorn.\\u201d As he\\u2019s sweeping up the popcorn, there\\u2019s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There\\u2019s tons of it and it\\u2019s all over the floor. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what you\\u2019re going to do with all of this. You\\u2019re going to have to throw it away.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make more.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.\\u201d It feels like a waste. There was more to this dream, but I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a train station and I\\u2019m looking at the boards that announce arrivals and departures and finding my train to get on. It\\u2019s an Amtrak train. I find the train I want. I get on through a gate that reminds of an airport, the way it\\u2019s set up to get on and off. I find my gate and I get on. I take a seat and the train starts to leave. It\\u2019s just me. I have a few bags with me. I\\u2019m watching as the train leaves the station. It never really goes outside. I think the train is in a tunnel the whole time, so it seems dark. There\\u2019s multiple stops and there\\u2019s some stops I need to get off of, but then I get back on the train. I get off and then I get back on. Now I\\u2019ve gotten off at this one particular spot and my kids are with me - I think I was picking them up. We don\\u2019t get back on the train at this same stop. We all get together and we go to a friend\\u2019s house and the friend's house is tiny. It\\u2019s in a more run down part of town. We\\u2019re there and her kids are there. The kids are all playing together and we\\u2019re talking. She\\u2019s telling me about how she\\u2019s ended a couple of habits she didn\\u2019t like. She stopped doing things the way she had been doing it and now she\\u2019s cleaning her house. Things look less cluttered in her space and she clearly felt better about all of it. Then I realize it\\u2019s time for us to go. It\\u2019s time for the kids to get back on the train. Before we go, another woman shows up. It\\u2019s a different friend who reminds me of my old hula teacher. She\\u2019s giving me some advice about how to parent because my daughter is definitely talking back and is resisting us getting on the train. I lose my temper in front of everyone and my daughter gets really pissed off and stomps off. Then both my friends are telling me how I could do it differently with her. I take their advice and I grab both my kids. We leave the house and head back to get on this train. It\\u2019s so important but I have no idea where we're going and I don\\u2019t know why. The sun has set now. It\\u2019s dark and we\\u2019re walking through a part of town that looks a little bit shady and it\\u2019s like a city and I have a death grip on both my kids\\u2019 hands because I don\\u2019t want anybody to snag them. Both my kids have their luggage, but I have this feeling that something is going to happen to the kids and I\\u2019m really worried. So we\\u2019re now rushing to get on this train. I\\u2019m looking at my phone - my phone is a map showing me where the terminals are for us to get on the train. But for some reason, the map in my hand is not syncing up with where we actually are. At one point, we walk into this nightclub and it\\u2019s full dark now. I don\\u2019t know how we walk into a nightclub with two udnerage kids, but we walk in there and we\\u2019re walking towards the back, looking for the train terminal for the entrance. I still can\\u2019t find it and I walk past the bartender and a bouncer and they both tell me that there\\u2019s no train in there. In the meantime, I have both my kids and it\\u2019s definitely not a place for minors. So I have this death grip on their hands and I\\u2019m pulling them back out of the nightclub, but somehow there\\u2019s a ring on my left finger that gets caught on the necklace of the bouncer who\\u2019s trying to help us out, telling us there isn\\u2019t a station there. It takes a minute for it to get untangled, although he does help me. Then I grab my kids hands again and we\\u2019re heading up the sidewalk trying to find another train station to get on these trains. My daughter doesn\\u2019t want to go and I\\u2019m having a hard time keeping her with me, but I\\u2019m so terrified that something\\u2019s going to happen to her because it\\u2019s dark out, it\\u2019s not a good part of the city, there\\u2019s people everywhere, she\\u2019s young - she\\u2019s only 12. My son is very happy to stay close by, but she wants to go off and explore and I\\u2019m not having it. She\\u2019s still pissed at me for whatever altercation we had at the friend\\u2019s house. So eventually I find a bike. We get on the bike - somehow I manage to get all three of us on with our luggage. I figure we\\u2019ll find the train wherever it is on its rails and get on that way. We\\u2019re on the bike. We\\u2019re riding through the streets and there\\u2019s snow up to my mid-calves and the snow is slushy. We\\u2019re still riding through it on the bike but of course it\\u2019s not safe. We\\u2019re riding with a lot of cars. I don\\u2019t feel safe with the cars because they could take us out any minute. We ride down this one hill into what seems to be much more like the ghettos. There\\u2019s tank drums and somebody\\u2019s got a fire in the drum. I\\u2019ve got the kids with me and I really don\\u2019t feel safe now. I see the train is actually in front of us at this intersection. There\\u2019s also a friend I know. He and his mom are in front of us and there\\u2019s also a train parked in front of us on some tracks through the intersection. I\\u2019m really wanting us to get on this train. We never make it on. I ask the friend and his mom for help, but they kind of ignore me and I\\u2019m stuck with my two kiddos, with no way to get on the train in this part of town that does not feel safe, on a bicycle in the snow. The dream ends there.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in Hawaii by a lake, My parents and sister are nearby. I look down at the brown wet leaves at my feet. I see two snakes intertwined with each other. Then I\\u2019m shocked and worried because there aren\\u2019t supposed to be any snakes in Hawaii. I also know that Hawaii doesn\\u2019t have lakes, so I\\u2019m a bit confused, too. As I\\u2019m watching the snakes, I realize they\\u2019re mating and this is even worse because instead of just two snakes, there will be more and the island could be taken over by snakes. I look into the water and see another snake swimming in the water. As I watch, I realize it\\u2019s a huge anaconda and it\\u2019s undulating towards my mom, dad and sister. I yell at my parents and sister to warn them. I realize that I have to do something about this and find someone who can help me. Now I look at the ground again. The first two snakes are also anacondas - a lot larger than I first thought. There are also so many bathing snakes writhing around like earthworms, but they\\u2019re actually itty bitty baby snakes. I\\u2019m trying to cut them with a shovel. I can squash them with my shoes because I\\u2019m wearing flip flops and those won\\u2019t do. I\\u2019m looking for help and now realize that the snakes are a problem all over the island. I\\u2019m now at a hotel looking for more snakes and help. It\\u2019s late. I see Ted. We sit on a curb away from everyone else and have a talk before returning to our separate hotel rooms for the night.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the back of a house/laboratory and they\\u2019re showing me the pool. It\\u2019s rounded and smooth at the bottom. People are swimming in the water, breathing with eyes open and taking pictures from under the water. It\\u2019s a scientific experiment. But as they swim, they are disturbing the water and it is sloshing with water from other pools that are contaminated. In the front of the house, someone is lighting candles on the altar, so many candles all clustered together.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the kitchen of a communal home. It\\u2019s an old house. There are big books set up on the counter - they look like spell books or history books. Pema brings a bread book into the kitchen and sets it up.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the room of a house I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m there with, I think my ex, I\\u2019m not sure as the face flickers out. But I\\u2019m looking around and there\\u2019s a table, a desk, with an old stereo on it - it looks exactly like the one I had growing up in high school. It has a case and the case is not on it, so I put the case on like it\\u2019s supposed to be. There\\u2019s also a vase of flowers in the room - I don\\u2019t know if somebody gave them to me, or if they\\u2019re just there. I put them next to the bed on this tall nightstand. This whole time I feel simultaneously trapped and nostalgic. This old radio stereo makes me nostalgic for my childhood and yet I feel trapped in this room and want to get out of it, especially since it looks like my ex is in there with me. Then he says we have to go to dinner. I don\\u2019t want to because we\\u2019re not together and I have no idea why I\\u2019d go to dinner with him. But he says we have to go because we\\u2019re meeting clients of his. Now I\\u2019m really not wanting to because it\\u2019s a gross schmoozy dinner that I do not want to be a part of. He walks out the door and gets on a bike and starts pedaling through a crowd. I\\u2019ve followed him out and am watching him go. I\\u2019m really sad because I know that my legs and the muscles in my body are not as strong as they used to be and it\\u2019s going to be really hard for me to pedal that bike to follow him to this dinner party we\\u2019re going to. I can just feel how I don\\u2019t have very much strength in my legs and I used to have a lot. And it's making me really sad to know that I used to be a very strong bodied person and now I\\u2019m not. I follow him anyway on a bike. I stay behind him the whole way because I can\\u2019t keep up. We\\u2019re biking through crowds of people to get to this restaurant. I\\u2019m following along behind and he parks his bike and so do I. I see him talking to a host at the restaurant and telling him he has a table for four and I\\u2019m to follow. So I follow him to a table, but there\\u2019s enough distance between us that by the time I finally get to the table, he\\u2019s already ordered drinks and he has hor d'oeuvres coming and he\\u2019s on his second drink already. I go to sit down at the table, still very reluctant. There are other people who will join us. He has me try one of his drinks. It\\u2019s alcoholic and super sugary sweet gross, and I don\\u2019t want to taste it because I know alcohol is so bad for me - it will make me feel really badly really quickly and I hate that I\\u2019m here with him. It feels like I\\u2019m being made to perform the dutiful hostess while he performs the gross role of extravagant host. He\\u2019s ordering all the food and our guests are here now. It\\u2019s two different couples, both man and wife, female and male couples. They\\u2019ve sat down and my ex is getting loud and really arrogant and ordering the food for everyone. He\\u2019s ordering tapas for everyone but it has dairy or grain, which is all food I\\u2019m allergic to, so there's nothing for me to eat or drink. I\\u2019m trying to make small talk with these friends of his. The men are also gross and arrogant and the wives are too, but the one next to me is a little more subdued in her behavior and demeanor. She\\u2019s not loud and laughing. She\\u2019s more quiet and we are sitting next to each other. I feel a little connection with her, although at one point someone spills a cocktail all over both of us and it\\u2019s sticky and she\\u2019s laughing but I\\u2019m annoyed. Then somehow the dinner is over and the scene changes because now I'm off by myself. I\\u2019m really grateful to be by myself. I\\u2019m walking up through these hills and I can still see the restaurant I had been in, which is on a pier. I have an impression of the ocean that was part of the background of this restaurant. But now I\\u2019m walking through these smaller rolling hills - they\\u2019re all green. There are copses of trees and when I look up the hill, it\\u2019s thickly covered in forest, but I\\u2019m not in that thicker part yet. There\\u2019s a fire somewhere and now I\\u2019m following these men who are firefighters - they\\u2019re very burly, muscular and thick - cliche of a firefighter. I\\u2019m on stealth mode for some reason. I know I have to get to this fire to see what\\u2019s going on, but I don\\u2019t want to get in the way of the firefighters. So I'm following them, but being very sneaky and hiding behind some of the trees as I follow them to this road. I can hear dispatch giving them instructions to the road of how to get to the fire. I\\u2019m following along but sneaking behind everyone, though I can see everything playing out in front of me. Then I get to this place where I\\u2019m looking at the road and I can see the fire engines. It\\u2019s a dirt road, but there are houses along it. They are driving through neighborhoods, but where I\\u2019m standing, there\\u2019s a souvenir store like what you'd see at Disneyland to pick up Disneyland stuff. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what the souvenirs are, but it has that feel of a place where tourists come to spend money. I\\u2019m in this store but still watching what\\u2019s happening outside as the firefighters are heading towards this fire. All of a sudden, there is an assassination and I\\u2019m watching the person who is supposed to be doing the assassinating. I\\u2019m not entirely sure who he\\u2019s supposed to kill, but this person is an elf and has a silver bow that he\\u2019s going to do the assasination with. I\\u2019m watching him weave through the crowd and hide behind some of the displays in the shop. He finally gets his eyes on the person he\\u2019s going to assassinate. He puts his silver bow down next to him and it starts sliding away. All of a sudden the aisles in this store mimic the hills I\\u2019ve been walking on. This bow starts to slide away from him and somebody notices it and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you\\u2019re going to kill your target if your bow is sliding away.\\u201d He looks up and realizes that somebody else has been tracking him as he\\u2019s been tracking his target, and I\\u2019ve been watching all of this go on. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a commotion outside the store. The woman who had been sitting next to me at dinner is being attacked by someone - whether it is the assassin's target or not, I\\u2019m not sure, but I see her pulled behind the side of the building and then there\\u2019s screaming. I\\u2019m really worried at this point because it doesn\\u2019t seem like anyone is going to stop them, except maybe this assassin in front of me with his bow sliding away down the hill. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m looking down at a pool or lake. My son is in the middle of it, floating with his head up out of the water. I panic a little because I\\u2019m not sure how long he can keep swimming by himself and I\\u2019m quite far away. As I watch he starts to swim to the far side of the lake to where waves are crashing against the shore. He gets caught in the waves and his body is being thrown around. I rush to him. I\\u2019m not sure if I get to him in time.\"],[\"I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s about Coronavirus, but the huge concerns for my family and my loving dog which I hope they are with me in contry area, i wake up thought I\\u2019m with them. I miss my city and family a lot.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a piece of property with two houses. There\\u2019s a main house and a secondary building that is smaller and looks like a single-wide, slanted with one side taller than the other. The taller side of this building is all sliding glass windows and you can see into it. The land has eucalyptus trees and a mango tree. It looks kind of tropical but also like California, desert with a lot of oak trees. I\\u2019m with my family - my dad, mom and siblings - and other people who I don\\u2019t recognize, but have the sense they are ancestors. It\\u2019s a gathering. The focus is on this little house with all the sliding doors and glass windows. I can see into it and there are Persian rugs all over and couches. The other house is a grand house that\\u2019s very well appointed, while this house is more humble with a small kitchen off to the left and a bath. I don\\u2019t see any beds, but my dad is telling me that he and friends have stayed there and really liked sleeping there. I can see a fireplace. But I have no idea where they sleep. I see a dining room table and chairs and a couple couches, but again, no beds. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere are you all sleeping? There are no beds and no place to sleep.\\u201d This house is definitely a focus for the moment. Parts of it need fixing up. It doesn\\u2019t have plumbing and they\\u2019re planning on putting plumbing in it. Me and my dad and at least a few other people are gathered around the house and looking at it and talking about it. Then, the scene changes. I\\u2019m with somebody who looks like a young Keanu Reeves and he\\u2019s hurt. He had some sort of accident and is learning to walk again. I\\u2019m watching him getting rehab in the pool with his mom and sister - I have no idea if he has a mom and sister in real life. I\\u2019m watching them encourage him to do his pool exercises of swimming and water jogging so that he regains the full use of his body and legs. He does. At first he starts out really bitter and sullen, but then his demeanor changes as he spends time in the pool. I\\u2019m in the pool with them and I can see him do his exercises. They\\u2019re at one end of the pool and he\\u2019s swimming back and forth to the wall. He reminds me of my brother, too - it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s switching back and forth. He regains full use of his body and gets out of the pool. Then the Rock shows up. I\\u2019m following along with all of this, but can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m actually in the dream or just observing. They climb into a helicopter. There\\u2019s one other person who shows up, but I can\\u2019t remember who it is, although it\\u2019s some movie star. They climb into the helicopter and I\\u2019m afraid that the helicopter isn\\u2019t balanced and if we all get in, it\\u2019s going to tip backwards and fall off the ledge it\\u2019s perched on. The helicopter is all black on the outside. There\\u2019s also a dog. The Rock is the pilot. Keanu Reeves is in the helicopter and ready for an action adventure mission. Then the third person has also climbed in. My fear is that they\\u2019re going to tip over backwards because the helicopter is sitting on a ledge - it\\u2019s not on a super stable helipad. I\\u2019ve followed them into the cockpit but don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m really there because I don\\u2019t have a place to sit and no one is addressing me. They\\u2019re all healthy and ready to go. I\\u2019m hearing mission kind of music playing in my head, so it\\u2019s really like a movie. They\\u2019re going to take off. I think I go with them, but I can\\u2019t remember. Below us is a bunch of water - it\\u2019s like a cliff face with rocks and ocean down below.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a quest and there are a lot of different characters on this quest. I am being escorted by my dad. He\\u2019s the male figure who is with me. There\\u2019s also another part of the party - a child, a younger person, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is. We\\u2019re headed out into what looks like a rather desolate lava field. But before we go, I am with a gypsy woman. I have met with this gypsy woman and we are in her caravan. It\\u2019s a cross between an old fashioned caravan drawn by a pair of horses but also an RV. It\\u2019s awesome. On the inside, it\\u2019s set up the way an RV is set up - you can see through the front windows where the driver\\u2019s seat is, but it\\u2019s still very witchy on the inside. This gypsy woman travels around but doesn\\u2019t necessarily look like a regular gypsy with scarves and whatnot. She is dressed in long robes and has longer hair. She has jewelry and there\\u2019s something about the jewelry - it\\u2019s earrings. I\\u2019m on a quest, but there\\u2019s two, so the first one I go on, I have a particular pair of earrings I pick out from her and I wear them. They\\u2019re a talisman of some sort. They are either protective or hold magic powers that enhance my own. I\\u2019m not entirely sure. I wear these out on this quest and I go out. I don\\u2019t remember the details of it, but I come back into the van. It\\u2019s time for me to continue on the quest, but it\\u2019s a level up now. I\\u2019ve realized this time around that the earrings are really important and I need a good pair for what I\\u2019m going to do. I\\u2019m going through what she has and there\\u2019s this pair that is just stunning. One earring is pearls with long chains and other gems on the bottom. The other earring that\\u2019s part of this pair is a huge chandelier earring which reaches past my breast. It\\u2019s really long. I put them both on and I can feel myself all of a sudden level up, like you would in a video game. She is trying to tell me what the different properties of these earrings are based on the different stones and what\\u2019s in them and what they will allow me to do. So my dad or whoever it - the male figure - is in the background, he\\u2019s still with me. He just is kind of there - he was just kind of there on the first quest and he\\u2019s just kind of there on the second quest. He does make a few suggestions about how to go about doing things, but he\\u2019s definitely taking a backseat. This is all up to me. The gypsy woman and I are conversing about the powers of the earrings, but also my own magical powers that will help me out during this section part of the quest. Then the scene changes from this questing to me being in what seems like a village. It kind of reminds me of the villages you visit in Disneyland. They\\u2019re a little bit fake but they\\u2019re kind of neat because there\\u2019s cool stuff in them. This village is smallish and there is an appearance of all my high school classmates and other people I don't know who are just filling in the spaces. I\\u2019m watching as one of my high school friends - someone who\\u2019s in an older class is building a structure out of logs. It\\u2019s an art piece in the center of the town. The rest of us are coming to gather around. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going and I see him build this. I leave and I go do something else. The structure is up and I see people come and have little meetings around this structure. I\\u2019m in a pool and it\\u2019s an indoor pool entirely enclosed in glass. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m there watching people come and go. There\\u2019s meetings happening. My mom has shown up and I hear her having a meeting with some of my classmates. This is very interesting because one of my classmates is having a tantrum and he\\u2019s screaming and crying just like a little kid would. I can't even see him, but I know who it is by his voice. But I don\\u2019t know what my mom is saying and I don\\u2019t know what the meeting is about. In some way she is this boss or it feels like she\\u2019s some sort of crime lord and my classmates are coming and going and doing her bidding, essentially. I\\u2019m shocked to hear my classmate screaming and crying because it seems like such childish behavior. But my mom is not phased by it at all. I can\\u2019t actually see any of this. I can only hear it and feel what\\u2019s going on. I do not have vision of what this is - they are not in my eyesight. I\\u2019m still in this pool/atrium place and their meeting is somewhere above me - like there\\u2019s rooms upstairs above me. I\\u2019ve stepped out of the atrium and it\\u2019s towards my back. Another classmate has her coffee in hand. It looks like she\\u2019s just woken up and she's in her pajamas. She stomps towards that art piece that the other classmate had made and she just pulls the logs down, yelling. I don\\u2019t even know what she\\u2019s yelling about, but she\\u2019s making the assumption that one of our classmates had made the artpiece. When we tell her that it was actually an upperclassman, she gets a little bit freaked out, but it\\u2019s too late. She can\\u2019t fix the sculpture. It\\u2019s already been pulled down. Throughout this whole time, I am part of this scene - I am part of the village, I am part of what's going on, but I\\u2019m also not. I\\u2019m also the observer and again the outcast, not really included, but also supposed to observe what's going on. Then my alarm went off, so I don\\u2019t remember the rest of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a raft with Mia in the middle of an ocean. Mia made the raft. Part of it is made of plastic buckets tied tightly together. The other part is made of logs also tied tightly together with ropes. There\\u2019s a gap between these two parts. Mia and I are on the logs. The ocean is pretty choppy. My husband is nearby on a surfboard. Every now and again a huge shark goes by and it\\u2019s making me feel unsettled and frightened. A huge shark goes right under our raft and makes the waves even choppier right around us. Then another huge shark goes right over our raft and slips between the gap between the buckets and logs. I see that it\\u2019s bloodied and has a rope tied tightly around its fins. Mia doesn\\u2019t seem concerned because even though these sharks are huge, they won\\u2019t directly attack us. But then we are actually under attack. Great Whites spot us. Mia says, \\u201cOkay Viviane, we\\u2019ve gotta dive.\\u201d So we lay flat on our stomachs and make the raft plunge down under the waves as you would do with a surfboard. We plunge away from the shark and miss it. But as we rise up, the tip of our raft knocks the underbelly of a huge hammerhead shark. We have to dive again before surfacing and continue diving deep. I hope we don\\u2019t run out of air and I hope this tactic protects us from the sharks. My husband is doing the same thing on his surfboard. Somehow we all make it safely out of the water to the station. The station is where they provide gear and simple food and coffee/tea. They also collect stories from people\\u2019s time out in the water. A guy is telling us this. Mia begins explaining our story. My husband chimes in, too.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a ship, a huge cruise ship. There are tons of people on it. There's water everywhere. I\\u2019m with a bunch of friends, some from high school and some from now. I see one friend from high school who I haven\\u2019t seen or thought about in a while. He is sitting across this really big table from me. All of a sudden I see him lift his hand and I can feel this force coming from his hand and he\\u2019s pushing against me. This whole time we were talking about some of things I can do, and he said, \\u201cOh yeah, watch this. Can you do this?\\u201d I feel a force or pressure from his hand as if someone is pushing on me. It\\u2019s not malicious or anything; he\\u2019s just trying to show me what he can do. I\\u2019m shocked because I can\\u2019t do it and I feel a little embarrassed that I should be able to do this but I can\\u2019t. Then he goes: \\u201cOkay now, watch this.\\u201d There\\u2019s a billboard that comes up across and squares and diamonds start appearing at the top and he\\u2019s making this happen. In the dream, I have this recognition that I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and he went somewhere then came back and can do all this cool stuff. Then the dream shifts. We\\u2019re on land now. I\\u2019m trying to do a dance with friends - I\\u2019m supposed to be learning this dance. I just can\\u2019t learn it. I\\u2019m behind on my timing. I keep looking out of the corner of my eye to this woman to watch her. My friends Shiena and Teresa who I knew from middle school and high school are there. I think I\\u2019m trying to watch and follow them. My friend Josh is watching me and I feel embarrassed that he\\u2019s watching me and I can\\u2019t get the dance moves. I\\u2019m on big loose rocks and I\\u2019m having a hard time balancing. I feel like he\\u2019s judging me for not being able to balance and not being able to get the dance moves down. Then the scene switches. In the back of my mind I know that there is a mission we\\u2019re going on. We\\u2019re still on land. We\\u2019re sitting on a huge fallen log. We\\u2019re all getting our assignments for what we\\u2019re supposed to do. We\\u2019re each getting assigned a bag to carry. These bags have supplies and whatnot. I\\u2019m watching the person in charge. They have a big clipboard and they\\u2019re assigning some of the newbies (people I don't know at all) sleeping gear. One of the bags has a sleeping bag in it, but they\\u2019ve also put rocks in it to make it extra heavy. Everyone is giggling and laughing because it\\u2019s a joke. I think I\\u2019m supposed to play along with this joke and laugh hahaha, but I don\\u2019t. There is a sense of peer pressure that I need to laugh about it. I\\u2019m a little confused about this whole thing. I\\u2019m not even sure where we\\u2019re supposed to be going. At one point my mom shows up and says, \\u201cOkay, you\\u2019re on this mission and you've got to do these things.\\u201d Other people are telling me all these things I\\u2019m supposed to be doing as my role in this mission. I feel unprepared and don\\u2019t have the skills that other people can do.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a winding road with my mom and others. We have artwork in the car that we\\u2019re carrying with us as we look for land. We find the land owned by a woman who collects art. We bring down one piece from my mom. The land is huge with big statues and canvases stacked everywhere and leaning against old buildings. There are impressions on the ground where other statues used to be. We think maybe she has decided to move and is selling her art. We wonder if this is a place for us to live. We go to the house. It\\u2019s an old barnhouse. We knock on the door and no one answers so we knock louder. She comes to the door and is wrapped in this white cream robe. Her hair is frizzy. She\\u2019s curious about my mom\\u2019s art piece but turns to me and asks about mine. I say, \\u201cWell I have something I was taking to the dump.\\u201d I run back up the hill to the car and get it. It\\u2019s an old antique picture of a blue heron with an upcycled frame with nails and staples. It\\u2019s bigger than me. This is what she wants. She takes it and leans it against the barn wall. It occurs to us that she\\u2019s staying here and people have just recently been here to buy some of her larger pieces of art.\"],[\"I\\u2019m out on the ocean on a raft or a floating device of some sort. I\\u2019m with this man who is an actor in a show called \\u201cThe Great\\u201d and he plays the Emperor Peter III of Russia and he\\u2019s nutty in the show. The character he plays is tyrannical and pretty uneven. I\\u2019m with him and other people. We\\u2019re floating and there\\u2019s a toy on top of the raft with us, too. It\\u2019s a little wooden truck with blocks in it and the blocks have numbers and the ABC\\u2019s on all their sides. I\\u2019m trying to keep the toy from falling inthe water and disappearing. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing or saying, I just know we\\u2019re riding waves. It seems as if this guy, the actor, is a little bit crazy. I\\u2019m trying my best to placate him and do what\\u2019s needed to keep us from drowning and keep the toy from falling off. In my mind I know this toy is a rental, I\\u2019ve borrowed it and have to give it back. We head back to land, catching waves on this raft. The toy gets lost at some point, it falls off into the ocean. The guy says, \\u201cOh no, you\\u2019ve lost your toy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, but we have to turn it back in because it\\u2019s a rental.\\u201d He tries to help me find it. We find a bunch of toys but it\\u2019s not the one we had. Eventually we do find it and I turn it into this woman. The dream switches. I\\u2019m with all the ladies I have council with. We\\u2019re at a home, I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s home it is. There are a bunch of cars on the lawn next to us and in the driveway of the home that we\\u2019re in. there seems to be cars everywhere, like maybe there\\u2019s a party next door. There are a bunch of cars that are our cars, too. If you go inside the house, it\\u2019s dark and dingy. A tv is playing and the furniture is gross. But we\\u2019re outside mostly on a picnic table. We\\u2019re planting plants into pots, at least I think that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re there to do. We\\u2019re there to make wreaths and plant plants. One of the sisters, Beth, comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019re going to do this but first we have to do our makeup.\\u201d It turns into a makeover situation and she has eyeliner and eyeshadow and I think eyelashes. She keeps handing them to Aila, who is in council with us. Aila is the one putting eyeliner on me and it\\u2019s a forest green color. Beth keeps saying, \\u201cTrust me, you\\u2019re going to look gorgeous.\\u201d And Aila is like, \\u201cYup, I\\u2019ve got this.\\u201d She\\u2019s putting it on but I can\\u2019t see and there\\u2019s no mirror so I\\u2019m just trusting them. Aila goes to put on the fake eyelashes and she puts one on right over the bridge of my nose like a joke. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s supposed to be there.\\u201d Everyone is kind of laughing. There are other ladies who are part of the group but not necessarily part of council and they have this bright shimmery turquoise blue eyeshadow on because they were getting their makeup done, too. Somebody says they\\u2019re hungry. I go to make a phone call to order pizza. I\\u2019ve ordered pizza before at other gatherings so that\\u2019s why I volunteer. The pizza guy comes and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you know this but because you\\u2019re new, you get ten free pizzas. So this is your second pizza and you can order eight more pizzas.\\u201d I\\u2019m surprised because I don\\u2019t eat pizza and I'm also surprised that a pizza place would give away pizza for free and that they would drive it out to us. I thank him and take the pizza for everyone to eat. I\\u2019m not going to eat it though because I don\\u2019t eat pizza. It\\u2019s weird. In the meantime, the house next door gets more and more cars parked on its lawn and there are more and more people partying over there. It seems kind of loud. I\\u2019m a little bit trying to distance myself from next door and go inside with this pizza. Inside is still so dingy and gross and I don\\u2019t really want to be in there. Someone says, \\u201cHey look at this.\\u201d She shows me this instagram post where my daughter is doing a video and I\\u2019m horrified because she\\u2019s young and I don\\u2019t want her to have social media. She\\u2019s asking for money and is becoming a little business person on instagram. It\\u2019s a family friend who is a little erratic and is coaching her in how to do it. I\\u2019m freaked out. I start to think that my daughter is doing something that is not age appropriate but she doesn\\u2019t have any idea in her head that she can\\u2019t make money because she\\u2019s a girl or she\\u2019s young or she doesn\\u2019t have an education. She\\u2019s just doing it and making the money.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outside a yoga studio in a common room. I\\u2019m looking through windows. It\\u2019s dark inside the studio. I\\u2019m talking with a yoga teacher I know about how the studio has closed and won't be offering classes again. They are selling everything. She is talking with me about teaching for her. But then I see her talking with a man who is a new yoga teacher but has been in the fitness world for a long time. I don\\u2019t recognize him. She\\u2019s wanting him to pick up some classes, too. I\\u2019m not happy about this. There are tall fake trees in the studio and these are for sale, too, because they have to sell everything.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outside. It\\u2019s twilight. There\\u2019s a gathering of some sort. We\\u2019re going to put on an outdoor show and we need a stage pole. It\\u2019s me and a bunch of others, I\\u2019m not sure who. We\\u2019re trying to put the stage pole together. It\\u2019s like a telescope with a thin end and opens up and out. The pole is like that but reversed - the base is thick and it gets skinnier at the top. It\\u2019s black and made of plastic. I\\u2019m thinking that there\\u2019s no way any of us will be able to pole on this thing. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense. A bunch of us are trying to figure out how to make this work. I think I can hear the ocean somewhere because I can hear waves. The show is for someone, but I don't know who. We\\u2019re having such a difficult time setting up the stage and pole. The pole is so flimsy.\"],[\"I\\u2019m part of a TV show that goes to people\\u2019s homes and surprises them and cleans their cars or helps them out with their food trucks. We are going to this house that we\\u2019ve been to before. It\\u2019s an old African American couple. He is at the food truck cooking the sausage. He\\u2019s really happy to see us. He and his wife have gotten really busy since we were last there. He is nearly done with his shift and we stay outside to surprise her. He goes inside the house and she is cleaning up the house. I\\u2019m standing in the doorway and she sees me and is like, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re the girl from the food show!\\u201d She\\u2019s happy to see us. We need to move things around in the house and clean up and reorganize because we\\u2019ve hired a group of people to professionally clean and paint the trucks to get them ready. They\\u2019re going to pull the truck in through the garage and into the living room. We\\u2019re moving things around, reorganizing the little tables. Then I go outside and the cleaning people come in their van. A woman gets out and she is in a black and tan bikini. She\\u2019s wet, cold and miserable. We\\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the work into the sun so she isn\\u2019t in the cold shade. Then I get them set up and go to the garage. There\\u2019s a big shiny black fancy RV driven by ninjas. A ninja is swinging from a trapeze bar in the trees. It\\u2019s an advertisement to invite people to a tea tasting. I want to try. I jump on the trapeze bar and am swinging. It\\u2019s quite frightening. At first I\\u2019m just swinging back and forth and then I start doing more - when I swing forward I pike my body and touch my toes to the bar and do that a few times, making sure I don\\u2019t lose my grip. Then I work on the next stage of swinging my legs back and pushing myself up on the bar with my hands. I don\\u2019t quite get it. Then the dream dissolves and I\\u2019m now in an RV with Rose and a girl I knew from church in middle school. We are driving to a professor\\u2019s house at Stanford. The professor lives on Lake Lag, which is not really a lake because it\\u2019s drained most of the year. We pull the RV into the driveway and the girl from church gets out because she\\u2019s been here before. We follow her to a wooden gate. We\\u2019re looking for a way through so we can do some landscaping and cleaning of the yard. She finds a way through a small opening so we don\\u2019t have to climb over the fence. The professor who lives in the house comes out and is really surprised to see us, but he recognizes her so it\\u2019s okay. He gives me a cursory glance and then goes into the RV to look at it. He\\u2019s talking to her about her family. He has old video tapes in the front two pockets of his button down shirt. He says he must go because he has all this money in the games and must go play. He comments on Rose\\u2019s body and beauty, but says nothing about me. I think I need to change the way I dress because I\\u2019m wearing clothes that are too tight and used to fit me when I was 10-15 lbs lighter. Then we\\u2019re at a dinner party with multiple tables. It\\u2019s nighttime. There are couples. They don\\u2019t sit me next to my husband even though we\\u2019ve been doing well. I\\u2019m not happy to be sitting by myself at the end of the table. I feel awkward and have nothing to say, even though it\\u2019s really important to have something of interest to say at this party.\"],[\"I\\u2019m participating at a dance/yoga retreat at Esalen - again, this is my dream version of Esalen rather than the waking life one. There is a tantra retreat happening at the same time. The living accommodations are all quite disappointing and dilapidated. The mattress is old, flat, sagging and overused with broken springs and mold. The paint is peeling on the windowsill and the whole place feels like it\\u2019s falling apart. The shared bathroom is absolutely disgusting. The floors are wet with pee, the toilet paper is soggy from the humidity in the air. The people in the other workshop have left these grey innertube style structures over the bathtubs and toilets - the toilets look like big chairs. There\\u2019s nothing I can do about it because the other people were supposed to take care of their stuff. In another scene, I\\u2019m getting dressed with a group of women. Ella (from my priestess studies) is looking through my closet to help me choose an outfit to go to the dance club. She wants to find a floral drape she gave me years ago, but doesn\\u2019t know I got rid of it. She chooses a floral top for herself. I tell her it won\\u2019t fit her and she holds it against her body, and it\\u2019s clear to all of us except her that it\\u2019s too small. She thinks I\\u2019m being selfish rather than honest. My outfit is denim shorts with layered and fitted floral tops and a long necklace with a clear crystal at the end. The necklace hangs down between my thighs and I find it just very odd and uncomfortable. There\\u2019s another scene where I\\u2019m waiting at a studio to take yoga or dance. The schedule is really unorganized.\"],[\"I\\u2019m riding on a horse with a group of others. A woman and a young girl of about six or seven are riding on a horse together. The horses make a sharp turn and the woman and girl fall of their horse. The girl gets up on her own and seems fine. The woman needs more help.\"],[\"I\\u2019m simply at the job that I waitressed at for university. I liked working at the restaurant - it had good management and the team I worked with were excellent, but in the dream it is different. My section has about fourteen tables in it. The hostess continually seats people one after another in my section. As soon as I take a drink order from one table, she seats someone else. When I go to fulfill the drink order, there\\u2019s four more, and my section keeps expanding. So instead of ending at eight tables, there\\u2019s four more that I didn\\u2019t know about. I try to talk to her about this and tell her other servers need tables in theirs and ask her why she keeps seating me. The hostess stand is now miles and miles away from my section which is now miles and miles wide. People are angry with me. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my drink? We\\u2019ve been sitting here too long.\\u201d I go back to get napkins and somebody\\u2019s spilled grape juice and it\\u2019s permeated every single white napkin. Everywhere I go to get more napkins there\\u2019s either coffee on it or something else. There\\u2019s no cutlery and it just goes on and on like that.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at a kitchen table with my ex-father-in-law. I\\u2019m in a big house. There are windows behind him. I can see out to rolling grasslands, what I imagine the flyover states would look like with fields of corn. He and I are negotiating the house - essentially living arrangements and the mortgage. The house is the one my ex and I owned together with my ex\\u2019s dad as our mortgage holder. My ex is not at the kitchen table, and not even in the picture. It\\u2019s just me and my ex-father-in-law talking. Initially, he\\u2019s just a total dick about it and threatening to foreclose and all that. I say to him, \\u201cYou can do that, but I don\\u2019t have a place to go if you do.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law says, \\u201cYes, well my son already has a home and all the things he needs and he has the kids.\\u201d I look at him like, \\u201cWow. Amazing that you have zero compassion.\\u201d Then something shifts. I don\\u2019t know if I say something to him that makes him reconsider or he just reconsiders. He says, \\u201cOkay, here\\u2019s what I\\u2019m willing to do. Sell this house, then go buy a smaller house. Whatever money you need to buy the smaller house will be there for you.\\u201d So, I leave this house where we are. My ex-father-in-law makes some suggestions. He says, \\u201cThere are a few houses down the road a little way in this little neighborhood that might suit you. It\\u2019s small and cute and you might like it, so go look.\\u201d I leave this kitchen table and the bigger house. I walk down the road. The rolling fields change and the scenery changes to a neighborhood with the houses quite close together. It is an established neighborhood that has been there for a while because all the trees and plants are so luscious and green. It\\u2019s definitely spring or summer because everything is leafed out and there are flowers everywhere and vines growing on houses. It is gorgeous and very alive with plant life. Instead of the ticky tacky style developed neighborhoods, it actually has quite a bit of charm. The houses were built individually with their own quirks and layouts. The house that I\\u2019m looking at is yellow, two-story, smaller. There is greenery everywhere. There is a road above and below, and a set of stairs that go down to the house. I\\u2019m on the stairs, walking down to the house, and I see there is a house at the top of the stairs. These stairs are super rickety and it looks like they\\u2019re held up by vines - not like cement stairs poured into the land, but wooden stairs that are somewhat free-hanging so they sway a bit like a bridge. On my way down these stairs and there are two infants who can barely crawl. They are tiny and they\\u2019re twins. One is falling down the stairs from this house at the top of the stairs. I\\u2019m fucking horrified! There is space between each step. The babies aren\\u2019t even old enough to crawl. One is actually still sitting in its carrier, not moving too much. But the other has sort of crawled out and is trying to head down these stairs, but essentially falling. I\\u2019m horrified that it will fall to its death. I pick up the one baby that\\u2019s falling. I look around for its parent. Its dad is sitting on the porch of the house at the top of the stairs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHello? Is this your baby? It\\u2019s falling to its death.\\u201d As I'm talking to him, a pair of younger women, I think they might be in their mid or late twenties, walk by me on the stairs. It\\u2019s interesting because the stairs are not particularly wide, so it\\u2019s hard to get by. They don\\u2019t really get by. They stop and say, \\u201cOh, these babies are his and he doesn\\u2019t take good care of them. You should take them. We\\u2019ll help you. We need to find their mother or a safe place for them.\\u201d I gather both babies up. The one that was falling shudders and relaxes as soon as I pick it up and hold it. You can tell the baby was so scared. This part of the dream ends with us going out to find somebody or the mother. As we head down the stairs, we go past this yellow house I was looking at. It\\u2019s even cuter close up and I think, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s where I want to live.\\u201d Then the dream switches and I\\u2019m with my ex-husband. We are in some sort of trial separation period. He\\u2019s gone off to live with this guy and I know he\\u2019s sleeping with this guy and that they have a thing going. My ex is trying to hide it from me, though, and I think it\\u2019s hilarious. I just wait for him to come out and tell me what\\u2019s going on. My ex still has my kids. I\\u2019m horrified because he keeps pawning the kids off to other people - the kids\\u2019 friends\\u2019 houses. I can tell our kids feel unanchored and untethered. But for some reason they don\\u2019t want to see me or aren\\u2019t allowed to see me. I get the sense that they don\\u2019t want to live with me and that\\u2019s part of the issue. They want to live with their dad because he doesn\\u2019t actually have rules and boundaries for them. So, at one point, I barely see my daughter and she gives me a nasty look. Then I see my son and he\\u2019s happy to see me, but he\\u2019s very preoccupied with friends and he\\u2019s riding his bike to their house. I ask my ex if it\\u2019s safe: \\u201cDo you know where the kids are? Do you know what they\\u2019re doing all the time? Can you get a hold of them if you need to? Do you have their phone numbers?\\u201d He\\u2019s very vague about it because he\\u2019s super-preoccupied with this man and this new partnership. We\\u2019re not completely separated in this dream. We aren\\u2019t living together, but my ex\\u2019s stuff is still in our bedroom - he still needs to clear his stuff out. I meet up with him somewhere at a park. He\\u2019s on a bicycle. There\\u2019s a white Range Rover parked on the side of the street. My ex says, \\u201cI want you to meet this guy.\\u201d I assume it\\u2019s the guy he has been sleeping with. I go to meet him and it\\u2019s someone I know from high school, Jon - a shorter Asian guy. I'm like, \\u201cOh my gosh! Hi, Jon. How are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m happy to see him. It\\u2019s been a while. He\\u2019s all weird and squirrely and so is my ex. They\\u2019re still trying to hide it from me. I\\u2019m having fun at this point, making it more awkward, because they\\u2019re being so silly about it. Then my ex comes back with me to the house because now he\\u2019s finally ready to get all his stuff out of the house. We\\u2019re lying in bed. We\\u2019re both like, \\u201cHow about one last screw to really make sure we\\u2019re really done?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like: \\u201cWell, at one point are you going to admit that you like both men and women?\\u201d For some reason it\\u2019s important for me to have him know that I knew all along. He finally admits it to me, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I knew this the whole time. Thanks for saying it. Okay, now let\\u2019s both have one last orgasm. Then get your shit and get out of the bedroom.\\u201d The dream ends there.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at a round table. There are other round tables pressed up around me with small groups of people. We\\u2019re at a restaurant. There are plates of mostly eaten food, spaghetti and such - basic American restaurant food. People are singing at the front. Each table begins to sing one at a time except for mine. Then next to me is a table with my friends, George and Kayla. George starts to speak like an African American preacher and says it like it is. They\\u2019re on their way to a conference or retreat. Then one of my past yoga teachers comes by my table and says something about the music and the retreat she lead and how every spot was full even though it was COVID, people needed retreat.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at the table with my bodywork teacher and people who are new to his work and paying for continuing education. He invites me to stay, listen and learn again anything I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in line for the restroom. It\\u2019s a long line that\\u2019s not moving. I have to change for an event. My son and husband are waiting for me. It\\u2019s getting really late and it seems like I\\u2019ve been standing in line for a really long time. The line extends outside the bathroom doors and finally moves enough that I\\u2019m standing just inside. There are so many stalls and a few have open doors. When I peek in, I see women hovering their hands over the water, trying to cover what\\u2019s inside while waiting for the toilet to flush. I realize it\\u2019s taking so long because the toilets aren\\u2019t flushing properly. I step into a stall and squat and pee really fast then step out. A little while later, a woman goes into this stall and she\\u2019s disgusted because the seat is all wet. She steps out to get a towel to clean it up. I\\u2019m a bit ashamed, but I don\\u2019t think she knows I was the last person in that stall, and I also think it\\u2019s not pee, but rather splashback from a strong flush. Then we see another row of stalls - but it\\u2019s only changing rooms. Then somehow another row of stalls opens up and these have toilets. I\\u2019m trying to dressed for the event and realize it\\u2019s 11:30pm and my son is still awake! I give up trying to change because it\\u2019s just not working. I go find my family. They\\u2019re just playing, talking to people, laughing and having a good time. I\\u2019m surprised and think it\\u2019s maybe not as late as I thought it was. It\\u2019s only 6pm and we still have time to get my son home for bed. I\\u2019m relieved to see that my husband isn\\u2019t annoyed with me for taking so long. He seems understanding. The valet brings our car up. We get in the car to go to the house. The house is big, like the the ashram we visited recently in waking life. The people who live there aren\\u2019t around. We see a puppy in a big cage out front. The puppy is so cute - running around and happy. My son is especially excited to see it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of \\u201chouse,\\u201d but I can\\u2019t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we\\u2019re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can\\u2019t live on Gaia anymore and it\\u2019s not worth the effort to try to save her. She\\u2019s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing outside Roble Dance Hall at Stanford - the space where I danced in college. I\\u2019m standing in line with other dancers. We\\u2019re all the age we are now and many of us are not in the same dancing shape we were in college. I\\u2019m talking with Katie McGee who was at the time getting her a PhD in Psychology while I was undergrad. Now she\\u2019s becoming more known in the field of self improvement, psychology and stress. We\\u2019re talking about our time as dancers and I\\u2019m asking her if she ever comes back and takes classes. She answers, \\u201cOccasionally.\\u201d Then we go in and it\\u2019s like it always was - a big open space with tall windows and curtains from floor to ceiling. It brings back a lot of good memories. There\\u2019s a baker who has set up a little stand. She is a famous baker (though I don\\u2019t know about her in waking life). She\\u2019s known for her scones. I stand in line and see this delicious cake. I order a slice and am thinking of what to get for my son. I want something that\\u2019s not very sweet. I\\u2019m trying to tell her that I want the least sweet thing she has. She can\\u2019t hear me because there\\u2019s a lot of construction sounds in the background. I end up yelling, \\u201cLeast sweet! Least sweet! The not sweet one.\\u201d She finally understands me. She\\u2019s looking down at me from a platform and says, \\u201cWell, everything is sweet here.\\u201d Then she pulls a chunk of brown bread of the wall and gives it to me. She also gives me brown bread for me, too, so I don\\u2019t get the piece of pie I thought I ordered. I thank her and nipple on it. People have cleared out of the space now. There\\u2019s a threat - like a terrorist. But I\\u2019m not concerned yet. I see an empty Valentine\\u2019s Day card and write on it. It\\u2019s a lacy card that goes in a sheer lacy bag. I write a love note to the baker telling her how much I love her baked goods. Now the threat is real. Everyone scatters. The lights are turned off. I somehow am able to get out and we\\u2019re no longer on the Stanford campus. We\\u2019re at a restaurant by a lake and being served food. We hear gunshots and I learn that somebody is bleeding inside. But I\\u2019m safe for now. Then time passes. It seems like it\\u2019s finally safe to go. Then as I\\u2019m getting ready to go, I realize I\\u2019m not wearing any underwear or a bra, only a robe. I need to get a bunch of stuff together quickly and find a drawer with lingerie. I have a choice of 2 black bras - 1 plain and 1 lace - and I\\u2019m trying to decide what to bring. I choose one and some underwear and am now feeling more securely dressed. Then we\\u2019re off and I don\\u2019t recall the journey. Now I\\u2019ve been seated at a fine dining restaurant and am being poured a glass of champagne.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying at a big house. I\\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment with a woman who reminds me of Geri (a friend who worked for Burning Man and who I camped with a couple times) for 11am the next day. There are a lot of people here. I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It\\u2019s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn\\u2019t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I\\u2019m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She\\u2019s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can\\u2019t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I\\u2019m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I\\u2019m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren\\u2019t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day\\u2019s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I\\u2019m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I\\u2019m waiting at the couches - I\\u2019ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I\\u2019m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it\\u2019s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I\\u2019m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I\\u2019m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I\\u2019m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn\\u2019t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don\\u2019t want to do it anymore and I\\u2019m not going to come back. She says, \\u201cWell, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle. This is not something you give up so quickly.\\u201d I doubt myself and wonder if this is a good idea even though it doesn\\u2019t feel right or fitting. I agree to come back one more time to give it another chance.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying in a suite that has a double door that can be closed or opened into another suite. Mine is the smaller one. The place next to me is more spacious and light with better air circulation and warmth. I\\u2019ve been sneaking next door to use their space to give healing sessions. I think I\\u2019ve been doing this unnoticed because I sneak in while they\\u2019re asleep upstairs. One early morning, the man wakes earlier than usual. He comes down and catches me. He tells me that I should leave and now that I\\u2019ve been caught I better not return because he knows I\\u2019ve been sneaking around and has sensed my presence there. He suggests that I don\\u2019t press my luck any longer and don\\u2019t use other people\\u2019s property in this way without permission.\"],[\"I\\u2019m struggling to recall everything but I have these intense memories of being with a group of people and bonding intensely because we had to and meeting in an apartment in a dark apartment somewhere. I don\\u2019t know if I was me but then we all got into this train together and someone else had to drive it. This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like \\u201coh shit\\u201d and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.\"],[\"I\\u2019m supposed to co-teach a yoga class with Les. People have arrived at the hotel. I\\u2019m there and walking around the room talking to the students. Then I realize I\\u2019m wearing a short white cotton dress. The room is heating up for class. I realize I\\u2019ll sweat and this dress will be transparent and I won\\u2019t be able to demo in it. I look up at the clock and see that I have just enough time to slip over to the boutique and pick up some yoga clothes. When I get there, the people are really helpful. They give me a bodysuit. I slip it on but it doesn\\u2019t look good at all. It\\u2019s taking a lot more time than I expected and there aren\\u2019t many other appropriate options for my body or teaching. Then I find a little pair of stretchy corduroy shorts and a top. I pull them on and think it will do. I go back and when I get back, the class is almost over and I\\u2019ve missed the whole thing while I was trying to find appropriate clothes to teach in.\"],[\"I\\u2019m swimming underwater with really bright colorful fish and coral contrasted by big black octopus, seal, shark and people swimming in snorkel or scuba gear. I\\u2019m struck by the contrast between color and black.\"],[\"I\\u2019m taking care of horses. There are a bunch of small properties next to each other. The boundary lines aren\\u2019t organized. The parcels are shaped oddly. There are some fences holding horses. In one place, the horses aren\\u2019t being well cared for. I have a job here now, and I don\\u2019t know what to do, but at least I care and in caring I\\u2019ll be able to help the horses.\"],[\"I\\u2019m traveling in a car with all my siblings - it\\u2019s a van so we can all fit. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. We seem to be having an okay time. The scene changes really suddenly and there\\u2019s an impression that a lot of time has passed - weeks, months, perhaps. I\\u2019m really confused and don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019ve gotten to where I am. I feel like I\\u2019m waking up or seeing things that are really new and strange for me. My mom is there and she tells me that the car I had been traveling had crashed. My dad had been driving it and the accident was pretty bad. Everything is okay now. My body is fine. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with me. It seems so strange that there could have been an accident and I don\\u2019t remember it at all. She tells me it was pretty bad. I have no idea if my siblings or dad made it because it\\u2019s just me and my mom. The scene changes again and I\\u2019m with a bunch of friends from high school and some friends from now. We\\u2019re in a basement of a building. It has a huge storage unit and has all kinds of things in it from older times but also feels like a theatre costume room. We\\u2019re searching for a very specific item for one of my friends. As we go through all this stuff, it seems kind of weird - all these random bits of fabric and buttons. But we\\u2019re not finding what we\\u2019re looking for. Then the scene changes again. I\\u2019m on a soccer field and I\\u2019m really wanting to play, but I have these white shoes I need to put on and it\\u2019s taking me forever to put the shoes on and the laces are really long. My friend who is also a masseuse is there as well. He\\u2019s playing soccer and he\\u2019s playing really well. I want to go and play, but I also feel like maybe I\\u2019m not good enough and maybe that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s taking me so long to put my shoes on. Although he does keep trying to pass me the ball, but I\\u2019m still on the sidelines. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m not allowed to be on the team. It\\u2019s a full size field and a full size ball, then it suddenly switches to a very small room. We\\u2019re all still trying to fit in and play soccer, and the ball has shrunk down to about the size of a softball and it\\u2019s yellow. My friend keeps trying to pass the ball to me and I keep missing. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019ve never played soccer before. Then I get tired of it because I feel like I really can\\u2019t play and I can\\u2019t get these shoes on. All of my high school friends are still around and one of them is in a bed. I go sit on the bed and talk with her. Then a bunch of others come. They\\u2019re talking about all these adventures they\\u2019ve gone and are going to go on, and all these places they\\u2019ve seen around the world. I\\u2019m sitting there feeling frustrated because I\\u2019ve not done any of that - in my whole life, I\\u2019ve not gone to have a vacation in Costa Rica or Belize and they\\u2019re telling these fantastical stories of when they\\u2019ve gone. They\\u2019re also very chummy, but I feel like the outsider - definitely outsider vibes. Then the scene shifts a little bit, and while there\\u2019s still this big bed that we\\u2019ve all congregated on, now they\\u2019re talking about Brad Pitt and another actor from way back in the day. They\\u2019re talking about how Brad Pitt keeps saying that he could date any woman he wanted, but oddly enough, he\\u2019s still single and nobody really wants to date him and how he just brags all the time. Then we\\u2019re talking about Jennifer Lopez and how she has so much money because she bought an open market in France and charges a commission for each store that is there in the market and so she just makes this passive income forever and ever. Even magazines have commented on how she has this structure and foundation so she doesn\\u2019t have to rely on the work she puts out and if her albums are any good. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m trying to record a meditation or yoga video. I\\u2019m setting up my space and the camera, trying different locations and viewpoints. I need to set the camera at an angle so it doesn\\u2019t highlight my scoliosis because I think it would be a distraction. I set myself kind of under the staircase. I get a good frame but then realize my son\\u2019s Mickey Mouse car is in the frame and I have to rearrange the space again. It\\u2019s frustrating and I\\u2019m running out of time. I\\u2019m wondering where else I could do this, but anywhere else would have distracting background noises. I just want to get this done and move on. Earlier in the dream, there\\u2019s a show that we are preparing. We are a random group of people and I don\\u2019t recognize any of them. We haven\\u2019t rehearsed together, but are now suddenly being pulled together for this performance piece. I\\u2019m getting ready and a few women are helping me with my makeup. I need to choose a foundation and am asking them for their recommendation. One might be a bit too brown, but they say the pink one is nice and youthful. These women are very good with makeup and skilled in its application. I\\u2019m not so skilled with this particular art, but am grateful for their help. A woman is here and she is stealing everybody\\u2019s intellectual property by observing and copying their performances exactly. She\\u2019s stolen away and we have to find her and be sure she doesn\\u2019t succeed. All I have as clues is that she is wearing pale silk fabrics.\"],[\"I\\u2019m waking up at a festival. I\\u2019m walking through to the ocean or bay. I see that some others are still sleeping and the beds are set up to be floating over the ocean with only a white gauze curtain around for a little privacy. I\\u2019m curious about it. I see my friend Maxine walking around in a huge hoop skirt. It looks like she\\u2019s wearing a long curly wig that goes all the way to the ground. Other people are dressed up in festival attire. I don\\u2019t think I am, but I can\\u2019t sense much about myself. There\\u2019s a water slide that people go down to splash in the water. I\\u2019m supposed to be covering Sophie\\u2019s shift. I don\\u2019t know whether it starts at 9 or 9:30, but I need to get there. But now it\\u2019s raining and grey, and I know I\\u2019m in San Francisco. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019ll get there and park and be on time. It\\u2019s more complicated than I thought it would be when I agreed to help. Now I realize it\\u2019s not a chiropractic shift, but I\\u2019m subbing a yoga or meditation class for her. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in another doctor\\u2019s office. It smells like cigarette smoke and really stuffy. All the other rooms are occupied and the doctor of physical therapist is running late. There isn\\u2019t enough room to teach a class and it won\\u2019t be worth my time or energy to do this, but I\\u2019ve committed. Then there\\u2019s a scene of my sister lying on her stomach and a prince speaking with her and evaluating whether she is a good choice for him or not.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a narrow street. It\\u2019s a street in a neighborhood and all of the houses, their big front lawns with green grass come right up to the edge. I walk past a front yard with a bunch of my friends sitting at a picnic table - three women sitting there talking. One of the women has long long hair - it touches the bench she\\u2019s sitting on. She\\u2019s in the middle with two other women sitting on the side. I\\u2019m walking down the street with a friend who is gorgeous. I stop and introduce her to the women. The one with the long hair just stops and stares and stares at my friend, doesn\\u2019t say much, just drinks her in with her eyes. We sit and chat for a little bit, and then we leave, continuing to walk down the street towards a house I\\u2019m staying in.There are a lot of people out and about. There\\u2019s a lot of people in this house. This house feels packed, like I\\u2019m a roommate with many many others. The house itself has a lot of things in it. It\\u2019s a little bit dark. I go to the plants on a windowsill that need watering. I water these plants while my gorgeous friend wanders around. I watch as everybody watches her and tries to watch her and make her acquaintance. Then the scene changes and I\\u2019m no longer in the house. I\\u2019ve walked out of it, past the women at the picnic table. I hear one of them laughing and giving the long haired woman a hard time about how attracted she was to my friend. She says, \\u201cYou gave her that new York stare.\\u201d I look at the woman with the long hair to see what her response is. She laughs but she also is very very intent on my friend. Then I am in what seems like my childhood home and there\\u2019s tons of people there, too. I can\\u2019t tell if they\\u2019re throwing a party or packing bags or what\\u2019s going on. There\\u2019s a lot of people and my dad is there and all of my siblings are there. I go out to the backyard. I want to get away from all the people and I want to go to the beach. My dad is standing in the backyard getting us ready to go the beach. He has bags ready to go and next to him is this dog that is as big as a llama. I stare because it is so huge and it starts to talk and tells me it is a dog that is part of llama and is really strong. It\\u2019s carrying all of these bags that we\\u2019ve packed. Some of the bags are my siblings\\u2019, some of the bags are my dad\\u2019s. I think he and I have a bag in there. My gorgeous friend is actually still with me somewhere. She\\u2019s milling about the house, wandering about the house, and she\\u2019s wandering in and out of the backyard. While I\\u2019m talking with my brothers and sisters, trying to organize how to get to the beach, she\\u2019s in and out and people are still staring, trying to get her attention. I\\u2019m becoming agitated because I can tell that I want to get to the beach, but I don\\u2019t want to ride with my siblings. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable with any of them. I can also tell that all of the strength in my body, all of the muscles I have are gone and it\\u2019s been some time since I\\u2019ve been able to work out and move. I want to go to the beach so I can get a workout in. It\\u2019s beginning to bother me that I don\\u2019t have those muscles and it\\u2019s beginning to bother me that my friend is not paying any attention to me even though she\\u2019s there with me and I know she wants to go to the beach with us. I walk around the corner of the house and there\\u2019s a line of cars - the cars that belong to my family and cars that belong to the people that are milling about the house and the yard. There\\u2019s two cars we can take to the beach and I tell my siblings that I want to drive them myself. I turn around and call my friend and tell her to come with. She\\u2019s aloof and nonchalant. We have an argument. I ask her why she won\\u2019t engage with me or speak with me. She knows how much I love her and how much I want her to be with me, and she just does not respond until I grab her wrist. She tells me that we both have work to do and will end up together eventually and I should stop because it makes her sad. Then she walks away and I\\u2019m feeling heartbroken. When I look up, my brothers and sisters and dad and the llama dog are gone. They\\u2019ve driven off. I grab my bag and run out to the road and start screaming because I can see the van that has my siblings in it as they\\u2019re driving off to go to the beach. They stop when they hear me screaming and I run and get into the car and I sit in the back. I\\u2019m not happy about that because I get very car sick. But we continue on and I ask where my dad and the llama dog went. The kids say they went to school. My dad had to drop the dog off and leave it at the school. We drive up that direction and my brother is driving too fast for this curvy road and he misses turns. We stop and pull into a driveway to pick up another friend and for the first time in my life I tell him I don\\u2019t trust his driving, he drives too quick, he\\u2019s scaring me and I don\\u2019t want to ride in the car because I don\\u2019t want to die. The dream ends and I never get to the beach.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a street, it\\u2019s dark and wet, like it\\u2019s been raining all day. It\\u2019s not currently raining. I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called \\u201cKali\\u2019s Eyes.\\u201d I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn\\u2019t functioning well and I can\\u2019t find what I\\u2019m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I\\u2019ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it\\u2019s really crowded. I\\u2019m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they\\u2019ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can\\u2019t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I\\u2019m frustrated. It\\u2019s also still COVID, so it\\u2019s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that\\u2019s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I\\u2019d like to sit on, but they\\u2019ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it\\u2019s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It\\u2019s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They\\u2019re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other\\u2019s faces, so it\\u2019s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It\\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\\u2019t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down an alley between row houses. I\\u2019m with my husband. We walk by this one house with people gathered in the front. It\\u2019s a neighborhood block party. The front of their house is decorated with so many succulents of all shapes, sizes and colors, some in boxes, others growing like vines. I comment that \\u201cSnow and Shelly\\u201d would like it. But I mean \\u201cHanna\\u201d and I wonder why I keep calling her Snow? We continue to walk a little further. I hear them laughing about their friends \\u201cSlow\\u201d which is their nickname for Hanna and Shelly together. Then my husband and I get to the end of the alley. There\\u2019s a curio shop with all kinds of odds and ends. There\\u2019s a sign that looks like a fish and you can tell that it maybe once said Carmel, but part of it is missing so you only see the C at the fish\\u2019s face and the E-L at the tail. Then my husband reaches up and touches an interesting looking tapestry. He touches the border and tells me to touch it, too. It\\u2019s a really soft silky hair and leather texture, beautifully crafted. My husband takes it down and brings it inside. There\\u2019s an older woman dressed in a white lace bohemian dress behind the counter. There are two dogs running around. The dogs go from being really well behaved to one reaching for my fist with his mouth. While the woman is helping us check out, another dog starts running through the store and is being destructive. The man who is her husband and owns the shop with her comes out from behind the desk and goes after the dog to get him and rangle him back behind the desk along with the other one. I look at the tapestry and it\\u2019s no longer a rug, now it\\u2019s a dead dog that has been taxidermied. Now I understand why the leather was so smooth and shiny - it was once a shiny short haired soft dog. I don\\u2019t want it anymore. She says it\\u2019s really good for spellwork, protection and keeping the negative energies at bay. The man comes back and says, \\u201cYes it\\u2019s such a shame, the three dogs used to be a crew together. It\\u2019s a shame to see them separated now.\\u201d He is encouraging us to take it even though I\\u2019m apprehensive about having a dead dog in my house. Then there\\u2019s this yellow and white huge snake behind the counter next to the man. He taps the snake on the head and it starts to move. I can see its body starting to unknot from it\\u2019s sleeping position. It\\u2019s coming out from behind the desk and pushing the woman to the side. She stands back respectfully. I guess this is also one of their pets. The snake continues to unwind. The face kind of looks plastic but it\\u2019s acting real. I\\u2019m making sure to get out of the way. I\\u2019m trying to leave the shop and my husband is on the other side of the snake, also trying to get out. The snake continues to unwind and as it does, it is so huge, there is no tail in sight. Its body is filling every part of the shop. I can see the man trying to pull the snake back. I can see my husband trying to push through the body of the snake and trying to get out. Just as we reach the threshold, I see the snake open her mouth really wide and I see her fangs and tongue. The tongue is yellow and white and in the same pattern as the body. We get out.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching a fighting boxing ring at night and I\\u2019m not me, I\\u2019m an observer. Then the fight goes outside and they are jumping off of buildings dying by suicide. Then suddenly I\\u2019m watching these small vehicles low to the ground come towards me; in them young couples are wrestling the women in charge. They are sabotaging the car and pulling the men out onto the ground and then bears in cars after them. It was unreal.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching my daughter from the edges of an ice rink. She\\u2019s ice skating and doing a show. I think we were there for practice but it ends up being a show. She\\u2019s in costume. There are a bunch of other ice skaters who are her teammates. They\\u2019re on the ice in the background. Then there\\u2019s one male ice skater. The others are all lined up and my daughter is in front of them. The one male ice skater comes around and as part of the show pulls her jacket off down around her arms and her body is that of a full grown woman. It\\u2019s a very sexual sensual move and I\\u2019m pissed off because she\\u2019s still a thirteen year old and she\\u2019s being super hyper sexualized in this show. I\\u2019m so mad. Her coaches are there critiquing because it is a rehearsal for the show. My daughter skates forward to do her move and something happens that I don\\u2019t quite see and she falls to the ice. Something happens to one of her legs. I\\u2019m so mad and I go grab her to make sure she\\u2019s okay. But this is not an appropriate show for a young girl to be doing. Then everybody goes home. I have her and her brother, too. Their dad is there, too. He\\u2019s been watching. I\\u2019m trying to spend time with the two kids because I haven\\u2019t seen them in a long time. I gather them both up in my arms and hold onto them and snuggle them. Their dad leaves and gives me some time with me. I try to connect. It\\u2019s a little awkward but there is some connection. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to go,\\u201d and he takes the kids with him. I\\u2019m following them out. We head out of the building where the ice skating rink is. Now I\\u2019m in this marina, so there are boats and everyone has a dock for their boats. The boats are coming back and forth, but people are also swimming in the water. There are set times when there are no boats and people can swim. Then there is time for the boats when you can\\u2019t swim because you\\u2019d get run over. I\\u2019m showing some of the kids in our group how to swim. I\\u2019m not sure who all is with us. A few people in their boats start to go boating when it\\u2019s still swimming time. People are yelling at the swimmers to get out of the water so they don\\u2019t get run over. I see this boat coming right up the lane and I flatten myself as much as I can on the floor of the marina - I think it\\u2019s a lake floor - so I don\\u2019t get chopped up by their propellers. I get up and people start dragging me out of the water once the boat passes over. I\\u2019m horrified that no one is being careful and that we\\u2019re in the water while boating is happening. We get out of the water. Somebody\\u2019s wedding is being prepped and they\\u2019ve asked me as a friend to come and help with it. Each of their friends are taking turns helping with the wedding. I think each of us has a day that we\\u2019re helping to prep. I get my day and I have a list. I don\\u2019t know who these friends are and I don\\u2019t even know who the friends of the friends are. It's a very strange situation because I don't know who I was just partying with at the marina and I don\\u2019t know whose wedding this is. I get a list of all the things that have been assigned to me to prep for this wedding. I walk through this door that will be the aisle we walk down, but the timing is bad because when we walk through it sets off an alarm that downs a bunch of trees right over the entrance and blocks it. It\\u2019s like when a castle is under siege and you\\u2019re pulling oil over people\\u2019s heads. The building or place has a protection mechanism; it reminds me of Hogwarts in the last movie. So all these trees come down right in front of me. The couple who is getting married is like, \\u201cThere goes my aisle to walk down.\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll clean up the trees and the other people can do the other stuff on the list.\\u201d I go to do that, but I think I get interrupted. Someone stops me to help them with something, but I go, \\u201cYeah, but I really have to move these trees.\\u201d The trees were dead to begin with and they weren\\u2019t actually trees, they were really big logs that have come across this doorway. The doorway is little; it\\u2019s like a one person doorway that you would go in and out of, say through your bedroom or something. But there is a red carpet that leads out from it, but now it\\u2019s covered in logs. These logs are white, either birch or aspen that have been cut and fallen. This dream ends with me being pulled away from this job to assist the bride. I\\u2019m sitting in a circle on a bench and there\\u2019s a woman with a white dress on. Her train is huge and beautiful. Her dress is very beautiful and sparkly, probably with sequins.\"],[\"I\\u2019m wearing some kind of white shirt and very short shorts\\u2026.Someone else is, too?....I look down and see four things, two white shirts and two shorts\\u2026.one is mine, the other someone else\\u2026.Another person thinks I look silly with such revealing shorts\\u2026.I look down at myself, and decide I do not care, it is fine with me, I like them\\u2026.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a friend from the pole studio and we\\u2019re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it\\u2019s not even a possibility for me. We\\u2019re both running around looking for a pole to buy that\\u2019s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It\\u2019s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there\\u2019s no place to workout. We\\u2019re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it\\u2019s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can\\u2019t find what we\\u2019re looking for. I dream some more but don\\u2019t remember what it was. Suddenly I\\u2019m with a Native American man. He\\u2019s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I\\u2019m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don\\u2019t recognize anybody I\\u2019m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they\\u2019ve bonded somehow. I\\u2019m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We\\u2019re in the forest somewhere. He\\u2019s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, \\u201cYou have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why that\\u2019s important but that\\u2019s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I\\u2019m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we\\u2019re protesting capitalism, basically. We\\u2019re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We\\u2019re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that\\u2019s happening with these young kids and how they\\u2019re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh are we going to go in and stop them?\\u201d but the man is like, \\u201cNope, we\\u2019re just going to listen and we\\u2019re going to make food.\\u201d We\\u2019re making food to bring. There\\u2019s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it\\u2019s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I\\u2019m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We\\u2019re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that\\u2019s different from what\\u2019s being taught and told about at this parade. We\\u2019re doing a silent protest. I\\u2019m freaking out because it\\u2019s children that they\\u2019re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can\\u2019t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It\\u2019s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that\\u2019s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we\\u2019re seeing or if we\\u2019re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there\\u2019s this younger dad who\\u2019s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that\\u2019s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, \\u201cYou have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn\\u2019t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, \\u201cOh, I have magic powers? I\\u2019m going to show you my magic powers.\\u201d All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don\\u2019t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it\\u2019s hurting my people and other people. He\\u2019s just so enraged, he\\u2019s lost it. He doesn\\u2019t care who he hurts. I\\u2019m horrified because I\\u2019m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can\\u2019t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won\\u2019t stop. I finally go, \\u201cOkay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What\\u2019s really going on?\\u201d He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won\\u2019t talk to him and he hasn\\u2019t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she\\u2019s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it\\u2019s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, \\u201cAre you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?\\u201d He\\u2019s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they\\u2019re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he\\u2019s so hurt and wounded. We\\u2019re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we\\u2019re conversing we\\u2019re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He\\u2019s an older man, he\\u2019s bald and he\\u2019s wearing all black. He says to me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.\\u201d For whatever reason I see him and am like, \\u201cOh my god, oh no.\\u201d I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I\\u2019m in a towel, I don\\u2019t have my clothes on and don\\u2019t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I\\u2019m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It\\u2019s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn\\u2019t warn them and don\\u2019t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I\\u2019m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don\\u2019t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn\\u2019t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that\\u2019s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren\\u2019t even ground up. I\\u2019m eating in a safe place where this man can\\u2019t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.\\u201d I need to get clothes but I\\u2019m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don\\u2019t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m pretty incoherent. I haven\\u2019t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they\\u2019re part of the oppressor group.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It\\u2019s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we\\u2019re on our way to the place. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s a road that\\u2019s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We\\u2019re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there\\u2019s a ravine under us. We\\u2019re headed to a cave where we\\u2019re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it\\u2019s like - it\\u2019s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I\\u2019m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there\\u2019s water that\\u2019s swirling around the rocks. It\\u2019s so fun because we\\u2019re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I\\u2019m floating and we\\u2019re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We\\u2019re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it\\u2019s smooth and flat. It\\u2019s still light in a sense, it\\u2019s not full daylight. We can still see. It\\u2019s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we\\u2019re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It\\u2019s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I\\u2019ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it\\u2019s very particular, it\\u2019s something I asked for. Then it\\u2019s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I\\u2019m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that\\u2019s everywhere and the flowers - they\\u2019re gathering them. It\\u2019s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There\\u2019s now a table. There\\u2019s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she\\u2019s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they\\u2019re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we\\u2019re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we\\u2019re carrying bags of trash because we\\u2019ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we\\u2019re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn\\u2019t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people - I know some of them, they\\u2019re acquaintances that I\\u2019ve met here where I live, but we\\u2019re not close. We\\u2019ve met up and we\\u2019re going to a concert, but it\\u2019s music I don\\u2019t know or I don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not excited about it, but it\\u2019s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There\\u2019s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it\\u2019s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we\\u2019re listening, and I\\u2019m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I\\u2019ve met them before or they\\u2019re from some era of my past. We\\u2019re listening and while we\\u2019re listening there\\u2019s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it\\u2019s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m just sewing away and now it\\u2019s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can\\u2019t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I\\u2019m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don\\u2019t tangle my threads and it\\u2019s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I\\u2019m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I\\u2019ve been in a bowling alley. There\\u2019s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I\\u2019m just watching them bowl and they\\u2019re all having a really good time. It\\u2019s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I\\u2019ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It\\u2019s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it\\u2019s time for me to bowl. It\\u2019s not time because I\\u2019m part of their team or anything; I\\u2019m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I\\u2019m so terrible at it. It\\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. So, I\\u2019m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there\\u2019s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it\\u2019s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can\\u2019t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can\\u2019t go head on or straight. So it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there\\u2019s a person sitting in the way. So it\\u2019s my turn again and I go to him and say, \\u201cCould you please move so I can bowl correctly?\\u201d The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he\\u2019s watching me to see if I\\u2019m going to get it. There\\u2019s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I\\u2019m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it\\u2019s my turn and he\\u2019s not in my way, I go to bowl and it\\u2019s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It\\u2019s the most beautiful bowl you\\u2019ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people I don\\u2019t recognize. We\\u2019re all on vacation of some sort. There are at least eight of us, if not more. We\\u2019re at the rental car place to get cars for the group. There are so many of us that we\\u2019re taking multiple cars. I watch four of us get a car and talk to the rental car agent and get in the car and drive off. There\\u2019s another four of us waiting for a car. I\\u2019m hoping for a Toyota Tacoma to drive because that would be a lot of fun. So the rental car agent comes back and walks the four of us to our car. Sure enough, it\\u2019s a Tacoma. There\\u2019s another woman in the group with me and two men. The woman wants to drive and I\\u2019m like no way, because the Toyota Tacoma is my favorite car, so I\\u2019m the driver. I have the rental agent put my name on as the driver and I get the keys and we all get in. I went to drive the truck and I\\u2019ve forgotten how bouncy trucks are. For some reason I\\u2019m scared that the brakes on this truck don\\u2019t work very well. I\\u2019m going really slow as I pull out of the parking lot which looks like an underground garage. I can tell everyone in the car is annoyed that I\\u2019m driving so slow, but I don\\u2019t think the brakes work super well so I\\u2019m not going to drive super fast. We drive off the lot but I don\\u2019t remember where we go. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m with a bunch of people. There's a black guy who\\u2019s a DJ. Again, I don\\u2019t recognize anyone. I think I\\u2019m stirring a pot of soup. The guy is playing music and helping me cook or at least putting in his two cents about how it should be cooked. It\\u2019s uncomfortable for me because I\\u2019m trying to cook and he\\u2019s playing music, and I\\u2019m not trying to tell him how to play music. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s dancing but there are people dancing. We are outside. The pot I\\u2019m stirring is huge. At one point I think I put everything down so I can dance. It\\u2019s really good music and it\\u2019s a lot of fun. But then there\\u2019s another interaction between him and me. When I put the ladle down to dance, he picked it up. Then the dream fades and I don\\u2019t remember anything else.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of women but I don\\u2019t know any of them at all. They\\u2019re younger, in their twenties and early thirties. We\\u2019re together on a boat, I think. There\\u2019s water everywhere. It\\u2019s clearly a group of witches. Most of them are just beginning to learn spellwork. I\\u2019m the only one there who knows how to do it. There are rituals happening or perhaps initiation. One of the younger women is guiding us through the process. I don\\u2019t know that I\\u2019ve actually received training and I already know how to do all of it and I\\u2019m just going along and it\\u2019s perfectly fine for me to be doing that. I don\\u2019t have any need to let them all know that I already know how to do all of it. I\\u2019m just there with them, watching and observing. Each woman is taking turns and we\\u2019re creating a circle. The woman who is leading all this is standing in the center and each woman being initiated is walking in a circle around the other woman and the rest of us are watching. I\\u2019m part of the crowd watching the younger woman in the center. As each woman goes and does her initiation and shows what spells she knows, she\\u2019s walking around the other woman in a circle. The thing is, we\\u2019re all walking on water. The boat or whatever we were on is around somewhere, but we\\u2019re off of the boat and each of us is either standing on water or walking on water. You can see the shore from where we are and it\\u2019s a rocky shore. Then it\\u2019s my turn to go and walk on water in the circle. There\\u2019s a dress I put on. This dress is a purple taffeta, shiny and stiff. The purple is a deep black purple and it shimmers with black. It\\u2019s very Victorain era looking with tons of folds and gathers and ruffles, but it\\u2019s not super girly, it\\u2019s quite elegant. I put this dress on and start walking the circle on the water. As I start to walk, my power starts to rise. I\\u2019m no longer hiding that I have power and know how to use it. The water starts to churn and with the other women the water was not churning. As I walk, the water starts to churn around and around. This is where I recognize that the dress I\\u2019m wearing is actually a dress of Helen\\u2019s, it\\u2019s a priestess dress imbued with power and I\\u2019m wearing it. The woman in the center who was leading us the whole time is a little startled because this hasn\\u2019t happened with the other women she was initiating. I have a little smile on my face because I know I\\u2019m invoking something that\\u2019s a little bit older than what any of them have ever seen and that I\\u2019m calling on the water elemental and the air elemental as the wind starts to blow. I can hear that Helen has shown up or her presence has shown up. She\\u2019s whispering in the ear of the woman in the center and the woman in the center is in awe. She thinks Helen is a guide from somewhere and she\\u2019s quite in awe. I know who it is and I can hear what she has to say and it\\u2019s all wise teachings, but the awe is not there for me because I know who it is. The woman in the center passes on as Helen speaks it as prophecy. I sort of grin and let her speak as I continue walking my circle and creating this water vortex that is spinning. Then my turn is over and it\\u2019s time for some of the other girls to go. This vortex I created with the water and wind stays and adds itself to the ceremony ritual happening. The woman in the center keeps babbling on about how wise and mystical this guide is. I say, \\u201cYes, she\\u2019s quite wise and ancient and she\\u2019s very powerful,\\u201d knowing it was Helen speaking but what was channeling through her were the powers of Avalon that are very ancient and old. But I don\\u2019t tell any of the other participants what it is because it seems it\\u2019s over their head and this is a good first mystical experience for them. The dream ends with us dispersing. We leave the water and the boat but I don\\u2019t know where we all go.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we\\u2019re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I\\u2019m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I\\u2019m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That\\u2019s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I\\u2019m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There\\u2019s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I\\u2019m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, \\u201cI was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.\\u201d She lists the women, but I don\\u2019t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it\\u2019s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don\\u2019t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It\\u2019s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He\\u2019s playing with the water from the fridge. He\\u2019s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I\\u2019m concerned that I don\\u2019t have anyone to take care of him and that he\\u2019s disturbing the session. But my client doesn\\u2019t seem to notice or care that he\\u2019s interfering.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a ton of people I don\\u2019t know and we\\u2019re on a tour. The astrologer who I know from my studies is there and we\\u2019re in this huge area that reminds me of the Hawaiian Hilton where they have these big fake rocks by a pool and you can climb over and around them and there\\u2019s a slide you can go down. So we\\u2019re in this building with lots of rocks and water, but it\\u2019s also an old sewing shop. There are all these sewing patterns everywhere, still in their envelopes. The woman who owns the shop is showing us around. But it\\u2019s not a shop, it\\u2019s way bigger, and an open space. The tour is over. To get out of the building, you have to climb in a very specific pattern over these rocks. I watch somebody ahead of me. We get to this one section and it\\u2019s kind of like bouldering. Instead of taking hand and footholds, they decide to slide down the rock face, thinking it\\u2019s not so far. I watch them slide and am like, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s far.\\u201d They land in the pool beneath them, but the pool is not particularly deep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, okay, I\\u2019m not going to do that.\\u201d Then the astrologer goes and she\\u2019s a much bigger woman. She shows me how to use the handholds and footholds. She misses and falls down the rock face. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I see some younger girls, like nine or ten years old and I watch where they put their hands. They manage to get down off this part where the others were sliding and slipping. I follow them and end up in this place where there are even more patterns lined up on a bench. I recognize some of them from my mom\\u2019s sewing patterns from when I was a kid. There are other ones that are new in their envelopes. I\\u2019m looking at them but not spending a lot of time because I know it\\u2019s time to go. I just kind of try to keep going. Then the dream switches. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019m sharing with a bunch of people. We\\u2019re in the kitchen area. I think it\\u2019s mostly women and possibly my friends Shawna and Janet from high school, but I\\u2019m not sure. There are others I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m in the kitchen. There\\u2019s a double cupboard that goes from floor to ceiling. You can open these tall doors and get into the cupboard. The top cupboard has a bunch of glasses in it and I\\u2019m looking for my black nail polish. One of my gay flatmates has used it all up and I\\u2019m pissed up. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWait, I want my nail polish.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking in this cabinet for it. There are champagne flukes and port glasses and really heavy-bottomed cut crystal water glasses. They keep getting broken so there\\u2019s maybe one of each of them. I\\u2019m trying to move them around so I can look for the nail polish. I\\u2019m handing them to my roommates to put them in the trash. The trash is overflowing. I\\u2019m handling these pieces of glass and trying to be super careful, but I don\\u2019t know where to put all the pieces. I gather up the trash bag and head out to the trash, which is the dumpster area by the condo area that I live in in this reality. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with a younger version of Josh, he\\u2019s maybe in his mid-twenties, and all the people who were part of my kink family this year. There are some additions, girls I don\\u2019t recognize. We\\u2019re in a car going somewhere. We\\u2019re going through a town that reminds me a lot of Hawaii. I feel like we\\u2019re in Kona. Josh is on the lookout, scanning for other women to fuck. I\\u2019m with him and ignoring it. We\\u2019re driving by the ocean on the other side of the rock wall. We\\u2019re going past buildings. I can see surfers out in the water. I\\u2019m ignoring Josh and the constant scanning that he\\u2019s doing. Some of the kink family is in the background. He\\u2019s flirting with them like he usually does. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI have this chiropractic appointment and so do you.\\u201d We\\u2019re on our way and end up at the chiropractor\\u2019s office. It\\u2019s an open office because I can see other people watching. Josh gets his adjustment and the chiropractor cracks him really good, not the way I would allow anyone to crack me. Then it\\u2019s my turn and the chiropractor is moving really slow with me, which I appreciate. He gets to my left shoulder and is like, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s something wrong with your rotator cuff.\\u201d All he did was put his hand on the back of my shoulder blade. I didn\\u2019t tell him it hurt, he didn\\u2019t move it or anything. He was just moving me around and as he put his hand on the back of my shoulder blade, he said, \\u201cOoh, there\\u2019s something wrong with your rotator cuff.\\u201d He gets these weird hooks with rubber bands connected to them. He hooks them all together and wraps them around my wrist. He puts one hand on my shoulder and he goes to adjust my rotator cuff. He\\u2019s yanking on it. I\\u2019m expecting to hear some horrible pop, but he\\u2019s actually really gentle and just keeps pulling on it in different directions. I\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s going to be able to do anything and don\\u2019t believe he is doing anything. But whatever, I let him do it because he\\u2019s not hurting me. Then I come out of the dream a little bit and I realize that my chin is tingling and I need to go put some helichrysum and ice on my chin to stop my cold sore from getting worse. That was somehow part of the dream, too. I\\u2019m on a cell phone and I can hear everybody on my council talking. I\\u2019m listening in like I normally would because we\\u2019ve been doing our council call on zoom because of all the things. I contribute my two cents to whatever is being spoken about. One of the other council ladies is like, \\u201cRose, are you there?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I called in.\\u201d I think it was Aila. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know that my phone was on and you could hear me. Did you know we were meeting today?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I knew. Although I didn\\u2019t know you were all meeting in person. Did you all plan that?\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, we didn\\u2019t think you were coming so we\\u2019re all meeting here in person.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! Okay I\\u2019ll just come and find you.\\u201d I go find them, but there\\u2019s that yucky feeling of being left out. I go and see them. It\\u2019s fine. Everybody is there and we\\u2019re all talking. For some reason the topic of dicks comes up. Aila is like, \\u201cYeah, you should see the one I got!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s talking about. Did she get a dildo? Is she talking about her partner? I have no idea. Beth chimes in and is like, \\u201cYeah, look at mine.\\u201d I\\u2019m sitting on the ground and turn to the right and look up. She has her pants pulled down and she has a dick that\\u2019s half chub. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBeth! Is that yours? Did you get a sex change?\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s my partner\\u2019s. I just took it for a while.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know you could just do that. Okay.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with all my classmates from high school. We\\u2019re in an outdoor setting. I can see reeds growing in a river. The air is fresh. It\\u2019s definitely twilight into nighttime. I don't know why we\\u2019re all there. The energetic feeling is heavy. Some of us are sitting in chairs, some are standing. We\\u2019re milling about like at a party. The mood is somber. I\\u2019m wondering why we\\u2019re all sad, I don\\u2019t get it and don\\u2019t see a need or reason for us to be this way. I make a decision to cheer everybody up. It\\u2019s a little scary for me to make this decision because now I know I need to put myself out there. I start making jokes. I don\\u2019t know what the jokes are about. I feel myself try one joke with a bit of trepidation to see if people will laugh, and they do. I get a little bolder and continue to make situational jokes using things that are happening in the moment and pointing out the environment and saying funny things. People are laughing and the whole mood of the dream changes from this really dark, heavy, somber mood. It doesn\\u2019t get all the way happy, but there is a relief with laughter. I can see Shawna laughing. That changes the whole dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Anya, Moira, Kel, and a new patient who I haven\\u2019t met yet. The office is down the street from a big house that is being used for multiple offices. I\\u2019m in the house. Anya and Kel are helping me set up the tables upstairs. People are arriving for sessions. A fire is lit in the fireplace. It\\u2019s dark and musty. There are quite a few massage and chiropractic tables folded in their traveling bags. There are tables and stacked chairs. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to set up the table for privacy and professionalism for my new patient, but it\\u2019s chaotic. This is a way for me to practice and for people to watch me work and potentially become patients.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my brother, sister and son whois 4 or 5 in this dream. We\\u2019re on a rooftop of a building. The building is a college. I have my son in multiple pairs of pants. He\\u2019s old enough to get dressed himself and he comes out wearing this. Even though he seems to be younger, he\\u2019s also 9 - his age is ambiguous. My brother is young and looks as though he did in high school. My sister also looks younger, like how she did in high school. There\\u2019s a break in college and we\\u2019ve all met up between classes and have gone out onto this rooftop. You can see this black wall of clouds off in the distance. They are turning greenish and as I\\u2019m watching, they form a funnel and there\\u2019s a tornado heading our direction. I\\u2019m yelling at my son to go in the door we came out of onto this rooftop. There\\u2019s also a set of fire escape stairs. My brother is over there. My brother and sister were excited about the parties they were going to go to. They are totally doing the college thing. But I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019m too old for this shit and I don\\u2019t drink - it\\u2019s not my thing - plus I have this little one to take care of. So I see this funnel and am yelling at my brother and sister to look and be careful. I\\u2019m also yelling at my son to run back in the door inside where he\\u2019ll be safe. My son goes inside and is panicked. My brother and sister do not believe me and just stay out there. I watch through this thick glass window. As the storm tornado goes by, this woman appears and she\\u2019s sitting in a chair. The chair is small and wooden with two slots across the back. It\\u2019s like she was the tornado or was in the tornado. She\\u2019s telling my siblings what to do. So instead of the tornado sucking them up and carrying them off, she\\u2019s telling them to go jump off the edge of the roof. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to die either way, but I\\u2019m telling you that instead of sucking you up, you\\u2019re just going to jump off.\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified. I want my siblings! But I also want to protect my son. I know at any point, if she turns around and sees us or especially sees my son, she\\u2019ll kill us, too. So I\\u2019m not being gentle with my son at all. I\\u2019m being really rough and have grabbed him by his shirt. I\\u2019m shoving him down because there\\u2019s a dresser between us and the window. The woman is on the other side. All I can see is the back of her and she\\u2019s sitting in the chair. Her hair is dark and is up in a bun. I can\\u2019t see much else. So I\\u2019m shoving my son down so she can\\u2019t see him. The dresser is between them. He keeps trying to pop up to see her, and I very roughly shove his body back down. I\\u2019m yelling at him to stay down so she can\\u2019t see him. I see my brother and sister disappear. She disappears and the funnel dissipates even though the clouds dissipate. I tell my son to stay and I go out the door to look. Of course there is no sign of my brother and sister anywhere. My son is distraught. He\\u2019s screaming and crying and so mad at me for being rough at him and so upset about his aunt and uncle leaving. He regresses into a younger child, from 9 to 3. I feel horrible because I was so physically rough with him and verbally unkind in trying to keep him hidden. I think I just traumatized him in so many ways.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my dad and my mom, my five brothers and my sister. I think it\\u2019s the whole family. We\\u2019ve had to go through customs or some kind of holding area. There was a conference - somebody was giving a talk and we were there for that talk. We had to get on a tram to get to the airport lounge to get on our plane. I\\u2019m there where I\\u2019m supposed to be. But two or three of my siblings are not there. We can\\u2019t find them. I\\u2019m starting to get stressed because they haven\\u2019t met us where we\\u2019re supposed to all be. The communication between my parents and siblings is shit. No one is telling anyone what they need to know. Part of it is we either don\\u2019t have our cell phones or don\\u2019t have service. There\\u2019s an actual physical communication breakdown, but also distance. Some siblings wander off and miss the tram they\\u2019re supposed to be on and don\\u2019t show up where they\\u2019re supposed to go. I get two or three of my siblings and we show up where we\\u2019re supposed to go, but then we realize we\\u2019re in the wrong spot or the gate has been moved. We have to get back on another tram and go back to where we had come from, or so I think. We go and we do it. My parents and my grandma finally get a hold of us and are like, \\u201cNo, you could have stayed where you were at. Now it\\u2019s going to take you longer to get where you\\u2019re going and you\\u2019re possibly going to miss this plane or tram.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure which - plane or tram. There is a lot of back and forth, not going to the right place, not finding each other, not communicating well. We realize we are retracing steps we didn\\u2019t need to retrace. We didn\\u2019t have to go back to the place we went back to. It would have been better if we stayed where we were, or even better, moved forward. This moving forward is just a vague sense or feeling that there\\u2019s a moving forward that could happen. But trying to get me, all my siblings, my parents and my grandma all in one place so that we can all travel together is just not happening. Two of my siblings are pissed at me for leaving them behind even though they wandered off - they took it upon themselves to go elsewhere and then were mad at me that I didn\\u2019t take them with me when it was time to go. So lots of feeling of frustration and herding cats, then me going like, \\u201cHey, wait a second, you all are adults. I\\u2019m not responsible for you! Yes you\\u2019re my younger siblings. But you are adults who can get yourself where you need to go. So I don\\u2019t need to worry about this so much!\\u201d That was the overall tone of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We\\u2019re outside and there\\u2019s a picnic table. I think there\\u2019s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We\\u2019re a part of that. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She\\u2019s hosting. I\\u2019m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They\\u2019re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it\\u2019s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There\\u2019s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I\\u2019m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I\\u2019m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they\\u2019re saying and learn from them. I think I\\u2019m really not welcome here. I don\\u2019t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I\\u2019m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It\\u2019s getting heated. They\\u2019re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I\\u2019m feeling all of these emotions. I\\u2019m pissed that that\\u2019s their reality and mine. I\\u2019m pissed that I feel like there\\u2019s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it\\u2019s more equal and fair for everyone. I\\u2019m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I\\u2019m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They\\u2019re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they\\u2019re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, \\u201cHey, I want you two to know that I\\u2019ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you\\u2019re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don\\u2019t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I\\u2019m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn\\u2019t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can\\u2019t tell if they appreciate what I\\u2019m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I\\u2019m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There\\u2019s a wooded forest behind me. There\\u2019s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I\\u2019m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they\\u2019re young. I\\u2019m a young adult in this place, or I\\u2019m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They\\u2019re playing and they\\u2019re hungry. They want something to eat. There\\u2019s a guy and in my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201coh my god, pedophile.\\u201d I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they\\u2019re playing. The kids say they\\u2019re really hungry and the guy is like, \\u201cWell, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019re all hungry. There\\u2019s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don\\u2019t even know where it\\u2019s plugged into. It\\u2019s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don\\u2019t want to take the meat from this guy because I don\\u2019t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He\\u2019s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he\\u2019s watching them play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t even watch them play.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it\\u2019s safer. I don\\u2019t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I\\u2019m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that\\u2019s right after me. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re talking about. We are in a different place. They\\u2019re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they\\u2019re in is devoid of trees. It\\u2019s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn\\u2019t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I\\u2019m talking to them and I\\u2019m checking in with them. But part of me doesn\\u2019t want to be talking about this with them because they\\u2019re not listening to me. They\\u2019re not hearing me. I\\u2019m not getting a say. I\\u2019m not getting to use my voice about this. They\\u2019re just telling me how things are. I\\u2019m annoyed because that\\u2019s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They\\u2019re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they\\u2019re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, \\u201cDo you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?\\u201d But they\\u2019re not listening and not open to it. I\\u2019m not saying anything. I\\u2019m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friends who are part of my council. We\\u2019re all gathered. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re doing, an adventure of some sort. My one friend who is in the middle of leaving her partnership is with me. She\\u2019s the nearest to me. The other friends are more in the background. We are getting on boats in the ocean. I don't know where we\\u2019re going. The founder of Astrology Hub which is a service I pay for is also there. I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I think she\\u2019s leading this excursion adventure we\\u2019re going on. There\\u2019s a big cruise ship that everyone is getting on and then there are some smaller fishing boats that can go quickly and are pretty open but can only sit about five or six people. My friend who\\u2019s leaving her partner gets on a fishing boat with me. The captain of the boat is an older man in his fifties or sixties, grey haired, pot bellied, white dude. He\\u2019s excited to be driving us \\u201ctwo pretty ladies around\\u201d - his words. He is really fawning over my friend. She\\u2019s leaning into this free and single thing now. He\\u2019s letting her drive the boat but she doesn't let her drive. It\\u2019s kind of stormy. The waves are high, the skies are grey, it\\u2019s raining. We\\u2019re on the boat that doesn\\u2019t have a roof, so we\\u2019re going to get wet, but everyone on the cruise ship will be fine and dry. There are cameras around and this is being filmed or recorded. I\\u2019m watching another friend do a spiel for the cameras, but I can\\u2019t hear what she\\u2019s saying. There is a hustle and bustle as everyone gets on the boats. So we start to head out into the ocean and the old guy is letting my friend drive. My friend is loving it and saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m so free!\\u201d The wind is blowing in her hair and she\\u2019s so excited and so happy. I\\u2019m sitting in the back and am like, \\u201cYes, you are totally free right now, but it feels like the pendulum is swinging the other way.\\u201d At one point I look over and she\\u2019s making out with this old guy who is not her type and kind of gross. She\\u2019s like twenty years younger than him. I remember going through this phase and know this is a phase she has to go through - whatever floats your boat girl. We head out into the ocean and I have a sense that the cruise ship is around but I don\\u2019t see it and I don\\u2019t see the rest of my friends on council, I just know they\\u2019re there. We\\u2019ve gone from being in a wide open ocean to canals like in Venice. We\\u2019re going through these waterways with buildings on either side. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but my friend is still driving and she\\u2019s still making out with this guy. She\\u2019s also talking about all her dreams and all the things she\\u2019s going to do. She has flowers in her hair and is wearing a shawl. I\\u2019m wondering now what happened to the cruise ship and all our other friends. I\\u2019m ready to get off the boat because I\\u2019m feeling seasick. I don't know if we ever get to our destination or not. But the scene changes and I\\u2019m on dry land. I\\u2019m with a bunch of other people I know. I can\\u2019t tell if we\\u2019re at a grocery store where we\\u2019re all working or somewhere else and hanging out. It\\u2019s a bunch of random men I know - some co-workers, some classmates, some others. It reminds me of a beehive or anthill energy - a bunch of busyness, coming and going, coming and going. People are doing things. We all have our own projects. It dawns on me that every single man is wearing a sweater I knit for them in this dream. Some of the men are my childhood buddies that I grew up with, too. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh I knit you that sweater!\\u201d The sweaters are all different styles and colors. It\\u2019s clear they\\u2019ve been worn a lot. The funny thing is that they\\u2019re just wearing the sweaters, but not saying, \\u201cHey, I\\u2019m wearing your sweater!\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my partner and his dad. We\\u2019re rearranging the furniture. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood, not a house. There\\u2019s a cul-de-sac in this area. His dad is wanting to make it into an entertainment room. He buys a big futon and sets it up. He\\u2019s very childlike in his excitement about this futon. He\\u2019s showing it to me and wants to make sure it\\u2019s the right size and fits and is not too heavy or too stiff, and it\\u2019s comfortable and in the right place in the cul-de-sac. It\\u2019s so strange because it goes between being outside and being an actual room. As the dream progresses more and more furniture shows up and the room starts to be enclosed with walls on two sides and then sliding glass doors on the other side. Curtains show up. There\\u2019s a couch now and a piano and side tables etched in gold. It\\u2019s quite fancy, actually. Josh\\u2019s dad is asking me, \\u201cIs this how you want this room set up? What do you think about the placement of all the furniture? What about the tv? Is there a better place for everything?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it. They have the tv set up against the sliding glass doors and the curtains are drawn. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, I think there\\u2019s a better way than to block these doors with furniture.\\u201d I can feel myself standing there contemplating a better arrangement. But they\\u2019re so happy with how it is. They\\u2019re trying to convince me of why it\\u2019s good. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, just leave it, let it be.\\u201d Then the dream ends and I\\u2019m in a car. We\\u2019re driving around this same cul-de-sac and trying to figure out how to get back to that room. His dad is like, \\u201cI think if we take this way, we\\u2019ll end up where we want to be.\\u201d I can see that there\\u2019s this gate in between that cul-de-sac and where we want to be. If we go right, it takes us up a hill and I keep going like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think this will get us where we want to go.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting, I just know that even though we can see that cul-de-sac and I can actually see the futon he bought, we can\\u2019t get to it in the car we\\u2019re in. we do have to drive up and around. I\\u2019m not sure. There\\u2019s this weird sense that we get there in the car but I\\u2019m not sure why.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my son and we are going to an event - it\\u2019s a game you play and you can win money if you get the answers right, kind of like Jeopardy or something. We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it. My son is about 10 or 11 in the dream. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go do this! It will be fun.\\u201d He\\u2019s kind of dubious. I\\u2019m also a little dubious. I\\u2019m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we\\u2019re going to do this trivia type thing and it\\u2019s all shit I don\\u2019t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We\\u2019ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I\\u2019ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven\\u2019t answered them at all because I didn\\u2019t know the answer. I\\u2019m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can\\u2019t believe I don\\u2019t know the answers to any of these things. I\\u2019m going like, \\u201cWell, this is shit I don\\u2019t care about, so of course I don\\u2019t know the answers.\\u201d All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I\\u2019m completely clueless. Their judgement and my judgement are super real. My son is looking at me like, \\u201cMom, this is not fun.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, this is not fun at all.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting to leave because I honestly don\\u2019t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with the kids and I\\u2019m in a city I don\\u2019t recognize at all. I think it\\u2019s supposed to be Seattle because there\\u2019s ocean and hills. It\\u2019s definitely a city. My ex shows up and his parents show up. I get this feeling of, \\u201cOh my god, get the fuck away from me.\\u201d His dad is the most prominent person in the dream. He\\u2019s scolding me like I\\u2019ve done something wrong and I need to go with them somewhere. We get in the car - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s my car or their car, but it\\u2019s a stick shift. I\\u2019m driving it backwards, like I\\u2019m in reverse the whole time. I\\u2019m having a fucking hard time staying on the road the GPS is telling me to go on. I keep driving onto the wrong road. At one point I get in a parking lot and I go around the parking lot three times. His dad is being condescending and telling me I\\u2019m going the wrong way. But I\\u2019m driving the way he wanted me to drive or the way he was showing me to drive and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m having such a hard time. Finally after three or four attempts of trying to get on the right road to get where we were supposed to be going, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck it.\\u201d I stand up and turn around and sit in the car facing the way I\\u2019m used to driving it. Then we start heading towards their hotel room in the city. The kids and I were closer to the beach on the outskirts, but now we\\u2019re heading into the city. I don\\u2019t want to be with my ex, his dad or his mom. I don\\u2019t want to be in this car. I don\\u2019t want to be in this city. All of this is so wrong. Now I\\u2019m driving facing the right way and I\\u2019m following the GPS but it\\u2019s taking me weird places. I\\u2019ve never driven in this area before. We go through residential areas and I drive on the wrong road but we make it through. Then at some point I\\u2019m like \\u201cFuck it, I\\u2019m not going to take this car because it\\u2019s going wrong places.\\u201d Now the GPS is saying, \\u201cOkay get out of the car and now you have to go on foot through all these places.\\u201d It\\u2019s still coronavirus times and there are all these weird things we have to do. Everyone else is wearing a mask but I\\u2019m not. At one point we are walking through a block party. I\\u2019m in the lead, but I can feel them behind me and the pressure to get it right and perfect is so intense. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because I don\\u2019t want to be there and I don\\u2019t want them to tell me what to do and I don\\u2019t want them to follow me and I don\\u2019t want to go to their hotel room deep in the middle of the city because they\\u2019re going to lecture me about some shit that\\u2019s not mine to do. I feel so much frustration. I\\u2019m taking a wandering meandering path. I walk through this block party and through somebody\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s a college kids party. I\\u2019m watching all the young college kids and can remember when I used to be like that and do that kind of shit and just be drunk as fuck. None of them are social distancing and I\\u2019m not either way. I walk through the house. I\\u2019m watching college girls in short skirts flirt. I don\\u2019t know if I see any guys at the party. I walk out the front yard and through another neighborhood. I\\u2019m walking down one road, but my ex\\u2019s dad is pointing up to one road that\\u2019s parallel to us - it\\u2019s like a freeway and there\\u2019s a chain link fence between that one and the one I\\u2019m on. He\\u2019s pointing up to that one like I\\u2019m supposed to be up on the freeway. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh fuck no, I\\u2019m not walking up there.\\u201d I just keep going. They\\u2019re following me somewhat reluctantly. At some point, our paths do diverge and they go off somewhere. They end up in front of me and I start following them. Now we\\u2019re walking through a designated green area and park in the inner city. There are all these trees. We\\u2019re downtown on a street with four lanes. We hit a stoplight. We\\u2019re walking. There are black people lined up on either side of this road, sitting on a bench that seems to go on forever. In the background is a park with trees. I\\u2019m just walking through and wondering if this is a safe place for us to be walking through because we\\u2019re a bunch of white people and they\\u2019re a bunch of black people. My ex father in law and mother in law are not the most savvy about anti-racism. I\\u2019m hoping they won\\u2019t talk. We walk through this area and get to this place where there is scaffolding on the sidewalk that they've put up to work on the buildings above the sidewalk. The scaffolding is really narrow and tight. There\\u2019s a man helping us get through it because at some point you have to crawl up and then shimmy your way through a tiny opening that\\u2019s all scaffolding. I can see through it but it's metal bars and tiny so a person bigger than me could not fit through. He looks sketchy with long greasy hair in a mullet. He looks like the character from Schitt's Creek that looks like a redneck. He\\u2019s helping me through this tight squeeze, then I see him help the others. I don\\u2019t know where the kids are. So I go through this scaffolding maze and we come out the other side. We reach the hotel they\\u2019re staying at. It\\u2019s a hotel that they used to live at but moved away from. They\\u2019re just staying at it now because they had to come get me and my ex so they could tell us off about something, I don\\u2019t know what. We go into the hotel. We go up to the floor they used to be on. The hotel is a bit shabby and I'm surprised that they used to live there. They take us up to this floor and the Golden Girls live on this floor with them along with some other people. It\\u2019s hilarious. The Golden Girls and some other people are out in the hallway where there are couches for gathering. The Golden Girls are talking and laughing with each other. They\\u2019ve just had dinner and there are plates, dishes and cooking knives everywhere. My ex father in law shoos everybody home and says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s late. It\\u2019s time for everybody to go home. None of you are wearing masks. Go on.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, here it comes.\\u201d I see the Golden Girls leave and go to their rooms. I think they\\u2019re flirting with a bunch of older men who are residents here, too. They all go back to their rooms. I see my ex father in law pick up a huge chef\\u2019s knife and he starts to clean it and put it back. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThey always leave their stuff out.\\u201d He says it kind of fondly but also with exasperation. My ex mother in law has been making comments with him this whole time, but I\\u2019ve been ignoring them most of the time. I\\u2019m still wondering why I\\u2019m here and why I\\u2019m with these people of all people. What do they want? What does my ex want? My ex hasn\\u2019t been saying much this whole time. But all three of them are giving me this vibe like: \\u201cYou are fucking everything up. You are doing everything wrong. Now we need to get you and scold you and show you how it\\u2019s really done. And these are all the things you owe us.\\u201d I want out. The only time I had any control was when I was wandering through the block party and along the street with the black people - I knew I would be fine because I wouldn\\u2019t say something stupid. But now that we\\u2019re in this old hotel where we used to live and my ex father in law is cleaning this knife, I\\u2019m waiting for them to tell me what they\\u2019re needing to tell me. But that never happens and I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re wanting to say.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with this older man in his 50s or so - he\\u2019s white with blonde curly hair like a surfer dude. His body is in shape, but since he\\u2019s 50 everything is not as firm. He has a wife, but we\\u2019re hanging out together. I don\\u2019t know what exactly we\\u2019re doing. We\\u2019re exploring some kind of weird relationship. The scene stays in mind of us in bed together. I\\u2019ve thrown the covers back to get out of bed and I\\u2019ve started my period. There\\u2019s a little bit of blood on the sheets. I\\u2019m wearing underwear, which is crazy because I don\\u2019t. There\\u2019s blood on the inside of the underwear and it has seeped through. I take the underwear off and go to take a shower. I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and am rinsing the underwear in cold water. I see the words \\u201cBlockbuster\\u201d stamped on the inside of the underwear. I\\u2019m watching the blood disappear. I get up and come back to the bedroom and the man\\u2019s wife is there. We\\u2019ve both known he\\u2019s married and she\\u2019s fine with me being around. She\\u2019s older - their age is matched. I come back and she\\u2019s there. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re caretaking me in a way. It feels strange. In another scene, my daughter is a toddler, 2 or 3 years old. She\\u2019s how she was as a baby - on me all the time. I feel like one part of me knows I need to let her be on me for attachment and all that, but another part of me is like, \\u201coh my gosh child, get off, I need to breathe.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much more to this dream, but it\\u2019s gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m working with a friend and we\\u2019re having a meeting. She also has clients and we\\u2019re in her house. She\\u2019s showing them how she does some of her artwork - some of her painting. I\\u2019ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that\\u2019s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she\\u2019s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I\\u2019m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She\\u2019s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I\\u2019m wearing. I say, \\u201cThis is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.\\u201d It feels good between us - she\\u2019s my friend and my boss. We\\u2019re having a good time and I\\u2019m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We\\u2019re in the same house area, but now it\\u2019s my house. We\\u2019ve completed our work and she leaves. I\\u2019m realizing there\\u2019s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, \\u201cHey, there\\u2019s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I\\u2019m not going to get it to you this month.\\u201d I\\u2019m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It\\u2019s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I\\u2019m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven\\u2019t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t received your rent check this month. And I\\u2019ve heard that there\\u2019s a drone outside your house and I\\u2019m a little bit confused.\\u201d He\\u2019s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can\\u2019t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he\\u2019s saying is that there\\u2019s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It\\u2019s at the windows and it films me. I feel super violated - like my privacy has been violated. He\\u2019s really shaming about it even though I didn\\u2019t know there was a drone there. But his connection finally dies and I don\\u2019t hear him anymore. I go to call him back and try to get a hold of him so I can tell him I\\u2019m not paying rent. I hear him say something about there\\u2019s going to be an inspection. Then the connection is totally dead. I feel concerned because now I\\u2019m worried about this drone. I head back to the house. The house looks like a Victorain era dollhouse - it\\u2019s got one of those roundish rooms that reminds me of a tower and a lot of frill on the trim. I\\u2019m walking towards the house, but first I\\u2019m in the parking lot. There\\u2019s a parking lot and what looks like low income housing - they\\u2019re all one-story, the roof is flat, they\\u2019ve got a carport, and they\\u2019re all connected like apartments or a motel, actually. I see a friend of mine and she\\u2019s got a couple of kids. Then there\\u2019s a sheriff and he\\u2019s inspecting the place, but giving her an extra hard time. She has the front door open and her kids are running around. He\\u2019s telling her: \\u201cYour house looks dirty from outside.\\u201d He\\u2019s making her show him her car which also is dirty. He\\u2019s totally just giving her a hard time. I\\u2019m watching to make sure that he\\u2019s not just harassing her. It feels like he\\u2019s doing his job, but going out of his way to be a total asshole. Then he sees me and he heads towards my place, and he\\u2019s like: \\u201cYour house stinks. It smells, especially right here on the back porch area.\\u201d There\\u2019s actually another guy waiting for me on my porch. I recognize him as my lover - I think - but he doesn\\u2019t look like my type at all. He\\u2019s got blond hair and blue eyes. He\\u2019s kind of tall and it looks like he\\u2019s just come from a football game because he\\u2019s got his football gear and he\\u2019s really sweaty, stinky and smelly. But I guess this is my person because I\\u2019m really happy to see him. He\\u2019s standing on this porch where the law enforcement person is telling me it smells really bad. I look and I see there\\u2019s a window seat that juts out from the house over the porch a little bit. Underneath the window seat is one brown wool sock and one bottle of forgotten soda or something. But the foundation of this porch is all stone and is rotted - there\\u2019s moss and it\\u2019s black and the stone is crumbling. My lover is standing up there and he comes down and he greets me. He shushes the sheriff and we start to go into the house. But my brother shows up. He starts to dig out the stone that\\u2019s rotted. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it!\\u201d I know that the smell coming from it and whatever is under it is supposed to stay under, like it\\u2019s an old ancient curse or something - kind of like they bury vampires. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d But my brother starts digging it up. Sure enough, there\\u2019s a body wrapped in chains. It\\u2019s folded in on itself. As soon as my brother gets the rock off, it unfolds itself and it\\u2019s a king. I\\u2019m horrified: \\u201cNow you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve just let the bad guy out.\\u201d Then I hear some other rock crumbling. I\\u2019m up in the tower place now because it has all the windows. I turn and from my vantage point, I see that the queen has been let out, too. She\\u2019s also been in chains. They both have gunk on them because they're so old. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck, this is not good.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to grab me and my lover - now we have to leave the house. Now we have to get down these stairs and past these things and out past the house. There\\u2019s a level of horror and also comedy because the queen is hideously ugly and she\\u2019s just bitching. She\\u2019s clearly very bad tempered and it\\u2019s a little bit cliche in that way. We\\u2019re coming down the stairs trying to avoid them and we do make it outside. I don\\u2019t know what happens to my lover - he disappears. I run into this 11 or 12 year old boy. He\\u2019s kind of playful and naughty - very much trickster energy. I can hear a voice that\\u2019s sort of narrating what\\u2019s happening with this queen and king coming out and this boy who is kind of teasing. He\\u2019s running off away from me and the queen and king are trying to follow him. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re the bad guys trying to catch this boy, but this voice that I\\u2019m hearing suddenly shows up. It\\u2019s a man with a troubadour hat with a feather and he\\u2019s dressed in stockings - like Shakespeare, old style. He\\u2019s got one of those frilly collars around his neck. It turns out he\\u2019s the one that either the king and queen are chasing, or he\\u2019s chasing the boy. I\\u2019m not sure. It\\u2019s a little convoluted. I just know it's time to get the hell out of there because whatever is happening is not my business. The house is a lost cause. I have no idea where my lover went. My brother is off - I don\\u2019t know where he went; he let these things out and now he\\u2019s gone. I\\u2019ve been heading towards a crowd, following this boy and watching things unfold and I just let myself get lost in the crowd.\\n\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been asked to start and run a restaurant. The bare bones of the restaurant are in place - there\\u2019s a kitchen and a place for people to eat and a menu that I created. But there\\u2019s no staff. I have to do the cooking, serving and cleaning up all at once. The people who are eating know this is an experiment. There are three tables of people. They\\u2019re all putting in their orders and are very expectant. It\\u2019s just me. And there\\u2019s one other person who\\u2019s watching me and helping me a little, waiting for my direction, but more observing. I\\u2019m panicked because there\\u2019s too much to do. There\\u2019s no way to cook and serve and clear the tables and get everyone\\u2019s order and fill the water glasses all at the same time. It\\u2019s just too much. I\\u2019m trying as hard as I can. Everything is white in this restaurant - white table cloths, white walls, white floor - and part of it seems outdoors, there is no ceiling. After the meal is entirely served and I\\u2019m all done, the tables have nothing but complaints about the service, the food and how terrible everything was. I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou all volunteered for this and you knew that it was just me and I said it was not going to do all the things. But you guys all wanted this and you did it anyway. And now you\\u2019re critiquing me for it when I told you it wasn\\u2019t possible for me to do everything and I would need help.\\u201d I was panicked and frustrated.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve come in off the streets - it\\u2019s a neighborhood, city-like feel with lots of people. It\\u2019s dark, not quite night. I go into a shop where I work. We sell lights - beautifully made unique chandeliers and light fixtures. There is also art on the wall. I work for an older woman in her fifties or early sixties. One of my duties is to clean up. The shop looks kind of dusty and the lights haven\\u2019t been cleaned in a while. There\\u2019s a lot of clutter everywhere on the counters and whatnot. Some of the clutter is mine that I\\u2019ve just left around. There\\u2019s a pair of jeans and a wet towel on the countertop. It\\u2019s just really messy. The relationship I have with this lady is familiar but not healthy. This asian man walks in and wants to buy a chandelier. He picks out one that has panes of green glass - the glass is cut into rectangles and squares. The woman is selling it specifically to him - it\\u2019s not like he has just wandered in. He has to decorate his elderly parents\\u2019 flat. He needs lights no matter what and is very consciously picking out the lights with the green tones. He thinks that his parents will like it. To him, it also has significance around healing and keeping them healthy. The owner of the shop is wrapping it up for him. I was in the back cleaning up the towel and that weird pair of jeans. There\\u2019s another chandelier that I was looking at earlier and showing the shop owner. It\\u2019s a longer chandelier - maybe five feet long - with thick brass or gold round tubes that hang down from the top where the light is. It also has a cascade of glass panels like the other one, but the panels are not blue and green, they are the colors of a pastel rainbow. I say something like, \\u201cThis is our unicorn chandelier.\\u201d I put it down while I was cleaning. It needed to be cleaned and it was definitely one of our more expensive pieces. While this asian man is being run up by the shop owner, I give him a tour of some of the other chandeliers. I get this hit that he needs another light. I show him this one chandelier and he\\u2019s gobsmacked in total awe. He doesn\\u2019t even ask the price. He doesn\\u2019t need me to tell him about it. He just knows that it\\u2019s his. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. This is a beautiful piece of art and the healing properties within this one are even more than the one you\\u2019re buying.\\u201d So he takes it to the front to be run up as well. In the meantime, I\\u2019ve cleared out all of the junk from the shop, including all these wet towels that were on the countertops. If you look at the countertops, you can see the outline where the wet towels were. But now they\\u2019re gone. The chandeliers and art are no longer dusty. The dream ends with him taking the chandeliers, very pleased knowing that he\\u2019s going to put this light in his parents\\u2019 flat and they\\u2019re going to be so grateful. It feels like the relationship between me and the shop owner has improved now that things are cleaned and I upsold the chandelier to the Asian man. Suddenly we have an easier connection.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve dreamed about ninja turtles and movie stars\"],[\"I\\u2019ve had dreams of being in horror movies but it still takes place in my own neighborhood\"],[\"I\\u2019ve had dreams that I was in a star wars movie but it was me and my child.

My group was in a war with another group. They're leader was a skeleton on fire and we had to fight monsters. Most of them were not strong. There was just a lot of them. Darrell was on my team. Everyone was poor and living in horrible conditions. Our home was destroyed and we were fleeing to a train cart that looked like a camper. ? A black woman that was trying to save the groups baby had her legs almost burned completely to the point of being unuseable. I ended up killing the skeleton by knocking his head off and we waited for the followers to fall away and die off so we could rest. Then I think I woke.\"],[\"In my dream I was at work but it was different. We had to walk outside and there were different buildings but a lot of the same people. I was trying to get in the smaller of the two spaces that I work in. Two of my coworkers open the door. They were cleaning it and there was graffiti all over the walls and somebody had broken in and written all over the walls. I\\u2019m trying to review what it looks like but the writing was blue and purple I think it says something like \\u201cjeer.\\u201d And then I went to the other room with my coworker and there were people cleaning the room. We said hello and tried to jump on a phone call. The computer didn\\u2019t work so we were trying to use our phones and I felt like we were early but we were not and when we finally got on, the Meeting was ending. Then I walked back to the smaller office and realized there was a fence around the door. He turned around and one of the patients that should\\u2019ve been on the locked side was loose on my unlocked voluntary unit side. He was slamming and checking me against the fence and very physical. Security came and instead of taking him away, they kept body checking him over into the fence where I was against the fence and then eventually throwing him over on top of me. And when I walked out I suddenly didn\\u2019t have shoes on and I saw the security person from far away - not the one who was just body checking the guy against the fence but a different one. He didn\\u2019t help me but he looked concerned that he was pretty far away so I started walking towards the building where they were. I was confused and scared and felt exposed.\"],[\"In my dream I was flying in from Europe back to America for some kind of conference and everybody was supposed to be wearing masks but not a lot of people were and it was a really crowded conference in this one little room. All these materials were set out at all these places and we had to find activities. A lot of it looks like low function activities that I might bring for a low function OT group at work. I was trying to navigate in between these rows and there was no room to get in between them. People kept commenting on that. Then at some point I took a break from that dream and went to another dream. I was with my ex Rory and the dogs and we were running around the park, then just walking. This lady let her dog loose. One of Rory\\u2019s dogs, Trevor, isn\\u2019t friendly, so we were trying to keep him from hurting the dog and all the dogs got loose so we were chasing them up and around and climbing trees and then going up a tree. There was this group of people and this lady I knew a long time ago (somebody I\\u2019ve cut cords with in the past) and she was being irresponsible and just laughing while we were trying to save the dogs. Then I returned back to the other dream and I was trying to collect the materials I might need. Someone told me I should take this one thing and it was a picture with a cross on it to take to work. I went to go get that and tried to make my flight on time but I kept leaving and trying to return because I forgot something and was busy and cramped walking against the tide of people in the other direction. There is a friend from high school, \\u201cKaren,\\u201d and I haven\\u2019t talked to her in years. Then I woke up. Frustrated.\"],[\"In my dream I woke up and I was in my apartment but it was the inverse layout and the lights were on. There was nothing on the walls, except there was this strange out of place headless glass bust on top of the TV. It was so out of place.

Later in this dream a PT I work with called to ask how to get her driver\\u2019s license and I consulted with Rory for some reason and I was annoyed by this.

I went into her wardrobe and started pulling out clothes to wear. One dress reminded me of a favorite skirt I had a long time ago and I realized it was like a store - she has several sizes. She had all kinds of shoes in there and I remember seeing these weird foam flats that were labeled \\u201cspoonie shoes\\u201d and laughing in my dream because as a \\u201cspoonie\\u201d (someone with pain and chronic illness) I would wear these over the fun heels she had also brought with her.

My childhood home does have a stream in the backyard and this dream shows up in a lot of my dreams. The dream is a bit fragmented. I can\\u2019t quite grasp it. My father and I are standing in the backyard and looking down this short shallow hill to the stream. On the other side of the stream bed is a hill you can climb up and once you get to the top of that hill, you can look out over the land and see Mauna Kea and Haleakala and you can see the coast. The lava rock desert is on the other side of this hill and it is the actual landscape I grew up with and it is the landscape that shows up in this dream. So, I\\u2019m in the backyard with my father. I can\\u2019t remember what we are talking about. I remember asking him very specifically what my mother is going to do with the seven houses she owns before she dies. Is she going to sell them? Is there a trust fund? Is she going to give them to each of her kids? What is happening with them? He says, \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to sell them all before she dies.\\u201d I remember thinking, Why. Her whole point was that she wanted to own one house for each of her seven kids to bequeath to them. It surprises me that she\\u2019s going to sell them. As I\\u2019m speaking with my dad in the backyard, I\\u2019m looking down towards the stream. There\\u2019s a bunch of little girls. They look like me and my sister when we were growing up, and some of my friends. They\\u2019re all ranging in age between 5 and 7 and 9 and 12. They\\u2019re down at the part of the stream where we used to cross over. It was deep in some parts, but it was shallow enough in this part, so that if the stream wasn\\u2019t running really hard, we\\u2019d get our feet wet, but we could cross over and get to the other side. In the dream, there are pools. Some of the girls are playing in the water. I see myself wanting to go down there. This is the place where I see myself walking down there, but I\\u2019m also walking down there - a little bit of an observer, but also in it. We go down and it\\u2019s just play. It feels like there are fairies - very playful and very magical. It\\u2019s almost a little pocket or bubble of carefree. I don\\u2019t remember all of the conversations that happen between me and the girls - it\\u2019s not much because it\\u2019s mostly laughing and playing. My sister is there and this strikes me because my sister and I don\\u2019t have any sort of relationship and we\\u2019re barely in contact now. But we\\u2019re all in that spot playing. There are other pieces in the dream where I\\u2019m up in the house in my childhood home and my brothers are there. I don't remember what we\\u2019re saying or doing. What stands out the most is the conversation with my dad. Part of the conversation with my dad started because my grandma is also dying. So there seems to be this ending of my maternal line - at least their presence in this realm - and they are moving on to become ancestors in the dream. It\\u2019s not so much that I feel that I\\u2019m the one taking up the mantle. It\\u2019s more that I\\u2019m observing and watching. I\\u2019m not quite sure what the felt sense is.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, I am teaching a yoga class and I took it over from another teacher. At first the room is full of people, mat-to-mat. It is a chaotic energy. I start teaching. Then I turn away and look back. There is only a scattering of people. Most everyone has left and their mats are abandoned in a haphazard way, overlapping each other. It\\u2019s odd and doesn\\u2019t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don\\u2019t even teach savasana. As I\\u2019m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she\\u2019s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I\\u2019m amazed she hasn\\u2019t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She\\u2019s still not breathing. Then I wake up.\"],[\"In the morning I dreamed that I was going like in a bus or minibus to a school and the protagonists of the movie \\u201cSixteen Candles\\u201d were there and we were like in London or Italy (because of the type of building around).\"],[\"Indiana Jones and the temple of doom but I\\u2019m the little Asian kid\"],[\"is very good\"],[\"It has been a few weeks.

I\\u2019m with my friend Emma and her partner. The two of them are showing me around the city. They\\u2019re showing me places where statues have been pulled down and things have been destroyed. All the things that have been destroyed are the white male patriarchy tributes to other white males. We\\u2019re in a park. The grass is still green - Gaia is doing just fine in the dream. But all things human-made are falling down and in disrepair. I see a lot of steel and metal that\\u2019s been pulled down. It\\u2019s all crooked and bent and broken in places. She\\u2019s telling me, \\u201cThey don\\u2019t see us and they don\\u2019t honor us. They don\\u2019t care for us and they don\\u2019t put us first. That\\u2019s why it all has to come down.\\u201d Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m with my ex. His girlfriend is with him. She\\u2019s a younger blonde woman. I walk up to her and say, \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t met because this idiot has never introduced us. My name is Rose and I\\u2019m the mother of those two children over there.\\u201d The kids are in this part of the dream, too. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood. They\\u2019ve moved and they\\u2019re showing me their new house. I\\u2019m seeing where they live now so I can pick up the kids when it\\u2019s my turn. She\\u2019s actually quite easy to get along with and there's a good vibe between us. My ex is still annoying. He\\u2019s just combative with me. He\\u2019s trying to talk to me, but the tone in his voice is so condescending and really forceful. There\\u2019s no room for discussion with him. He\\u2019s just giving ultimatums. I\\u2019m not feeling like listening to that, so I ignore him as usual. I go over to see the kids. The kids are kind of squirrely. My son is happy to see me; my daughter, not so much. They\\u2019re both really clear that they want to live with their dad in this house that he and his girlfriend have. The house has swings in the front yard and a waterslide. There are lots of fun things to do here, so of course the kids are going to pick that. Then the scene shifts again. I\\u2019m in a downtown area in a community center. It\\u2019s run by people of color. It\\u2019s an education center where you can come learn about the different cultures and histories of other places. The history of the U.S. is also being taught, but it\\u2019s all the stuff we were never taught in school. It\\u2019s all the stuff that was not whitewashed and what is coming out now in real time about the history of the peoples here and how they were treated. The emphasis is on the culture. It\\u2019s all young women in this place, except for a few young men who are coming and going and some two-spirit or trans people. A young woman stops me. They are excited to show me all the stuff I never knew about their country and where they come from - their history, their roots. I\\u2019m having this crazy moment of realizing how little I do know and how exciting it is to observe these young people and absorb their love for their country and where they came from. I\\u2019m also excited to learn there is so much more to life than I thought. It\\u2019s fantastic and amazing. Instead of me feeling put upon or defensive, I\\u2019m very excited by this treasure trove of knowledge and that these people are so excited to teach. There are a few people within the community center who are a bit contemptuous of me and what they would call my ignorance. But overall, there is an excitement to share. Even though I\\u2019m the ignorant white woman, there is still tolerance because I'm there to learn and am excited to learn about all these things, especially the cultural aspects. At one point i pick up a wooden carving of India. What I notice is that unless the person hadn\\u2019t told me it was India, I wouldn\\u2019t have known what country it was. I had a moment of shame that I should have known what country this was. But I didn\\u2019t know and the shapes of the countries change all the time, so now I do know.\"],[\"It made me very worried about my loved one as it dealt with them.\"],[\"It may sound a bit deep, yet my most memorable dream was hearing my Dad cry in our bathroom. When I approached him in my dream, he was reluctant to say why he was crying. Eventually, he spoke how it was about tally marks on his tattoos. There was something wrong with them, apparently.\"],[\"It seems to me it was about violent looters. I don't remember much else.\"],[\"It starts with me riding in a car with my lover. He starts out very attentive, as he should be, then he gets high and checks out. I\\u2019m not so stoked about it because we are headed to the pole studio where I\\u2019m going to practice. I\\u2019m not sure if he was going to work out or practice. It is a pole studio/gym so there is a place for him to go workout. It\\u2019s important that he works out and trains because there\\u2019s something he\\u2019s training for. I am training, too. We get to the pole studio. Unlike the pole studio I practice at, which is light and bright, this studio is pretty dark. The poles are so tall that the tops disappear into darkness. It\\u2019s almost like the studio is as big as an amphitheatre. I have a nagging feeling. There are other people training, I don\\u2019t know who they are, but they\\u2019re all women. We get there and I realize this pole studio and workout facility is owned by Wendy. Wendy is a woman I had a crazy emotionally abusive relationship with and she is now an ex-friend of mine. Going to a place she owns is filling me with dread. The reason we were heading that way is because of quarantine, so she wasn\\u2019t there. She was also pregnant and out of the picture, so it was safe for me to go there. Now she\\u2019s no longer pregnant and quarantine is over and she shows up and starts being a total tyrant. She hasn\\u2019t seen me though, so I hide. I lay on the ground and the other women - some are younger, maybe 12 or so - all sit on top of me and do a dance. They\\u2019re like the goddess with lots of arms. They do one of those dances where each arm goes in succession. They\\u2019re sitting on me so you can\\u2019t see my body at all - I\\u2019m covered and hidden. Somehow Wendy sees me anyway. She makes them stand up and get off me so she can see me. She just starts yelling at me - \\u201cGet on the pole! Do the moves!\\u201d I can\\u2019t. I\\u2019m tired and I haven\\u2019t done pole in a long time, so I don\\u2019t have the strength I usually have. This is really hard and I\\u2019m feeling attacked without resources to defend myself, just out of my own fatigue and because my nervous system is shocked from being in her presence. She is a tyrant. She\\u2019s wearing a ballet bodysuit with one of those ballet skirts that go straight out. It looks funny on her because her body is very beefy. She\\u2019s barking orders at everyone. I feel so attacked and I really want to get out of there, but I can\\u2019t find my lover. He actually shows up, but he kind of fawns to her. She intimidates him, as well. The whole situation feels gross. One part of me is going, \\u201cOh my god, you\\u2019re not actually a victim, you could get out of this at any time.\\u201d But in the dream I\\u2019m being taken through this tyrant-victim dynamic and my lover is not defending himself because he\\u2019s high and he\\u2019s also not defending me. I\\u2019m upset about it. Then we have a dream shift. There\\u2019s a battlefield. I\\u2019m observing and not partaking in this part of the dream. Soldiers are coming in off the ocean. We\\u2019re on a beach. The ones coming in off the ocean have more primitive weapons, like lances. The soldiers maintaining the beach have guns and bombs. It\\u2019s a fucking slaughter. The ocean is red from blood. There are bodies floating everywhere and bodies on the sand. I know that the soldiers on the beach are Japanese. They come from the samurai background but are not using their samurai honor at all. Then as I\\u2019m observing, I pull back from the beach and am in a bunker. It has one window that I can see out of. There are a bunch of men - generals I think - sitting around a table and looking at a map. I\\u2019m not participating - I\\u2019m observing all of this. I look to my right and there is one window where you can see and hear the ocean. As I\\u2019m looking, a gigantic sneaker wave is coming right towards this bunker and is going to come right through this window. I think, \\u201cWhy would you build a bunker so close to the ocean. You have to know there are tides and the water can get you at any point. This is way too close to the water.\\u201d I just watch as this huge wave comes and covers the bunker. The bunker is concrete, so it\\u2019s not going anywhere, but the water that comes in the window is going to get everyone. The water gets up to the window, then the dream shifts. So I don\\u2019t actually see the water come into the bunker. I don\\u2019t see what happens to the rest of the fighting. The last impression I have is a lot of dead bodies. And it\\u2019s all men. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m on a school campus. I cross a bridge and go from the dorms which are in a forest. The forest is beautiful and the trees are not really big around. They are smaller and remind me of young eucalyptus trees. The bark is that creamy pale mixed with red. There is a lot of space, paths, fairy lights and lightning bugs. It\\u2019s pretty magical As soon as I cross the bridge everything changes and I can tell I\\u2019m in an academic setting. In front of me are buildings. People - professors and other college students - are coming at me. They\\u2019re hurrying here and there. To my right there is a stream or creek - it\\u2019s not a river. It\\u2019s this gorgeously stepped hillside that goes down. It\\u2019s not man made steps, just natural levels that go down. It\\u2019s emerald green - grass, moss and tiny moss flowers. The roots from trees make each level. I\\u2019m walking down towards the stream because I\\u2019m having an aversion to going to school or towards the college. I can actually see myself squatting next to the stream. I have a backpack on, but I really don\\u2019t want to go to school. I do meet with someone. There is a conversation, but I don\\u2019t remember what it is. I can see myself squatting down next to the water. This piece feels magical, like a continuation of the forest. There is a line where you can see you step into academia where it is grey and the energy is grey. I just don\\u2019t head that direction even though I need to - there is stuff I need to do and papers I need to write. Then the dream shifts again. I\\u2019m in a garden, the kind with well trimmed hedges that make a kind of labyrinth. I\\u2019m meeting this older woman with grey hair. She reminds me of Glenn Close when she played Cruella De Vil in \\u201c101 Dalmations\\u201d or in the movie, \\u201cThe Devil Wears Prada.\\u201d She\\u2019s totally a bitch and stalking around. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m her apprentice, but there\\u2019s some sort of power dynamic where I\\u2019m supposed to be doing things for her. I keep doing them wrong and I\\u2019m not wearing the right clothes. I get three tries. We meet together three different times. Each time I\\u2019m wearing a different outfit and I\\u2019ve brought something for her from a task I was supposed to complete. I don't remember what they were. What I do remember is that each time she sees my clothes, she\\u2019s so disappointed that I haven\\u2019t dressed the part and I don't look like her assistant or her apprentice. She says I look sloppy. She\\u2019s super verbally abusive the first two times. On the third time, I pop out and it\\u2019s not me as her apprentice. It\\u2019s someone else and I\\u2019m observing. This time I watch as she\\u2019s super physically violent with the woman who is her apprentice. She pushes her through a scratchy thorny hedge and then pushes her down into the water. The woman\\u2019s clothing is actually really lovely. She has white satin slingback high heels on and a nice coat and gloves. Each time she has met, the clothing has changed. This time, the Glenn Close character holds her down under the water and ruins the shoes and coat. I can tell there was no way this woman or me was ever going to do it right and this other woman is just crazy abusive. Then the dream switches again. I make music - I\\u2019m a music artist. I\\u2019ve made a song and it\\u2019s gone to be judged and given an award. I can clearly see recording equipment in front of me. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch and singing. As I sing, I splice in somebody else who is rapping, then I go back to singing. It\\u2019s very formulaic - a lot of songs on the radio sound like this. I am hearing the song in my head and don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s really special. It is very formulaic - just like what every producer puts out these days with collaborations between famous people, but don\\u2019t really mean a whole lot. The words aren\\u2019t really inspiring and neither is the melody or tune or anything. But I put it out and somehow I get an award for this piece. I\\u2019m sitting on this couch and the people who bring me the award are two young Japanese men who are apprenticed to a master. They are maybe in their twenties. I can see the master in the background, but the two that come, are men. They come one at a time. They are holding these gold statues of a record player. Their feet are shuffling as they approach me. They have it held out in front of them, then they bow and hand it to me. Someone is announcing in the background that I\\u2019ve won these awards. But I\\u2019m still on this couch where I can see through the walls and see the outside. I can actually see the doorframe that these Japanese men are walking through, but there are no walls on either side and the door frame itself is translucent - I can see through it. I can also see through the doorway because I can see them coming. So the first one comes and hands me the award and bows and leaves. Then the MC makes another announcement to say I\\u2019ve won another award. The second Japanese man comes shuffling towards me and bows with a lot of humility. So now I have these two awards. Then this other woman shows up. She looks like Lana del Ray, but a really young version of her. She goes, \\u201cI don't know why you won. Your song is not that good.\\u201d She plays me her song that was in the same category as mine. Her song is beautiful and her voice is beautiful - it\\u2019s haunting. However, it has the same formula. She sings, then somebody raps, then she sings and somebody raps. I\\u2019m going like, \\u201cYeah, why did my song win? Her song is way more beautiful than mine.\\u201d She goes, \\u201cI think you copied me. You just stole it.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWell, no, I definitely did not steal it. Mine is not even close to as good as yours.\\u201d It just feels like a strange thing. Those awards I won feel right. I did earn the awards according to the criteria. I did feel a sense of accomplishment. But when I compare it to what she\\u2019s created, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhoa, you definitely deserve awards for what you\\u2019re doing. I don\\u2019t understand why you didn\\u2019t get any.\\u201d So she comes at me with some competitive energy, but I am not feeling the competition. I agree with her. I think she should have won some awards.\"],[\"It turns out that our wood can help with the virus\\u2026.but we have to wait a while, for the process to go forward\\u2026.The piles of wood chips will change somehow, and that takes time\\u2026.\"],[\"It was a mix between the hunger games and world war 2.

Then I saw some other parts of the horse in the road. I looked at its eyes, its eyes were sad and red.\"],[\"It was dark, I was not me, I was an African-American woman and her daughter. I was both of them. The story played twice. I was one of them each time. There is a house we went to for safety and I think it was supposed to be a grandmothers\\u2019 house. There were old school hair mirrors on the vanity table. One night we left and it seemed like it was part of a wild game preserve or Safari or something - I don\\u2019t have a reference point for. They were giving tours at night to school children, I think. We weren\\u2019t supposed to be there so we stayed alongside the underpart where they couldn\\u2019t see us in the shadows. I remember holding onto the crumbling side of dirt and rocks and looking up. You could see the stars and you could see the man, hoping he could not see you. If you got out far enough you were free but it was dangerous like a desert. It was daytime in the desert and you could see it. The first time we went, I was the mom. I tried to hide behind a tree but he saw her and we had to get on our knees. Somehow we got away. The second time we did the same story and I was the daughter and we were much more clever.

I think I said something clever and mean, and I left something on the table. Later, I had to go back and retrieve something from a dark brick one-story building, I wasn\\u2019t supposed to be there. Somehow I got caught and the package opened and then all these people came out of the ground but they were duplicates of the same set of people, replicating over and over and over again, and then more started walking out of a school bus.

They live in a completely different state, but there she was and she was in the group). She went back to her room and a nurse came to tell me that she died in her sleep, but that it did not look like suicide (that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re always worried about at work). It looks like she just went to bed and fell asleep and died. Somebody said she was done with caregiving and she had nothing left.\"],[\"It was night. I was invited to work offsite and someone (a colleague from NYC a decade ago) came to bring me there but I wasn\\u2019t able to navigate the muddy road in my shoes. We tried to go another way but there was a large stone gate covered in green moss. I told them to go ahead without me. Then, it was dark and I was in a city (maybe San Francisco) and trying to find my way home. I found a dog and tried to return it to this house and it was a dog rescue. They asked if I wanted cats, too. I am allergic but said I would meet them. They tried to get me to take three cats and I remember feeling scared that they weren\\u2019t declawed (in real life I don\\u2019t know enough about it but my sister has a cat and thinks declawing isn\\u2019t humane). In the dream there was a dog who came with us and we left the cats. I kept thinking about my ex\\u2019s dogs because I consider them mine and wondering if they would get along. I kept doing the math that it would be three dogs total (but it would be four). This dog was about 30-40 pounds with reddish golden hair like one of the goldens, Chuck. He came home with me and my dog Pinto. In my building we are only supposed to have one dog so I was worried about being caught, but knew my dog Pinto would be happier and wouldn\\u2019t howl when I left (he\\u2019s been doing that lately) because now he would have a friend.

I wonder if I\\u2019m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they\\u2019re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They\\u2019re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest.

This time I\\u2019m in a flat that I rent with a bunch of other people. We\\u2019re in school again. My high school classmate Connie is one of my roommates in this apartment that I\\u2019m in. There are four other roommates and they\\u2019re all men and they\\u2019re really rowdy. It\\u2019s nighttime and also bedtime, so I\\u2019m trying to sleep. All of the beds are in the living room; it\\u2019s not like we have separate bedrooms to go to. The dudes are all wired, they\\u2019re totally super high energy. But I\\u2019m super tired and wanting to go to sleep. Connie is wanting to go to sleep. She\\u2019s kind of fussing over me, trying to make sure I\\u2019m okay. The guys are bouncing around the living room, fighting and wrestling with each other and getting kind of nasty and obnoxious and drinking. I\\u2019m trying to fall asleep on my bed. Even though it\\u2019s my apartment and my place of rest, I feel like a guest, especially with the way Connie is fussing over me and making sure I have all the things I need. She\\u2019s going out of her way to explain the other roommates\\u2019 behavior. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, Rose, we see you, we see you\\u2019re sleeping, but we can\\u2019t help ourselves, so you\\u2019re just going to have to deal with it.\\u201d There\\u2019s an air of \\u201ctough shit.\\u201d I\\u2019m lying down and next to my bed is a screen that separates my bed from all the other beds. It\\u2019s a light colored pine wooden screen with slats. I get a phone call from James, one of my roommates from this dream. In real life James is a friend of a friend who I just went camping with. I like him a lot - he\\u2019s a very soft spoken person and in his day job he works with conflict resolution and has the biggest heart and is so kind. In the dream, he\\u2019s calling me to check up on me and make sure I\\u2019m okay with all the noise and violence. There\\u2019s an undercurrent of violence and threat of sexual harassment. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNot really. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable or safe to sleep, that\\u2019s for sure.\\u201d The dream shifts out of this flat and goes outside. It\\u2019s still dark outside - this eerie green darkness that comes before a thunderstorm or tornado. I can see James in the distance and he\\u2019s with other people. It\\u2019s his wedding - he\\u2019s engaged in real life and they were supposed to be married this year, but they\\u2019re pushing the wedding off to next year because of coronavirus. It\\u2019s not a bright sunny wedding. I can't hear what\\u2019s going on. I can just see James and the people moving in the distance. I\\u2019m watching and I have this feeling of melancholy and curiosity.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark and crowded. I\\u2019m running away and trying to escape before Ursula finds me. She\\u2019s looking for me in the crowds. I can tell she wants to harm me. There is a conference and gathering of people dressed in futuristic clothes, all in black with coats. Somebody lets me borrow their big puffy black coat to help hide me. I put this on. There is a row of people who tell me I can blend in with their group. I think it will be a solution to sit in that row with them. Before the conference starts, I go to the bathroom. Ursula and Gemma walk in right behind me. They don\\u2019t see me and I slip into a stall. But Ursula steps into the stall next to me, to my right. Gemma continues to wait in line and I don\\u2019t know how to escape without her seeing me. I think I wait until they both use the other stall because there are only two stalls. I think it\\u2019s safe so I go out, but they are washing their hands. Gemma sees me, though. I join the row of people who told me I could hide with them, but Ursula spots me. I escape the conference center in my big puffy black coat. I go down the street to a small house where I see a boy digging in the dirt with a shovel and pale. His mom is standing on the porch. She offers to help hide me.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. I\\u2019m meeting a group of friends at a closed coffee shop for a Gaelic language lesson. I\\u2019m at the door and talking about a book I\\u2019d like to show to Justine. Justine is waiting at the door with another book, but her face is partially obscured and I didn\\u2019t recognize it was her. We walk into the coffee shop and sit at a table next to the door. It\\u2019s drafty and I want to move to another table. I look over and see a big round table that looks like it has been prepared for us. There are pink frosted pastries at each chair. The frosting is uniquely created for each person. We move over to the other side of the coffee shop, but instead of sitting at the round table, we sit at chair-desks. Then somehow, I look away and look back and it\\u2019s no longer just a line of desks, but multi-leveled bleachers packed with a huge choir. People are dressed in robes. Each section has a sectional choir leaders because it is such a large group. They\\u2019re performing Handel\\u2019s Messiah.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. It\\u2019s evening time. I am walking around a college campus. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who\\u2019s with me, but it\\u2019s another woman. I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She\\u2019s beautiful. She\\u2019s a little bit sad - she\\u2019s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she\\u2019s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it\\u2019s like an artist studio. It\\u2019s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She\\u2019s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there\\u2019s not much room. We\\u2019re hanging out with her and I\\u2019m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn\\u2019t even have a bathroom and I don\\u2019t think it has a kitchen area - it\\u2019s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She\\u2019s still really, really sad. I\\u2019m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she\\u2019s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend\\u2019s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There\\u2019s a little tension between them, like a depression. They\\u2019re together but they\\u2019re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don\\u2019t know why. They\\u2019re talking and there\\u2019s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it\\u2019s going to be fine - let\\u2019s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it\\u2019s full dark now. There\\u2019s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He\\u2019s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he\\u2019s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He\\u2019s kind of got a belly. He just doesn\\u2019t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there\\u2019s other college kids lingering around. There\\u2019s stuff happening and I\\u2019m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I\\u2019m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It\\u2019s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don\\u2019t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they\\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\\u2019s very orderly. It\\u2019s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they\\u2019re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it\\u2019s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I\\u2019m watching these people come and go and there\\u2019s this competitive energy in me where I\\u2019m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It\\u2019s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There\\u2019s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who\\u2019s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That\\u2019s the atmosphere that we\\u2019re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We\\u2019re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There\\u2019s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there\\u2019s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it\\u2019s mine. But he\\u2019s holding the baby and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I sort of like holding the baby.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don\\u2019t say anything but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, we should do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we\\u2019ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we\\u2019re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He\\u2019s in a costume of some sort and he\\u2019s asking me if I recognize who he is. I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s familiar but I can\\u2019t quite place it.\\u201d Somebody says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your gloves.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cOh yeah my gloves!\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, your Hans Solo!\\u201d He runs off to get his gloves and I\\u2019m still somehow totally content because we\\u2019re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he\\u2019s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There\\u2019s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he\\u2019s at least 10 years younger - which is why I\\u2019m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it\\u2019s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he\\u2019s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I\\u2019m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It\\u2019s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I\\u2019m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, but we\\u2019re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I\\u2019m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it\\u2019s a spaceship. It\\u2019s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they\\u2019re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I\\u2019m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they\\u2019re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I\\u2019m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I\\u2019m starting to be crushed. So I\\u2019m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It\\u2019s me and my friend, Aila. We\\u2019re in a car together, traveling. It\\u2019s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There\\u2019s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it\\u2019s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He\\u2019s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He\\u2019s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don\\u2019t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he\\u2019s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it\\u2019s the sample. It\\u2019s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that\\u2019s made out of gold and it\\u2019s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who\\u2019s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there\\u2019s something up with these bracelets because the material they\\u2019re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, we all need one of these.\\u201d He\\u2019s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it\\u2019s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that\\u2019s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he\\u2019s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there\\u2019s more, but that's all I can remember right now.\"],[\"It\\u2019s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I\\u2019m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It\\u2019s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it\\u2019s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I\\u2019m going in and out of groups and shops. I\\u2019m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it\\u2019s a shop or someone\\u2019s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave and walk out. I\\u2019m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I\\u2019m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I\\u2019m hovering - I\\u2019m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don\\u2019t see me. They\\u2019re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m standing there, but I\\u2019m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they\\u2019re not seeing me. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a lake or the ocean. There\\u2019s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It\\u2019s all outdoors. As I\\u2019m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I\\u2019m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I\\u2019m telling them, \\u201cYes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great\\u201d because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I\\u2019m not going to get any of them because I\\u2019m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They\\u2019ve gotten their cheese and now they\\u2019re at the wine bar ordering wine. I\\u2019m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, \\u201cWe actually have work to do.\\u201d There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There\\u2019s a hose right there. She says, \\u201cI have all these things I have to clean.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I\\u2019ll help you clean these things.\\u201d So we\\u2019re scrubbing containers and tubs. I\\u2019m doing all the scrubbing and she\\u2019s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She\\u2019s really sad. I\\u2019m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn\\u2019t doing a whole lot. She\\u2019s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I\\u2019m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I\\u2019m just doing the motions. There\\u2019s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.\"],[\"It\\u2019s hard to remember as it was two or three weeks ago now but it did involve me and my family getting the virus while quarantined together\"],[\"It\\u2019s just sort of a grey light. There are people sitting in chairs spaced for social distancing and scattered around. Somebody is sitting up front pointing an old wrinkled finger at people. Each time the finger points, the person is recognized as empathetic and kind. This finger is pointing at each of the people in chairs. As the finger gets to me, they hesitate. I see Jeremy sitting up there with the old one and he whispers to him, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t point to her.\\u201d It\\u2019s really unsettling and disturbing to me. The old one\\u2019s finger does point to me and recognizes me as kind. I wonder why Jeremy is so bent on seeing me otherwise.\"],[\"It\\u2019s me and another woman who\\u2019s older than me, a white lady who I don\\u2019t know. I actually don\\u2019t know anyone in this dream. We both have an idea for a program we want to put together for others, and they\\u2019re slightly different. We\\u2019re supporting each other in getting it out into the world. Suddenly when we\\u2019re in a restaurant or gathering hall. There\\u2019s a guy who\\u2019s an MC and also really schmoozy and slimy. There are suddenly a lot of other people in this hall. There are tables where food is being served. The food is being catered. Me and this woman are sitting on a couch off to the side, in a lounge area. The guy is on the stage and he\\u2019s pitching our ideas to the audience. He\\u2019s trying to pitch each project separately for people to invest in them. All of sudden he starts having the people compete and choose one project or the other. He\\u2019s leaning a lot towards the older woman and her program, I think because there are enough similarities in our programs that he decides there should just be one. I\\u2019m sitting in the lounge on the couch and I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s fine. Don\\u2019t worry about it. You do your program and I\\u2019ll figure out something else to do. I actually don\\u2019t want any part of this because it feels gross. You go ahead and do your thing.\\u201d His presentation ends and the dinner ends. The people leave. I go from being someone who\\u2019s having an idea pitched to the help. I am now cleaning and clearing the tables. The bartender is still there and there are a couple others of us trying to clean and clear the tables. The bartender is like, \\u201cHey, leave the silverware but take any extra food.\\u201d There are these lettuce-wrapped sandwiches and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cTake any of those that are extra and put them in my fridge.\\u201d I keep picking them up in my bare hands. They aren\\u2019t even on a plate. They\\u2019re lettuce with turkey, tomato, cheese and mayonnaise on the inside. They\\u2019re sliding all over the place because they\\u2019re warm at this point. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYup, come put them in my little bar fridge.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little bar fridge and it\\u2019s overflowing and I keep dropping the sandwiches and they\\u2019re opening up and making a mess. He\\u2019s kind of starting to bitch at me. I\\u2019m kind of confused because it seems very unsanitary, but he wants to use them for the next dinner I guess. I don\\u2019t know what to do except keep grabbing the sandwiches and giving them to him. He\\u2019s so rude and abrasive and controlling that I\\u2019m also a little bit afraid of him.\"],[\"It\\u2019s my birthday or some celebration. I\\u2019m being celebrated and I\\u2019m with some friends. One is my sister-in-law. There\\u2019s a whole celebration planned for me. Dinner is going to happen later. But first, there is shopping for swimsuits. It\\u2019s curious because I actually found a swimsuit that I like - at least I like the colors and the cut of it. But the top is a little bit funny. So we\\u2019re going to a shop to look for other swimsuits. This shop is gorgeous - it\\u2019s totally open and I can see the ocean and palm trees in the background. I can hear the wind rustling through the palm trees. It feels tropical or at least it\\u2019s warm. I go into this shop and there\\u2019s big windows. It looks a little like a plantation, so it\\u2019s a bit old-fashioned, but updated. The floors are wood and there\\u2019s chandeliers for lights. The shopkeeper is a woman who looks familiar to me, but I don't think I know her. It\\u2019s me and my sister-in-law and another old friend from high school, Connie, who almost never shows up in my dreams, so it\\u2019s interesting that she\\u2019s there. We\\u2019re going through the swimsuits and they are gorgeous. They\\u2019re sort of a cross between swimsuits and lingerie because the bottoms don\\u2019t cover a whole lot adn the tops are see-through in parts. They have rhinestones and they\\u2019re made of lace or a mesh netting. Some are regular swimsuit materials. They are all in different colors - black ones with sequin embroidery, blue ones with gemstones on the front. I want to try all of them on even though I already have this swimsuit on. This swimsuit I have on is cute - a salmony pink color with orange and teal and mint green accents. It looks good, except that the triangle top has layers of ruffles. I hear myself say, \\u201cI don't like this top because it makes my tits look huge.\\u201d So I\\u2019m trying on these other swimsuits, but while the bottoms all fit, none of the tops fit me - they\\u2019re all too small and they don\\u2019t fit over my back. My back is too big and I\\u2019m having a hard time pulling the tops over or getting them to stay on. It\\u2019s making me sad because some of these are really gorgeous and my sister-in-law and my friend Connie are trying them on. They look great on them. We keep picking out the same swimsuits to try on. This takes a while. It\\u2019s almost like when you go try on wedding dresses and they serve you champagne. I\\u2019m not drinking anything because I don\\u2019t like to drink, but my friends are having some and there\\u2019s chocolate. It\\u2019s quite the experience. This whole time I am aware that even though we\\u2019re trying on these swimsuits, it\\u2019s time and then past time for me to go to this dinner that\\u2019s been arranged. We\\u2019re all late for the dinner. Eventually I just say, I\\u2019m good with the swimsuit I have. The two girls buy their own. The woman who's doing the shopkeeping is quite gracious. She\\u2019s an older lady in heels and a pencil skirt. We\\u2019ve kept her past her closing time, but she\\u2019s still gracious. Then we go to dinner and dinner, indeed, has started. It\\u2019s a long, long banquet table. As we walk up to it, I can see that it\\u2019s long and there\\u2019s a lot of people. I\\u2019m not entirely sure who all is sitting at the table, but I know them. They are definitely ready to celebrate me, so I\\u2019m walking up to the table and am feeling a little overwhelmed like there\\u2019s a lot of pressure and I\\u2019m late. Everyone is eating and I take a moment and order my first appetizer. I haven\\u2019t even sat at the table. I stand up and order it from the server that comes. Then at some point I\\u2019ve been crying or something has happened because all of the makeup on my face has been wiped off. So instead of sitting at the table, I walk around the side of this building that my dinner is being served at. It\\u2019s interesting because this long long table is out on a lanai. I can hear the wind through the palm trees and ocean and it\\u2019s warm out. We\\u2019re all in pants and rolled up long sleeves. We\\u2019re not bundled up by any means. So I walk around the corner of this building on the lanai and I can see a bunch of windows. I can see into the kitchen where everything is being prepared. It\\u2019s totally cool because there\\u2019s a huge kitchen, super light and airy with maybe 15 people working. There's a head chef. I\\u2019m looking in the window and also at my reflection in the window, seeing that my makeup needs to be fixed. I have my makeup bag in my purse and start fixing it. I\\u2019m watching the server come back and tell people what I ordered. Now I\\u2019m watching a salad cook prep. The head chef is standing right there - they\\u2019re closest to me right on the other side of these windows. The people inside are all a twitter - they keep saying, \\u201cThe queen is here! We\\u2019ve seen the queen!\\u201d They\\u2019re referring to me. I\\u2019m kind of giggling. The head cook looks up and he sees me on the other side of the window. Then the other people in the kitchen see me. They don\\u2019t register that I'm the queen and they\\u2019re being kind of cute with how excited they are. I\\u2019m laughing a little, seeing how excited they are. The head chef is the only one who realizes who it is. I\\u2019m watching as they make my salad. It\\u2019s a gorgeous salad and there\\u2019s a gorgeous vegetable platter that goes with it and it looks delicious. Then the head chef and I make eye contact. He recognizes who it is and starts to get everybody else to be a little more professional. He says, \\u201cWell, the queen is right here.\\u201d They all stop and gape at me, then go back to what they\\u2019re doing. I laugh and finish putting on my makeup and go back out to the dinner. Some time passes. The dinner happens. One of my brothers and a friend I\\u2019ve known since I was 7 - his name is Dorian but we call him Johnny - they go to escort me to a ball. It is dark now. There's lights on in the buildings and twinkle lights strung between trees. They\\u2019re escorting me from the lanai where the dinner was to where the ball is going to be. Johnny is so tall. In this dream he is probably at least 6 inches taller than he is in real life and he\\u2019s taller than me. He\\u2019s just really strong and big. I\\u2019m a little bit surprised because I know he doesn\\u2019t actually look like that and I\\u2019m also relieved because he\\u2019s playing a role of protector, like Captain of the Guard. Then there\\u2019s my brother who\\u2019s taking me along and making sure all goes well as I walk between the dinner and the ball. I\\u2019m noticing the warm breeze blowing off the ocean and the moon is out. It\\u2019s balmy and beautiful. It\\u2019s so lovely that I feel my heart is bursting because of how gorgeous it is out at night. It feels very comforting to have this super tall friend of mine and my brother on either side of me escorting me to the next place that I\\u2019m going. Then the dream shifts completely and the snippet from one piece I remember is I\\u2019m at my home. I know it\\u2019s my home and I own it. I\\u2019m in the yard. There are so many plants I recognize and they\\u2019re all plants I love. There\\u2019s three lilac bushes that are planted. There\\u2019s hollyhocks growing behind me, in front of the window. You can look into the window and see my living room. I\\u2019m relieved that the hollyhocks are there. There\\u2019s lavender and a bunch of medicinal plants - so all the herbs you need for keeping yourself safe and healthy. To my right hand side is my neighbor\\u2019s house and it\\u2019s kind of run down and derelict looking. There\\u2019s an RV sitting in their driveway. It\\u2019s brown and looks like a turd - not my favorite and I can feel that I\\u2019m not excited that I can see it. Back in my garden where I can see all these gorgeous plants and trees growing, I can see a space where maybe a cluster of five pine trees that have been cut down completely. You can see the tops of the stumps and they look kind of new. But part of them rotted and I know that those trees had to be cut down because they were rotting somehow. But I\\u2019m upset because I don\\u2019t like seeing trees cut down and it\\u2019s ugly. My yard is gorgeous except for this one spot where these trees have been cut down. Then I\\u2019m talking to the neighbor woman on the other side of me. There\\u2019s a fence between me and her. It\\u2019s a cul de sac, so I can see her driveway because everything curves. She\\u2019s trying to give me ideas of what to do with this area where it\\u2019s been cut down. I can imagine myself putting a picnic table on top of these stumps because they\\u2019re all the same height. So I\\u2019m imagining a picnic table and lights strung for gatherings. But this whole section of the dream, I feel a little bit out of place and somewhat agitated, in contrast to when it was my birthday and I was the queen.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m downtown in an urban environment that I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It\\u2019s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There\\u2019s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I\\u2019m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn\\u2019t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it\\u2019s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn\\u2019t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren\\u2019t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.\"],[\"It\\u2019s twilight feeling. I\\u2019m observing a couple of people - two men who I have a feeling of affinity or affection for, or maybe there is a familial tie. There\\u2019s a young girl that we are responsible for, or taking care of. I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s a daughter or younger sister, but she\\u2019s important and it\\u2019s imperative that we keep her safe. There\\u2019s a gathering of people. We\\u2019re trying to find her a coat to keep her warm. We set her up so she\\u2019s in one spot and she gets her coat. She\\u2019s trying on coats. We are outdoors and it\\u2019s cold. We snag a coat from a rack of coats. There\\u2019s something so special about this girl. She has a light shining from the inside. Everything around us is twilight and dull looking and dirty, but she\\u2019s not that. She\\u2019s a brighter light. So we get her this coat and make sure she\\u2019s warm. One of the men feels like she\\u2019s adequately protected in this little area that she\\u2019s in. So he leaves her for a second so she can get a sense of autonomy. He and the other man - I think they are brothers - are closeby. But they don\\u2019t exactly have their eyes on her because she disappears and they start to panic. Someone tells them that the last time they saw her, she was in a shop with pretty clothes. It\\u2019s an old-fashioned shop - Victorian Era - with all the details on the outside of the building and large ceilings. It\\u2019s definitely a high-end shop from that period. I go inside and am observing as the brothers go inside where these people last saw the girl. They\\u2019re interviewing the shopkeeper. She\\u2019s a woman who only speaks French and she\\u2019s got very well-tailored bespoke clothing on, old fashioned jewelry that looks like costume jewelry, but is real - huge oval-shaped diamond earrings with emeralds all the way around. The place itself exudes high class sophistication. This is where the young girl was last seen because the front room of the shop - the showing area - is windows from floor to ceiling and it\\u2019s also an alcove that juts out into the street so that people can see what\\u2019s being sold in the shop. If you see the mannequins in the front, you can look past and see these tall mirrors where people can look at themselves where they try on clothes. But it\\u2019s all on display so people walking by can see in. So definitely, there\\u2019s a sense of expensiveness being on display or shown - if you can go in that shop, then clearly you have money. So the men go in and ask the proprietor about the young girl. I can see that the young girl had been there and the woman had shown her a few pretty dresses, But the young girl\\u2019s interest was in a pair of earrings that were really stones, very shiny and rather big, even though the young girl didn\\u2019t have her ears pierced. The woman says she gave the earrings to the girl.Then the girl comes out from somewhere in the store. The men are relieved that she\\u2019s there. They bundle her up and take her away. I can tell that was a doppelganger - that wasn\\u2019t the real girl. As I watch the men leave, I look at the proprietor's face and has this weird smug look. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no. That was not it. She\\u2019s got this girl somewhere and she\\u2019s doing something to her.\\u201d So the woman who owns the shop leaves the front area and heads through a door and down some back stairs to a basement. I\\u2019m following her. Again, she doesn\\u2019t know I\\u2019m there, so I\\u2019m still just observing. We get down to the bottom of the stairs. It\\u2019s a production area where the clothes are sewn. She has a lot of young women working for her. The conditions look okay, but there\\u2019s definitely this air of her being in charge and they\\u2019re working for her. Things look pretty clean, but I get the sense she\\u2019s not paying them very much, if at all. They\\u2019re filling the role of slave. This is the part in the dream where I start to poke around because I have the feeling that she has that young girl locked up somewhere down in this basement area. There\\u2019s one door for me to look through. But the dream ends, because I never find the girl. I\\u2019m left with the sense that the girl is down in the basement in some kind of dungeon room or closet. She\\u2019s locked up and this woman is evil.\"],[\"its good in general\"],[\"Jack n Sally on the swirly hill super happy for saving Christmas n Halloween\"],[\"Just a few snippets of dream: one is an outside battle of sorts happening. There\\u2019s some forces that are trying to wipe me and my companions out. I\\u2019m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I\\u2019m responsible as I\\u2019m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it\\u2019s a general feeling of protecting, but I\\u2019m not sure who I\\u2019m protecting. It\\u2019s not anyone in particular, it\\u2019s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don\\u2019t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don\\u2019t even know what's coming for us, I\\u2019m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we\\u2019re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that\\u2019s coming towards us. So whatever it is that\\u2019s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn\\u2019t last. As the battle continues, it\\u2019s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can\\u2019t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don\\u2019t know and his friend who I also don\\u2019t know. The first group I\\u2019m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they\\u2019re getting a tour of a ranch. I\\u2019m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also has an herb garden where they\\u2019re allowed to gather some herbs as souvenirs. I am down there with them. There\\u2019s chives or green onions that we\\u2019re growing but they\\u2019ve dried somehow. So you can pick them up and take the dried chives with you. There\\u2019s also lemongrass and a bunch of herbs and people are able to gather them. I\\u2019m gathering them and working the ranch - that\\u2019s my role. I\\u2019m part of the tour but I also have work to do on this ranch to keep it going. The man is the owner of the ranch and there are a ton of other people who work on the ranch with separate roles. There\\u2019s a bookkeeper and all these other people that I don\\u2019t know who have roles and do a lot of planning for the tours or parties that come through, they do this man\\u2019s finances and just sort of run things for him. I\\u2019m mostly a little worker bee out on the land. So this group of people comes and goes and I'm getting the feeling this is a regular stop on a tour. Then the scene shifts a little bit from daytime to evening. The man is in the carriage thing and he asks me to go for a ride with him. His friend is driving the carriage. I get in and we head down the driveway like we\\u2019re going to leave the ranch. There's a place where the road turns and on the right hand side there\\u2019s a huge mud pit. You can see old tire tracks in it, but I\\u2019m really concerned because if the carriage falls into this mud pit, it is never coming out. I\\u2019m watching the friend struggle a little bit. He\\u2019s really close to the edge and I\\u2019m concerned. He has all my attention even though this other man who I\\u2019m sitting in the carriage with doesn\\u2019t seem to be concerned at all. He\\u2019s keeping a conversation going with me and I have one mind on the conversation with him and one mind on the fact that this carriage could get really stuck and fall off into the gigantic mud pit. I finally say something to this man and he says not to worry. At this point, the carriage turns itself around so I can see the entrance of the ranch with this big sign. It dawns on me that the whole reason for the driver to have been going so close to the mud pit was a distraction technique so that I wouldn\\u2019t turn behind me and see what they were doing to the sign on the ranch. When the driver finally does turn the carriage around, I see the sign on the ranch and it\\u2019s a marriage proposal from this man in the carriage. I\\u2019m so confused because this man is essentially my boss all the time and we don\\u2019t have any relationship that I know of and all the people that work for him have been changing out this sign and preparing this whole thing. I\\u2019m a little bit speechless and really confused and thinking that there\\u2019s another person this man would rather be with. I remember sort of sitting in the carriage going: \\u201cWell let\\u2019s try some things out and see how we work together.\\u201d\"],[\"Just have bad dreams PTSD\"],[\"Just the world being really bad and the stock market crashed\"],[\"Just things about people dying and starving to death\"],[\"Last night I dreamed I was going to go get some lasagna.

Mary is there and she\\u2019s helping me find this. Then other things happen that I can\\u2019t recall. I\\u2019m on a walk along the coast with a group of people. Ursula is in the front and I\\u2019m pretty sure Mary is still with me along with other people. We\\u2019re walking along a narrow path to a festival. I look over at the ocean and it\\u2019s the most beautiful coastline. I\\u2019ve been there before in dreaming life but I don\\u2019t recognize it from waking life. Every time I see it, I am thrown into pure joy because of the beauty. It\\u2019s the most beautiful blue you\\u2019ve ever seen - it\\u2019s one little sunny protected coastline without big waves. The water flows smoothly in and out. I throw my arms up in pure ecstasy at the beauty of this landscape. Ursula looks back at me with a judgmental smirk and keeps walking ahead, but it doesn\\u2019t change how I feel about this beautiful place on earth. Then we arrive at the festival and I put my bag and shoes down. In doing this, I lose everybody and I\\u2019m suddenly alone in a big crowd of people. At first I\\u2019m not concerned, but the day goes on towards night. I don\\u2019t have my bag, money or shoes and I don't know what I\\u2019m going to do for the night. There\\u2019s a beautiful wading pool where people go to bless and cleanse themselves after their journey. I see a young man I recognize from chiropractic school in waking life. He\\u2019s very kind and he\\u2019s with me. We find a little spot to lie down and rest for the night. In the morning, they start breaking down this entryway to the festival. I tell them about my missing bag and shoes. The guy is really helpful and is looking on the upper and lower levels. He says he thinks he saw my shoes and may have seen my backpack, too. He\\u2019s looking for me and telling other people to help me look. But they don\\u2019t find either thing. I decide to go on and know I\\u2019ll find the group of people I\\u2019m supposed to meet up with soon enough. Instead I find this beautiful big grassy field and a rope swing. I\\u2019m excited to see this. I climb up the rope and I start to swing. I\\u2019m looking across the green grass and seeing all the festival stands. People are setting up and selling chai and delicious food and arts and crafts. I see a man I recognize from college. There was an attraction in college of him towards me, but nothing developed. I\\u2019m swinging and then I wave at him and I do this marvelous huge swing that ends in a backflip. I land on my two feet with such strength and grace. He looks and applauds. He\\u2019s laughing and walks along. I\\u2019m looking for my bag again because it has my money and tent supplies. I don\\u2019t find it, but I do end up going to a bathhouse where I find some of the people from my group. They are chiropractic colleagues in waking life. They're so happy to see me and say, \\u201cOh Viviane, you can stay! We have an extra space in the master bedroom we rented for the weekend.\\u201d But I think I\\u2019m going to have to pay for this and I don\\u2019t have the money. I am happy to see them. Then I\\u2019m wandering through the festival and I\\u2019d love a chai, but I don\\u2019t have the money. I end up walking out of the festival along a neighborhood path and I see big houses. All of the houses have been turned into communes. People are living together and that\\u2019s how they can afford to live in this area of town and they\\u2019ve turned this nice area into a community based on communal living homes.\"],[\"Left the house and forget my mask\"],[\"Life of Pi- Me seeing Pi in the ocean, I see things from his perspective.\"],[\"Like I can Identify the person in my dream but they can sometimes mix with a person I be having some crazy dreams still not sure if all this normal yet .

There is a big gathering at a retreat center. We\\u2019ve been here before in dreamtime. Before it was a lot more spacious with only two big beds in each of the rooms. Now there are five smaller beds in one room and women are getting settled in their beds. I go in with my son and we say hello. He climbs up on the different beds. I recognize one person as a patient of mine in waking life. We go into a room we\\u2019ve stayed in before. Instead of two beds, this room now has four. I look for mine. I see my friend Dee. People are talking about the pluses and minuses of this new situation. It\\u2019s less expensive at least. We go downstairs to a packing and shipping operation. We are being forced into this labor. It\\u2019s a Facebook meets Amazon thing. The man is showing us what we need to do. A crane is lifting a huge heavy box filled with rubber masks. It brings it to a truck to be shipped. Now we are all made to sit at our stations and are then given a box of cardboard envelopes. We are supposed to open the box and remove the ten envelopes. I open an envelope, stuff it with a rubber mask and a flyer with the image of an American flag, then lick the flap, seal it closed and put it in another box. We are all doing this. I\\u2019m nearly done with my box when I get to an envelope that is deformed. The flap is difficult to open - it\\u2019s wrinkled and torn. Once I put the mask in the envelope, I have a really hard time closing it and sealing it. I\\u2019m concerned that they\\u2019ll come by and look at my work and my work will be unacceptable. I have a sense of my grandmother\\u2019s presence for a bit, but then she moves on. They do come by and give me this look and make a note on their clipboard, so now I\\u2019m being watched more carefully. Then we are ushered over to a grassy hill, like an outdoor amphitheater. I see Dee again. I also see John Friend sitting on the grass with a couple young women on either side. The women have these sour judgmental looks on their faces. I find it curious that he\\u2019s here in the audience. This is a teaching conference and it seems he\\u2019s there to cause disruption and discontent and questioning of the new authority. Somehow because of his presence and the women on his sides, there is less order.

A thin woman in her sixties with short grey hair. She is a librarian. She was once a student but didn\\u2019t finish her studies because of the danger to her family. She stays close to the students and books, quietly watching out for them and absorbing all of the information in the Records. This is a university in the sky. A younger woman, a student, feels something, knows something. She is at the library searching for safety in knowledge. The older woman steps out from behind the bookshelves and her silent observation to assist. They are both now falling/flying through the clouds. Now, darkness on a river, water black because of night. The older woman is there but no longer directly involved. The younger woman is in the river with the men. So much activity. Men are being trained for dangerous physical labor. She is in with them. Huge pumpkins and watermelons are being poured into the water. They have to sort them quickly so they need to be as close as possible, but that means they are in danger of their heads being smashed and their bodies drowned. Once sorted, the pumpkins and melons float down the river. She is floating alongside a man now. The man has also just arrived and is being trained. They have separated from the rest. They look down and see far below them a family of orcas. They are trying to be as still as possible as they stay afloat. They don\\u2019t want the orcas to notice them, but they also know they\\u2019ve been seen. More orcas arrive. There are so many and the water is so deep! To their right, the rest of the people are now skimming by on extremely fast pointed black boards. Those people know the dangers of the water and have been properly trained and prepared.

Then we realize that it\\u2019s a really dangerous thing we\\u2019ve done - waking him up. He\\u2019s now after us with a gun. I run downstairs and move a bench out of the way next to a bed and shimmy under the bed. I\\u2019m hiding there and I can see under the bed that it\\u2019s dusty with moth balls.

It\\u2019s really early morning and dark - the sun has started to rise.\"],[\"My dream was like a full on sci-fi movie starring Ryan Renolds. It starts out with us in outer space and there are aliens who are trying to bomb the earth or blow up the entire universe. The drama is high. Everyone is in panic and fight or flight mode. I think I\\u2019m on a ship. We\\u2019re trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. Ryan Renolds is trying to come up with a plan. There are a ton of people and I don\\u2019t know any of them. They are the movie extras. I don\\u2019t think I see the aliens, I just see their ships through a spaceship window. The plan includes getting ahold of these two units that will blow something up - very typical movie bullshit. I\\u2019m on the ship. There are a couple ships in the fleet. All of the ships fly at superspeed. They\\u2019re flying through the planets in our solar system, so we\\u2019re whizzing by Mars and Venus, then you see Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. I think the goal is to get to Jupiter or Saturn and blow up one of them. So, this is the scene. Then just like in the movies, the movie cuts away to Earth because we\\u2019re all trying to save Earth. The sky on Earth is a blood red - it looks like how the sky looked when all the smoke was around. I\\u2019m on the street suddenly and Ryan Renolds is with me. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m actually interacting with him or not. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m silently following him at first. I guess I\\u2019m the girlfriend character in the movie and he\\u2019s talking with me. We\\u2019re on the streets of Earth and I look up and see the sky is red. I keep seeing all these white parachutes falling - it\\u2019s the people who were on the spaceships. They\\u2019re coming home so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. They\\u2019re all ejecting out of space and coming down to Earth for one last goodbye to all the people they love. In the meantime, Ryan is still trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. They\\u2019re trying to find the hole in their plans or where their weak spot is. There\\u2019s a scene with the parachutes falling and I\\u2019m listening to him talk and figure something out. Then the scene cuts away to what looks like Mission Control. There\\u2019s a woman reading a screen monitor. At one point, I remember seeing Ryan type into this computer: \\u201cHappy Birthday!\\u201d When he does that, all the aliens who were of one hive mind, suddenly say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my birthday, it\\u2019s my birthday! Happy birthday to me! No, it\\u2019s my birthday!\\u201d And this is just filling up the screen with all the aliens all talking to each other. Also, this woman at Mission Control whose computer this is realizes that all of the aliens look like humans and have been on Earth this whole time and now all of a sudden they\\u2019re fragmenting out into individuals because Ryan typed this one thing into the computer. She\\u2019s sitting back and laughing because she\\u2019s unlocked the key of whatever it is we need to know about them. Then, the scene goes back to me and Ryan. Now a lot of time has passed since he typed \\u201cHappy Birthday\\u201d into the computer. He and I are running through the streets of a city. The people speak English. Somebody is trying to catch him. I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s these aliens disguised as humans or humans helping aliens or humans who are idiots. But there\\u2019s a cop looking person. The uniform is slightly different than a cop uniform. It\\u2019s almost like they have different rights as a cop - more rights. They are trying to catch Ryan. I\\u2019m a little further away from him now. I\\u2019m not sure why. The cop starts to beat him up with a billy club. There\\u2019s a bunch of other people with the cop who are also trying to beat him up. I\\u2019m pissed off. He\\u2019s fighting back. I run over there. They dropped him. He\\u2019s immobilized. They start to wrap him in a plastic sheet with a couple layers and then a blanket. I get to them and start swinging enough to clear the space. They back up away from me. I unwrap Ryan and his left shoulder is totally dislocated and looks terrible. I pop it back in for him. Then I pull him. We start to head off. I\\u2019m threatening these people the whole time like, \\u201cFuck off. I will fuck you up.\\u201d The funny thing is when I was throwing the punches, it was very very unskilled and I couldn\\u2019t have hurt anybody, yet they backed away. So it\\u2019s kind of like they were just letting me do it. The lucid part of my mind is like, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t fight for shit! You need to learn how to fight!\\u201d I go back into the dream and Ryan and I start running. The cop is yelling some bullshit at us as we go and I\\u2019m ignoring it, but part of me is wondering why they are letting us go because I wasn\\u2019t such a good fighter. And why did they just rough Ryan up and then let us run off? It doesn\\u2019t make any sense. Then Ryan realizes there\\u2019s one other thing he needs to do to help things.

Then I\\u2019m in a big hotel. My husband has engaged the services of a male escort. He\\u2019s really looking forward to this man because he\\u2019s a very good kisser. But the man\\u2019s body is so distorted - he\\u2019s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I\\u2019m not happy about the situation but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He\\u2019s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we\\u2019re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I\\u2019m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it\\u2019s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can\\u2019t recall much more. Then we\\u2019re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter. I\\u2019m really upset that he\\u2019s breathing on me and that these people walked into our dining room obviously sick and just off a plane or boat. The scene shifts. I\\u2019m outside walking along a marina. There is shallow water with rocks like tidepools. I look down into the water and see two black and white cats curled together in a circle. They are all wet. I think it\\u2019s odd that the cats are so pleasantly sleeping floating on the water. I keep walking and see a couple drenched yellow chicks. I wonder if they\\u2019ve drowned or if they\\u2019re also sleeping. Then I see a turkey struggling on its back in the water between rocks. I see pigs doing the same along with some other animals. It\\u2019s a very odd scene.\"],[\"My little brown wallet has gone missing, maybe I have lost it?....Then, lots of people at the party are doing things with their phones\\u2026.Augmented reality?....a well-dressed black man and woman, a couple, are looking at abstract shapes and outlines in the air\\u2026.I can see some of the white lines, making various geometric shapes\\u2026.it is a cool and impressive technology, but is it real?....it feels somehow moving in the wrong direction\\u2026.\"],[\"My mom getting coronavirus\"],[\"My mom is standing with her shins next to a child\\u2019s trampoline. In the middle of the trampoline is a pile of things that she is not aware of. She is looking around the room. I look down and see two snakes. At first I assume they are just plastic. They are both black, yellow and red. One is primarily yellow, the other is primarily red. Then I look more carefully and see they are alive. I stop for a moment and think this is impossible. But they are both stretching out towards my mom and one has its tongue out as if tasting the air around her leg. Then I realize they are alive and I urge my mom to stand back because these snakes are alive. She quickly moves back. Then, we realize it\\u2019s a test of some kind. One snake is poisonous and the other is not. Which one is poisonous? We are trying to remember by their markings. In another scene, I\\u2019m with Pema upstairs in my home (it shares some similarities with my current apartment, but not entirely). The banisters are overgrown with lavender, but it's growing as a vine. We are talking about family dynamics, particularly our parents\\u2019 dynamics. She tells me that her mom told her that her dad would never leave because it\\u2019s too complicated. Somehow, her saying this reassures me. Then someone comes and ties back the lavender with bungee cords to tame it and help guide its growth, so it doesn\\u2019t overcrowd the hallway. It looks more beautiful now. I\\u2019m upstairs for a while, then I notice new decorations on the wall - carved wood. I go downstairs and see it was some kind of Christmas day. My dad and my sister are sitting on the couch, and there\\u2019s a man with bright red hair sitting on the floor. They\\u2019re watching a movie on the projector screen. They have just opened presents. The guy asks my sister about the origin story of her daughter\\u2019s name. She starts to cry because it is such a poignant story. She says, \\u201cI wonder if I can just write it on paper? Then I wouldn\\u2019t cry so much.\\u201d The guy steps away to give her space. She starts to cry those soft tears of memory. We are all waiting for her to tell the story of her daughter\\u2019s name. In another scene I see two swans stepping into the water.

I go over to get in with him and see there is shit everywhere in the water. It\\u2019s not his. It was just floating in the tub. There are other people in the hot tub - random people from a dance company. They are talking about their dance company. They ask me why I haven\\u2019t left the company that I\\u2019ve joined yet. They ask, \\u201cHasn\\u2019t it been enough? Why do you still stay?\\u201d I step in to try and get my son out. He submerses himself under the water. Now it\\u2019s worse because I\\u2019m afraid he could be ingesting this poop water. There\\u2019s a moment of panic when I try to get him from under the water. He\\u2019s younger than he is now - probably 9 months or so. I scoop him up out of the water. The poop has not only been stirred up in the water, but is now stuck to my legs, arms and hands. I\\u2019m trying to keep hold of my son while washing the shit off. It\\u2019s turned into a facial mask consistency - slimy and fully stuck on me. I\\u2019m absolutely disgusted. I get out and I still have this on me. We have to get dressed. Now we\\u2019re walking down a street through a neighborhood to downtown. There are a lot of other people walking on the street, too - actually walking in the middle of the street because it has been closed to vehicle traffic. There are quite a few homeless people with shopping carts and random plastic bags of things loitering around and quite dirty. We have to stop at a stoplight. Then we keep on going. We end up at a food stand and order food to go. I\\u2019m with my husband and my son now. They give us our food in a to-go bag. The plastic bag has a knot in the top to hold it closed and trying not to touch more of it because I don\\u2019t know how clean the bag is and I don't want to contaminate the food. I don\\u2019t want to be contaminated and I don\\u2019t want to contaminate the food, myself. We keep on walking and end up at a food truck place with multiple vendors. At one stand, they are doing a cooking demonstration. They are making an amazing wrap with long filets of salmon and cucumber and a wonderful lemongrass sauce. They are demonstrating the creation of this food. My son and I are watching as my husband goes to wash his hands. I\\u2019m holding the other food and regretting that we bought it before we knew about this food. The salmon dish looks delicious. I notice my husband has been gone for a long time. I go looking for him. I can\\u2019t find him anywhere. Finally I see a round table with all our stuff on it - our wet clothes laid out on the table and over the chairs. Our bag is on the chair, too. I\\u2019m relieved to see that the clothes are out to dry.

I was driving a red convertible to the ocean again, I was with my ex Rory and his friends. We found a place to sit down on a patch of rocks on the water\\u2019s edge and there was a young black man right next to us and I couldn\\u2019t take my eyes off him, I knew him, the one from my other dreams.

I feel like I know you.\\u201d He introduced himself quietly and smiled so I saw all his teeth but I don\\u2019t remember his name. His voice was so kind. He took off his baseball cap and put it on my head over my straw hat, and nestled it in to make sure it was on there. He said something about there\\u2019s only eight groups of us at this beach. Then he got in the water. Then Rory and I decided we were hungry, debating between tacos and lobster rolls so we started walking on this decrepit but very crowded boardwalk. We saw lots of artists, lots of homeless people. One woman was sitting in a wheelchair; her face was painted grayish white but her lips were moving and I asked if she was okay but she didn\\u2019t answer and everyone kept walking by. She was dying slowly right there invisible but how could you miss her. It was like her body was 95 perfectly entombed. Then the waves started to come at first splashed through the boardwalk and then bigger where we had to hold onto the railings. Then we turned to leave and the waves kept coming and washing out the boardwalk in every direction, the railing was not sturdy; there were areas it was replaced with children safety gates and didn\\u2019t feel sustainable and I held on by the tips of my fingers and felt the water lift the rest of my body up and thought I couldn\\u2019t hold on any longer. People were just holding on wave after wave and we were losing each other but I wasn\\u2019t panicked because I let my body just float when it needed to float and move when it could. The people with their feet on the ground kept getting knocked over. I shouted to let go, let go and hold on hands only but they didn\\u2019t listen. After what felt like forever, it stopped. I walked along the inside of the artist areas and people were in there with water on the floor but otherwise unaffected. A group of white young women wearing all white shirts and green shorts came in perfectly dry and complaining loudly that they weren\\u2019t letting people in because of the waves and I really gave it to them. I let them know about the severity of the ordeal and they needed to be careful too if they were going down there. They didn\\u2019t seem to care that people just died. They just shrugged their shoulders. Then my father in law was at the boardwalk and we were checking out all of the art and he turned to me and said \\u201clet\\u2019s get a tattoo!\\u201d In real life this is something he has been telling me about as a memory of his son, my late husband.\"],[\"nightmares- paying for 5 years in future- 25k\"],[\"no\"],[\"None\"],[\"Not a movie, but I'd seen a program about cars of the past....and saw one of the first cars I'd ever owned.

There are also two green magnets. She\\u2019s telling me how to read the collage for the ceremony. She moves the magnets around, so one magnet is at the beginning of the reading and the other shows where to stop reading. As we are looking, it sort of makes sense. I hold out the paper and begin, but as I\\u2019m reading, the collage changes size, the magnets move, the words turn into Spanish and others turn into Sunday morning type cartoons.

I don\\u2019t know if their professors or the actual astronauts find us in their office. We snuck in. there\\u2019s a sense that we shouldn\\u2019t be there. They come in. It's two or three of the astronauts who are also teachers. They sit down and I can tell they know what we\\u2019re trying to do and there\\u2019s no way in hell it\\u2019s going to happen. But they indulge us. They are asking the kids all these questions: \\u201cHow are you going to do this, this and this? How are you going to take care of this? What food are you going to eat? The food question is funny because we\\u2019re all actually eating food and some of the kids are wanting to share the food with the astronauts. I can tell that the other kids are not aware that these teachers are the actual astronauts. They haven\\u2019t put that together yet. I\\u2019m watching all of this and also in the conversation and offering some of my food to one of the astronauts even though I know they\\u2019re going to say no. the reason they\\u2019re asking all these questions is that at some point they\\u2019re going to say we can\\u2019t do all this stuff because we\\u2019re not prepared. We are sitting around a rounded desk. This goes on for a while. The scene changes. We never get on a spaceship or anything. The teachers/astronauts never say, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re not going,\\u201d or \\u201cYou\\u2019re in trouble for breaking into the office.\\u201d I keep waiting for that to happen and it doesn\\u2019t happen. It\\u2019s like the astronauts are so bemused by the excitement and enthusiasm of the kids that they let it play out. Then I am hanging with Johnny and Amanda again - I\\u2019ve known both of them since second grade. They were married seven or eight years ago and now have a couple kids. Johnny is the leader again. He has a group of people with him. I don\\u2019t recognize all the people, but I do see Amanda there. He\\u2019s pretty upbeat and everybody is excited to be there. We are outside in my backyard somehow. At one point, I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s moving around the crowd. He comes to me and picks me up. We\\u2019re holding hands and our arms are locked. I\\u2019m using all of my muscles to stay upright. He\\u2019s moving me around like in acroyoga. I am thinking how this takes a lot of shoulder strength to hold me up like this. It takes a lot of shoulder strength on my end to hold myself up like this, too! Everybody is having a good time. Then suddenly it\\u2019s time to go. It\\u2019s time to move on. It\\u2019s time for Johnny to move his group of people and I\\u2019m with them. Now I have a pair of roller skates on. There are a couple other other moms in this group as well, and they also have roller skates on. There are younger kids with roller skates on. There are moms wearing their kids. I think Amanda is wearing a baby. I watch them go. I think I should also grab my tennis shoes in case we have to go uphill or we have to go inside where roller skates are not a good idea. So I\\u2019m watching them go and decide to go with them first because I want to see where they go. I forget to get my shoes. I can feel how fast I\\u2019m gliding in these roller skates and it\\u2019s a lot of fun. There are other moms in this group. I\\u2019m at the back of the crowd. We are skating down streets but the streets are cracked and there\\u2019s grass growing up out of the streets. So it\\u2019s not super smooth. I realize I really do need to get my shoes. The group is going really slow so I do have time to skate back to my place and grab my shoes. Wherever we\\u2019re going, we are leaving these places for good. We aren\\u2019t coming back. I leave the group and it kind of feels a little bit painful but I know I\\u2019ll be able to find them because I\\u2019m on roller skates and I\\u2019m going faster than they are. I know I\\u2019ll be able to hear them. So I roller skate back to my house up this hill. I\\u2019m going really fast. I grab my tennis shoes and put them in this backpack. Instead of going the way I came with the group, I cut across all of these streets. The streets remind me of the streets around the college I went to - residential area for college students and professors. There are tall trees. The cracks in the sidewalk are still there. Things look kind of old and there is ivy growing on things. There are lots of flowers on the lawns. Then I get to an apartment complex with multiple levels. All of these levels are connected by stairs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, stairs and roller skates, not going to happen.\\u201d So I put my tennis shoes on. I can hear the group. Johnny is shepherding them at this point. My friend Ikaika who I have also known since second grade and grew up with is now in the group, too. They\\u2019re trying to go up one of the sets of stairs on the outside of the apartment building. There is a younger woman - well, she\\u2019s the same age as everyone in the group, we\\u2019re all younger than we are in real life, maybe in our twenties or early thirties. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, you cannot take this entire group through this apartment complex and go up these stairs.\\u201d It\\u2019s interesting because the streets I\\u2019m on are two or three levels above where the group is trying to climb the stairs to get up to these streets. So they\\u2019re definitely at a lower level of the road or something. Johnny is trying to bring them up the stairs and Ikaika is trying as well. Those two are super frustrated. I go and talk to the young woman. But I have to go through somebody\\u2019s apartment. It\\u2019s a college apartment so there are four people crammed into this tiny apartment and this is why the woman is saying, \\u201cNo, stop trying to bring this group of people up through this. It\\u2019s small and there\\u2019s not enough room for them! And you\\u2019re disturbing all of us who live here. You\\u2019re not taking into account the fact that we live here. You are singing loudly. You have kids. You have roller skates on.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her and she is pissed off. She\\u2019s not having it. She has blond hair down to her shoulders. Her skin is tan. She looks a bit ratty, not well kept. I go to talk to Johnny and Ikaika and say, \\u201cYou guys, we can go around. We don\\u2019t need to go through these peoples\\u2019 homes to get up to this next level.\\u201d They are so frustrated. They can\\u2019t see any other way than to come up the stairs. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, lets\\u2019 go around. There\\u2019s a road over here you can go up.\\u201d The dream ends here at an impasse with all these people trying to come up and this one girl trying to keep them out. I\\u2019m trying to convince them to go up around this road. No one arrives at a solution.\"],[\"The last dream I saw my old friend Luke in the parking lot and he asked where I\\u2019ve been and invited me to a party on a train. I got to the party and it was like boxcar apartments on the train and everyone was playing guitar. There was some kind of game or guitar competition, but it was really crowded and while it looked fun, I just wanted to get off the moving train and away from all of these people, mostly men. Something about it didn\\u2019t feel safe.\"],[\"The last dream: I was with someone who represented a former boyfriend and we were late to get to a circus in Monterey.

It feels like a hotel in that there is a large foyer with a front desk and a person who assigns rooms and provides plastic card keys. It feels like an apartment in that people are more permanently ehre and the rooms have a kitchen, sitting room and are decorated according to people\\u2019s unique tastes. At first I am in my own room. Then I go to a gathering in another room. I\\u2019m meeting with a group of people - some who were in my Gaelic language class - and others also from the town where I live. There\\u2019s consternation about the growth of the town. When the meeting is over, people go their separate ways. I\\u2019m supposed to teach a private yoga lesson. My client has purchased this for her fiance. I\\u2019m trying to find him. There\\u2019s an older lady from the meeting who delays me. She carries magic, crone wisdom, and seeing skills. She wants to ask me questions and get a read of me. I want to have this connection with her, yet at the same time I need to keep my appointment - a zoom call. It\\u2019s getting really close to the start time of the class. She brings me into the kitchen and asks me questions. I\\u2019m uncomfortable with the conversation and hoping I\\u2019m giving satisfactory answers. I feel out of place. I am now late for my appointment. I\\u2019m trying to be present with her and maintain my obligations and somehow let him know I\\u2019m running late because I know he\\u2019s waiting. Finally, it\\u2019s fifteen minutes past the hour and she nods to release me. I\\u2019m trying to get to my room so I can start the lesson. When I get to my room, there are other movement instructors in my room and signing in their classes on my computer. They\\u2019ve created excel spreadsheets and downloaded new programs on my computer desktop. I\\u2019m trying to close those down but not disturb their process. I\\u2019m also annoyed they\\u2019ve taken over my computer for their own purposes. I\\u2019m also uneasy that so many people are passing through my rooms to get to the studio. After all this messing around, I finally sign in. He\\u2019s not there. I see that he has checked in eight different times but has given up. I\\u2019m disappointed at letting him down. Time passes. I\\u2019m looking at a map of a river and structures being built along the river. Somehow I see people on bicycles riding up and down. I also see fires being started as well. I don\\u2019t know if the fires are started by people or nature. We are sending out crews of people to discover what\\u2019s happening and put out the fires.\"],[\"THe shipped in rioters and those that burned and looted buildings regardless of what race owned it.

Maybe the youngest is 5 or 6 and it goes up to teenagers. They are ice skaters and they\\u2019re all practicing to put on a show. I\\u2019m watching the instructors teach them. There is something missing in the instruction. The dances are sloppy - their lines aren't straight, they\\u2019re not finishing their movements, and it just doesn\\u2019t look good. The teachers are hard and harsh with their instruction. You can see on the faces of the kids that they don\\u2019t like it. So I\\u2019m hired as a strength and conditioning coach. I end up taking a different role where I invite the kids to a stage - sort of like an opera house. It\\u2019s all wood and they\\u2019re ice skating on the wood. I don\\u2019t know how this is possible. However, I invite them, \\u201cHey, come work out with me. We\\u2019re going to make you guys stronger. Why don\\u2019t you guys show me your dances so I can see.\\u201d As I\\u2019m watching, I realize they aren\\u2019t in it. They don\\u2019t have 100% commitment to the dance they\\u2019re putting on, to the movements they\\u2019re making. They are just sort of half-assing everything. So I\\u2019m giving them a pep talk: \\u201cYou guys have to commit to making this dance happen. You have to commit to be in the spot you\\u2019re in so the line is straight. Or you have to extend your leg and your arm. You have to really go for that jump. Give it as much as you\\u2019ve got.\\u201d While I\\u2019m giving this talk, they\\u2019re nodding at me and smiling. You can feel the energy shift. Now they\\u2019re motivated to do it. They go back out to dance and they\\u2019re doing much better. I have this feeling that the other instructors are pissed off at me for doing that, like I had stepped out of my role and my position and overstepped their boundaries. Part of me is like, \\u201cYou should have told them that.\\u201d The other part of me is like, \\u201cOh gosh, now I might not have a job.\\u201d So I\\u2019m in a very interesting place, kind of like fuck you and fuck it. It\\u2019s more important to me to see these kids light up and shine because they\\u2019re very, very talented skaters. I want them to show people what they know how to do. Then it shifts. I\\u2019m with a friend of mine. She and I are hungry. We\\u2019re going to go eat at a restaurant. We\\u2019re walking down a boardwalk by the sea. The sea is to our right. We\\u2019re walking towards a shack at the end of this boardwalk that is a restaurant. There are tall pilings. It\\u2019s above sea water but right there at the edge of the ocean. There are seagulls and I can feel the salt spray because it is a bit windy. We are bundled up. We walk out to this sea shack of a restaurant. We sit down and start to order. I have this fizzy drink that looks like an energy drink can. I have it in my hand. She is teasing me about something I said earlier and she\\u2019s using a funny voice. It\\u2019s cracking me up but I\\u2019m also feeling kind of embarrassed. But it\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s funny. So we\\u2019re at our table and order. I spill the energy drink. She and I are sitting down. I have four books in my lap. The two of us are looking at these books. One is an embroidery book. It\\u2019s important because there\\u2019s a group of women at a table across from us. My friend and I are going through these books, downloading information from these four books. The books are still in my lap and the women look at the two books on top of the pile side by side. They say, \\u201cOh, those are good books.\\u201d When I remove the top two and they look at the two underneath, one of which is the embroidery book, the women get super judgmental and say, \\u201cWell, those books are crap!\\u201d My friend and I are thinking but don\\u2019t actually say out loud: \\u201cOh, okay, well no one asked you. We weren\\u2019t even talking to you, but thank you for interjecting yourself into our conversation.\\u201d We say something pleasant, \\u201cUh huh, thanks for your feedback.\\u201d Then at this point, I\\u2019ve already spilled the energy drink once and it gets cleaned up. But then I spill it again. I make a much bigger mess this time. It\\u2019s an energy drink and is all sticky and it smells like strawberry. I\\u2019m not actually drinking it, just apparently holding it and spilling it on the floor. Now I\\u2019m embarrassed. I get up to find a mop. I ask the cook and one of the servers. The cook is my brother and the manager is my other brother. They point me to the cleaning closet. I get the mop and go to mop it up, but it\\u2019s already been moped up. I look up and am like, \\u201cWho cleaned this up?\\u201d It was the server that I\\u2019d passed. He said, \\u201cI already cleaned it up once already, so I just cleaned it up a second time.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m feeling bad because I\\u2019ve made a mess twice and someone else has cleaned it up twice and it is a sticky mess. I think I\\u2019m hungry and we haven\\u2019t gotten our food. But I\\u2019m ready to just go.\"],[\"There are a bunch of kids that I\\u2019m in charge of somehow. I\\u2019m a caretaker, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure how - I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m their mother or not. I\\u2019m needing to get them to a safer place. I have a little bit of help. There are hallways where I\\u2019m trying to gather them up from and get them on a bus so they can be in a safer spot. I\\u2019m really clear that I don\\u2019t want that responsibility. I\\u2019m going to make sure they get where they need to go, but after that the choices I make are going to have a lot less to do with being their caretaker 24/7. These are not my kids. These are just random children. I can't tell if it\\u2019s a school or daycare or something. It\\u2019s everybody\\u2019s children, but they are not of my body. So, there are other people around who are also caretaking them and trying to get them to wherever they need to go. There\\u2019s just this feeling of needing to get them to a safe place. We get them somewhere, but I drift out of the scene somehow. I end up trying to find a home for myself. My beloved is with me now. We\\u2019re looking at houses - they are the same houses we were looking for for the kids. We were looking at a dormitory or something for them to live in. i\\u2019m looking for a house for myself. I\\u2019m clear that I only want enough house for me and one other person to come stay with me whenever they want. They find a cute house. I can only see the inside of it. It\\u2019s in a neighborhood kind of like the one I grew up in, but I can't really see the outside of it. There are cute cupboards. There isn\\u2019t a lot of space because it\\u2019s just me. There is a lot of wood paneling on the inside. I\\u2019m trying to decide if I\\u2019m going to be there. Then we go out of the house and all of a sudden there\\u2019s water everywhere - ocean. I\\u2019m collecting shells and I can see down to the bottom of the ocean. It\\u2019s really clear. I\\u2019m trying to collect the shells and I drop one and watch it sink down to the bottom. I\\u2019m trying to gauge the depth of the water based on how small the item looks, but water magnifies it so i can\\u2019t tell the true depth of the water. So I\\u2019m looking at this one shell that I dropped which then turns into a shoe. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not my shoe. I don\\u2019t want the shoe, I want my shell. The shells are prettier.\\u201d My beloved is there and he\\u2019s helping me collect these shells and I have a few. Then the scene morphs. That one shoe takes me to another scene. I\\u2019m carrying bags of trash. It\\u2019s actually not trash - it\\u2019s stuff I\\u2019m getting rid of, all these clothes and things I used to have or need but now I don\\u2019t. It includes pairs of shoes. The trash bags go in the trashcan and the pairs of shoes go on top of the trashcan. I\\u2019m back in a neighborhood again and I\\u2019m taking the trash over to my neighbor\\u2019s house so she can look at it. I take out one bag of trash and only one shoe, one of my snow boots. I go get another bag of stuff and the other boot goes on top of the can. Then I get a third bag and there\\u2019s one more shoe - I don\\u2019t remember what kind of shoe. I see these three shoes and then all of a sudden I\\u2019m done with this and want to dance. I want to dance like the way break dancers dance with all body weight and where you go upside down a lot. But I\\u2019m not very good at it. This area where I was taking the trash bags to changes into an amphitheatre with no walls. There are lights being projected. I\\u2019m moving my body and it\\u2019s really awkward in the beginning. My body hurts, I don\\u2019t have the strength for some of the moves, I can\\u2019t think of some of the moves I want to do, I don\\u2019t have much flow and my body is really jerky. At some point I see myself in a mirror - these mirrors have shown up as part of the walls even though it\\u2019s a completely outdoor space. I have short deep auburn red hair. At one point, scratches appear on my back. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no no, we\\u2019re not going that direction!\\u201d I somehow wipe the scratches off my back as an observer, then I go back into my body and try to dance. I think there\\u2019s part of me that is still in the observer role because I\\u2019m watching myself dance in the mirror. Suddenly the mirrors turn a brilliant turquoise blue. They become the background. There\\u2019s also granite rock mountains in the back. I feel something click in my body and brain and I let go. I\\u2019m suddenly dancing fluidly and my body becomes a lot more muscular. I suddenly have the musculature to be upside down and doing handstands with splits and backflips and a lot of break dance moves where you spin on your shoulders and flip in the air. My legs are really strong. Everything is really really strong. This background of turquoise teal blue is bright like an electric vibrant brightness and the granite rock is reflected in the mirror somehow with me also reflected in the mirror doing dances to some music I can hear.\"],[\"There are a number of women - I actually don\\u2019t know any of them. They seem younger than me, although we're all in our early or late twenties, but my perspective feels older as if I\\u2019ve had more life experience than your average 20 year old. We are in a school of some sort, like a college, but it\\u2019s a compound - there\\u2019s buildings everywhere. We are all at a fashion show. We have gone into this really big room. It has floor to ceiling windows. We\\u2019re trying on all the different items we are going to be wearing to walk the catwalk. It\\u2019s a lingerie fashion show. The thing is, some of the other girls who are younger than me, their choices of lingerie are not particularly revealing, which I don\\u2019t have any thoughts around. But my choices are. I\\u2019m wearing a black lace super cheeky booty short bottoms and the top is see-through lace and midriff. One of the girls is like, \\u201cAre you going to wear that?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s a fashion show. Yes. It\\u2019s like Victoria\\u2019s Secret. We just walk down the catwalk showing off the clothes.\\u201d There\\u2019s a little bit of shame in her voice and I contract for a second and put a corset on over. It\\u2019s interesting this corset has sleeves. Then I look down and see that I\\u2019ve put the sleeved corset on underneath the black lacy thing, so you can see the black lacy thing on top. The corset is on below. I\\u2019ve also put on a skirt to cover up the black bottoms, but the bottoms are black and the skirt is an almost see-through light pink, so you can still see the bottoms. So I put that on and am like, \\u201cOkay, this is better. I guess.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there watching some of the other girls walk down the catwalk, and then think, \\u201cNo, this isn\\u2019t better. This isn\\u2019t what I want to wear. This isn\\u2019t me.\\u201d So I take off the bottoms and I take off the corset - I just sort of rip it off, although the sleeves stay on, which is weird because I have to take the sleeves off separately. Then I\\u2019m back in what I was wearing previously with just the black lace and it feels way better. We are inside right now, but we are all still milling about because it\\u2019s not time for the show yet. Then we get the word that we\\u2019re actually going to show the last piece of clothing that we\\u2019re all wearing outside. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo way! It is freezing. It is below freezing. It is so cold outside. We can\\u2019t go out there in our lingerie.\\u201d So I find a coat and put some of the other layers - the corset goes back on. I go to the outside area where we are all supposed to be showing what we\\u2019re wearing. I realize I don\\u2019t have any boots on and my feet are going to freeze. So me and another friend stop and we swing by our dormitory room. I go in and grab some of my fur-lined boots. As I\\u2019m heading out to walk out to this place, some of the girls comment and say, \\u201cNever mind, they cancelled that. It\\u2019s too cold.\\u201d I am relieved. They say, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s time for us to go to the cafeteria,\\u201d or someplace - it\\u2019s a big gathering area where there\\u2019s a ton of us. Now I\\u2019m wearing a very interesting hodgepodge of clothes, but it doesn\\u2019t matter because it\\u2019s time to eat and I\\u2019m hungry. So I follow them to this dining area. Up until this point there were only women in the dream, but now there\\u2019s men, too. There\\u2019s men and women all gathering in this communal area where there\\u2019s food available. I\\u2019m going through the line, trying to decide what to eat and I\\u2019m starving. I\\u2019ve ordered a lot of food. I have my tray and I\\u2019m putting it on my tray. There\\u2019s a friend of mine who\\u2019s with me - it\\u2019s a guy and I don\\u2019t recognize him, but he is somebody I know, somebody I am familiar with. I\\u2019m eating, but handing him food because he\\u2019s hungry, too. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, eat some of this.\\u201d He\\u2019s making the comment that I\\u2019m eating so much. I guess that\\u2019s because I'm still wearing these clothes for modeling the lingerie and he\\u2019s commenting on how much I\\u2019m eating. I\\u2019m a little annoyed about that because what the fuck, how much I eat doesn\\u2019t have anything to do with my ability to model lingerie. There\\u2019s not a specific look, either. I\\u2019m just annoyed by the seemingly still narrow definition of beauty. So I actually just walk off after that. I take my food and leave. There\\u2019s a bunch of girls I\\u2019ve been modeling with - they show up and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOkay, now we have to go here and now we have to go here.\\u201d So I\\u2019m kind of trying to follow along. They\\u2019re collecting something for a party and I\\u2019m not sure exactly what it is. They\\u2019re trying to get all of these things in order for the party. This is the part of the dream where it\\u2019s been building, this feeling of being a little on the outside because I'm just not quite in the flow of what they\\u2019re all doing. The stuff they\\u2019re interested in just doesn't quite interest me and the way they do it, I don\\u2019t quite do it that way. This is the point in the dream where it really shows up and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, no, I\\u2019m actually not even interested in what any of you are doing right now, your party or whatever it is. I think I\\u2019m just going to do my own thing. That\\u2019s where I leave and the dream ends.\"],[\"There are four separate interrelated scenes - a really nice apartment condo by the ocean; a little Cobb style house that once belonged to Jeremy; a lovely home and office built around a tree at a retreat center; and a hospital in Hawaii. I am moving into a really nice condo. It\\u2019s modern with new appliances, white walls, high ceilings, big floor to ceiling windows with a view of the ocean from every room. The ocean is choppy and dark, but beautiful. I\\u2019ve never been to New England but it seems like the Atlantic ocean of the northeastern United States. The rent is extremely affordable and I\\u2019m wondering why. I\\u2019m living with a childhood friend (we really only knew each other when I was an infant and he was five) and another woman who comes and goes. We are learning how to live with each other, learning each other\\u2019s rhythms with cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and working. The refrigerator is full of delicious food - produce and prepared meals. I go to see where he is. He\\u2019s napping on a couch with a book across his chest. He has his head towards me then he senses that I\\u2019m there on the couch and he turns his body so his feet are towards me. His knees are open and I feel a warmth and desire awaken in my body. I crawl up towards him and it surprises us both even though there has been an attraction between our souls since the beginning of my life. We go into the kitchen and there is a tentative quality to our interaction now, feeling each other out and this new expression of our relationship. I wrap my legs around him and kiss him. Then for a moment he switches to my dad then switches back. That was weird. But there is a beautiful connection and fluidity in the way we are together. It\\u2019s as if we were made to be together, but waking life circumstances didn\\u2019t work in our favor. Then I learn that the reason this condo is so affordable is because there are cameras everywhere set to film us making love. It\\u2019s like a pornography studio. I don\\u2019t really know what to make of it. But I love being here at the ocean and with him, so it\\u2019s okay. Then, the dream shifts. I am walking by a little Cobb style cottage that was for sale, but now it looks like someone has recently bought it and moved in. I think this house once belonged to Jeremy and Zoe. It\\u2019s really crafty. There are waves carved over the mantel and the front door. It\\u2019s tan and brown, really of the earth. There\\u2019s a wooden fence all around and a little garden. Inside, a fire is burning in the fireplace. Herbs are hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is warm and carved of wood. Everything is just enough and just right. No one is home. I go in through the door in the back and am walking around, curious to see if it feels like home to me. In a way, it does. I make a cup of tea and sit in front of the fire. Then I get a sense that whoever lives here will be returning home soon, so I need to make it look like I wasn\\u2019t there, moving things back and covering up my presence. I leave and walk around the corner past the front. This is when I see this symbolic spiral wave over the front door and I can see through the door and walls to how the design over the mantel is a continuation of this design. I walk away into another scene. I\\u2019m with my mom, dad and sister. We are touring a gorgeous place with a real estate agent. It\\u2019s a home modeled around a huge tree. It\\u2019s built in the round, like a spiral. There\\u2019s a lovely glass sunroom that wraps nearly all around and a deck around that. When you walk in, there\\u2019s the tree trunk, a fireplace and a sitting area with long curving couches designed for this space. A doorway leads to a spacious bedroom which I don\\u2019t go into yet. The home spirals to the right to a beautiful kitchen with an island. It\\u2019s a community kitchen with a pantry stocked full. It continues into a laundry room and a room for the cats. As we are in the kitchen, another group comes in and goes upstairs. The real estate is angry because we now know how public this home is - anyone who lives at the retreat center has full access to this kitchen and to the offices upstairs. There is a recording studio and office with computers and printer upstairs. It is quite loud and we realize it won\\u2019t be a private home. We are still interested though. She shows us through the laundry room to the glass sunroom and cat walk that spirals around the front. It\\u2019s warm and bright and there is a cat lounging in the sun. I love it. She takes us upstairs to this beautiful office. Everything is furnished and lovely. We go back downstairs and into the spacious bedroom. I realize this is an apartment in and of itself. It\\u2019s big and open. There\\u2019s a fireplace where you can roast potatoes in the ashes. There are old fashioned iron stovetops with terracotta pots set on top to radiate warmth into the space. They are cooking a feast of roasted chickens and breads and other kinds of meat and vegetables. It smells so good. I tell my dad, \\u201cHow wonderful would it be to learn how to use these stoves and cook these gorgeous meals?!\\u201d I go down one step to look at the bedroom to see if it will be good for my husband, son and me. There\\u2019s a huge bed. The room feels spacious and it\\u2019s flooded with sunlight. I love it. On the far side of the bedroom is something like a clear plastic tent tarp. Through it I see seven beds lined up against the wall. They are covered with colorful pillows and it\\u2019s so bright and inviting. There\\u2019s a paper with instructions for how to set up the pillows so they all fit. I think how wonderful it would be to invite friends over. I want to negotiate with the realtor about renting just this part of the treehouse, not the whole place. She won\\u2019t get as much of a commission as she wanted, but maybe she\\u2019ll be happy to have something rather than nothing. As we are leaving, we are putting on our shoes on the deck just outside the front door. My dad is trying to be funny. We have the same kind of shoes - brown plastic slippers. He\\u2019s trying to put on one of my shoes but it of course doesn\\u2019t fit. I tell him to give me back my shoe. Then I\\u2019m in a hospital in Hawaii. I\\u2019m partially in a room with a curtain and partially outside. My best friend from middle school is giving birth. They are torturing her, pushing on her stomach, squeezing and twisting. She\\u2019s in so much pain. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do it that way! You\\u2019re hurting her and the baby!\\u201d I think the baby is dead inside her. She\\u2019s exhausted. I\\u2019m also pregnant and giving birth. I won\\u2019t let anyone touch me. I feel my own stomach and the baby\\u2019s head is down and to the left and okay. I\\u2019m watching people rush around because this is an emergency room. A friend from college, is the doctor. I ask him to check me because I think I can trust him not to harm me or my baby. He approaches me tentatively. He is still unsure of himself around me because I rejected him so many years ago. He has a butter knife with what looks like raw ground beef on it. He puts a towel over me and checks. He brings the knife up and there is blood dripping from it onto his nose. There\\u2019s a look in his eyes like, \\u201cThis could have been my baby.\\u201d He is sad about the loss of our friendship and his desire to be in relationship. The labor is continuing and getting stronger. I look out into the city scene. It\\u2019s mostly grey and full of the sounds of a busy city. Through the grey I see bright red and yellow, the colors of Hawaiian royalty. The Hawaiians have joined together with their drums and are playing the rhythm of life, birth and death. I drum along with them on my belly as if my tummy is an ipu. I see one man stand up above the rest with his drum and he\\u2019s so full of vitality and passion. The passion and rhythm are in such contrast to the city, but this is what I tune into - the red and yellow and drums.\"],[\"There are just snippets of this dream that came through. I\\u2019m in the kitchen of my childhood home trying to put dishes away and reorganize the cabinet. My sister\\u2019s there with me. She\\u2019s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she\\u2019s always playing the victim. Then I\\u2019m in a house - it\\u2019s close by my childhood home. There\\u2019s a man living in it who\\u2019s apparently my significant other, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There\\u2019s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he\\u2019s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I\\u2019m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I\\u2019m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There\\u2019s an opera house. It\\u2019s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I\\u2019m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I\\u2019m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There\\u2019s all kinds of magical things in them. It\\u2019s dark up in here and I\\u2019m looking through them. Then I decide it\\u2019s time to leave. Now I\\u2019m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I\\u2019m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There\\u2019s so much snow and I\\u2019m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I\\u2019m driving down, there\\u2019s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn\\u2019t I stop to let them go by, don\\u2019t I know that pedestrians have the right of way. I look at them and I look ahead of me where there\\u2019s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It\\u2019s a small street, I\\u2019m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.\"],[\"There are three or four black women, I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re actresses. They\\u2019re going on stage. One is stunningly beautiful and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who needs to be on stage.\\u201d I keep wanting to build her up and make sure she knows how beautiful she is. For some reason she\\u2019s not seeing how beautiful she is. I\\u2019m trying to convince her through showing her.Then I have berries which look like blueberries. I\\u2019ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don\\u2019t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I\\u2019m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don\\u2019t know who. I\\u2019m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I\\u2019m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it\\u2019s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard. I can see this cartoonish looking town through the branches and it\\u2019s dark and there are lights on. The roads are very hilly and windy.\"],[\"There are three women with complex machines\\u2026.They are angry, they will not work with other people\\u2026.I am curious about them\\u2026.\"],[\"There is a gathering of people. My husband is there. I meet up with Mary to help her out with something.\"],[\"There is a land we must pass through. I\\u2019m with a big group of people. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them from waking life. We get to a point where the tigers are. We\\u2019re strategizing and learning how to get through. We\\u2019re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It\\u2019s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don\\u2019t have anyone to pair off with, so I\\u2019m going through the motions by myself. I\\u2019m also wary of holding people\\u2019s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don\\u2019t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I\\u2019ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don\\u2019t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I\\u2019m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I\\u2019m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties. I\\u2019m sad and disappointed, I feel left out because they haven\\u2019t thought to invite me. I would like to be included.\"],[\"There is a pile of boxes and stuff to be moved\\u2026.I will take care of mine\\u2026.But another pile of boxes is for someone else\\u2026.I wonder if I should go over and help, but I think it will be better if I let them do it themselves\\u2026.\"],[\"There is an operation with water dams - underground controlled waters. One of the dams breaks and the water is flooding. Tons of people are getting caught in the rushing water at the dam. Some are being washed away - children and adults of all ages. I can see them caught under the water. I\\u2019m among the people trying to fix it. Some of us are sitting at the dam, dropping things into the water. Others are trying to pull up and move metal fixtures and objects to stop the water from rushing. One woman at a control panel sees what\\u2019s going on. She strips her shirt off and runs into the water and swims up against the current to try and stop the flow. In another scene, I\\u2019m in my backyard. My neighbors are all walking around the grass. The fence has been broken and they\\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the pieces around to make a solid fence and container for the lawn again. In another scene, I\\u2019m walking up a hill to a mountain village with my son. We are following somebody. We hear a train in the distance. People are trying to stop the train. We are looking for our car. In another scene, we\\u2019ve been given a golden retriever puppy. It\\u2019s nighttime, but we don\\u2019t have a cage for the dog, so we go to a grocery outlet. They are closing up. But we need a dog cage. We end up buying other items. There is one item that goes through and I decide I don\\u2019t want it. We ask if we can return it and they say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s too late. We\\u2019re already past closing.\\u201d So we just decide to take it and come back to return it. Outside there are Latino men with blanket rolls setting up to sleep on the sidewalk for the night. Each of them also has what looks like a wolf head. When I look closely, it\\u2019s an entire white wolf pelt. They each killed their own wolf and made a protective cover for themselves to keep out the cold at night.\"],[\"There was a camp in a new city that I\\u2019d loved where everyone has to audition for which role they would play. There were three options: jock, dancer, cheerleader. I was so nervous because I couldn\\u2019t keep anything straight and I was so damn confused. But I went to the day long try out and got slated to be a dancer which was the best thing you could hope for. I felt honored to have found my place among the elite and most relieved to have found a place and to do my part. A boy was helping me the whole time to be where I needed to be and to remember the moves. He made me immediately feel safe and found and loved. He held onto me and led me and guided me. He has some cut marks on his arms. I touched them and knew his life had been hard and I loved him for that and for making me feel found. He was a good dancer and was so kind. The proctors of the auditions congratulated us and asked how we were going to celebrate and I got on the bus with the boy and my old friend Emily to go see Harry Potter. She told us that we\\u2019d have to remember our part for ten years so to find someone to practice with and I knew I\\u2019d found my person and my place and I felt so good.\"],[\"there was a lot of running outside\"],[\"There was a plane of passengers who were infected that i had to help\"],[\"There was a stranger squatting in the guest house on the far end of my property. The guest house was a little dilapidated and needed lots of work. But there were three beautiful white Lily bushes growing outside of it. It\\u2019s a house I\\u2019ve seen before in a dream. I knew the guy was there but I couldn\\u2019t explain how I knew, I just felt it. No one believed me. I went out one day to confirm my suspicions. I saw the reflection in the window of someone behind me and I turned and no one was there. A tall cowboy western looking guy in a blue flannel. I looked in the window and saw him again and when I turned around he was there with his wife and daughter and they walked away together really floaty and turned around to look at me once. They were ghosts. I was nervous but I went into the house and I saw someone sleeping. I got scared and ran all the way home and he was running behind me. I got inside and closed the door and he stood there begging to talk. So I talked to him and he was actually really nice and asked if he could help fix it up in exchange for living there for a year. I thought that seemed fair. He had a job and was saving all his money to marry his girlfriend. I agreed but didn\\u2019t tell anyone that lived with me about the arrangements. I went out to the pool and my kitties were swimming in it. There was a baby pony near the pool. I swam with the kitties. There was a swing set on the hill above the pool. And there was an eerie feeling about it. My niece was playing on it. I called her over to swim with the kitties and to look at the pony. I don\\u2019t think she listened.\"],[\"There was an old vampire TV show called Angel when I was in high-school. I dreamed I was a character in the show. It took place in a city and at night. That's about all I can recall.\"],[\"There was another dream about something where I didn\\u2019t feel good and I left to go get a soft pretzel snack from a concession stand somewhere.\"],[\"There were many different parts to this dream - some of them in one of the houses I remodeled when I was younger and one in a larger home I don\\u2019t recognize. The section of this dream that stood out the most was towards the end when I was in a dorm room. I was so exhausted from everything I\\u2019d been doing and I just wanted to lay down and sleep until the graduation ceremony I was to go to. I laid down on what looked like a chaise lounge in a bedroom in a dorm room. There was another bed across from me. The entrance to the bathroom was in between the two beds. Although I was exhausted, I was aware, not awake, but aware, that a young man had come into the room and was also getting ready for the graduation. I\\u2019m also young - we\\u2019re both college aged. He\\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\\u2019ve ever seen, like from a different realm beautiful. That was the consensus all around, it wasn\\u2019t just my thoughts, the other women who were around thought the same. He\\u2019s being very considerate of the fact that I'm so tired and has not woken me at all, although I am still aware that he\\u2019s there, I\\u2019m still sleeping because I can feel the exhaustion dragging at my bones. There\\u2019s some sort of conversation he\\u2019s having with some other young women in the room about the plants, the flowers, that he has gathered for lies. He has a very magical quality about him - he seems very wise and ancient, like he knows a lot. So he\\u2019s explaining a little bit about why he\\u2019s picked plants for the leis for this graduation. He actually comes in and sits near me on my little bed, chaise-lounge, and is explaining one of the plants to some of the other women in the room, but I wake up at this point and as he\\u2019s explaining it, I\\u2019m looking at the plant. In the meantime, this beautiful young man creature is trying to get me to hurry because it\\u2019s time to get to this graduation. We haven\\u2019t been, but I\\u2019m just so mesmerized by all the different leis and necklaces in this box - there\\u2019s kukui nut leis and necklaces made of seed beds with over a hundred strands and they\\u2019re twisted together in pink and white and they\\u2019re heavy and gorgeous. But I know how much work has gone into making all these necklaces. There\\u2019s necklaces that have other polished crystal stones that look like pieces of peridot and darker stones, so maybe obsidian and onyx and those are single strands, but the stones are rather large. I start hanging them up in front of me. Suddenly these hooks appear and the hooks begin to fill with all of these necklaces and I\\u2019m running out of room for the hooks for the necklaces to hang. Also in the box is this huge ball of twine, but it reminds me of silk that you use to make necklaces with and it\\u2019s dyed a dark purple and there\\u2019s also beads that are not actually seeds from a plant about the size of those cilantro seeds. They\\u2019re dark brown and dried out with holes drilled through them. There\\u2019s a little package of them and it looks like 50 or so of them. I realize that I want to strand my own necklace with some of these seeds and make my own for part of the graduation although I have no time and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019d want to do that. I start to bead some of these seeds on the silk twine. I can hear myself say I can put them all on and the young man who is standing there gets a little upset with me and he says, \\u201cNo, those are too powerful. You only need 6.\\u201d I look at him and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s very adamant that I only need 6 on this necklace I\\u2019m making. So I stop. I have probably 10 or 12 on by now, but I stop making the necklace and I put it down. I realize I\\u2019m not going to have time to finish that necklace and I just need to pick one from all the ones I have and get to this graduation. Then the dream shifts and I don\\u2019t remember the rest.\"],[\"There were two parts to the dream - the first part I was with somebody but I don\\u2019t remember who, and it was dark and we were basically squatting at some building and we knew we weren\\u2019t supposed to be there (but we stayed there anyways) and there was some kind of election. We knew we had to leave because there was a new owner that came and we couldn\\u2019t stay. So we left and we went running through the woods and I lost the other person. I had to jump all these fences like one after another after another but they were set up really close to one another, so I would jump one and literally the next fence would be one foot after it. Then there are these artificial lights and I came across the stadium and the security guards were outside and I started jogging like it was my plan to jog there the whole time and look for this high school. I went inside and met this class that was gathered inside talking about their plans for graduation. Somebody said that they were accepted to medical school, somebody else was talking about something that they learned about themselves...like an introduction and it was artificial lighting like in the science lab and for some reason it was a high school. I told everybody, \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you at the University of Connecticut,\\u201d and I was telling them that I went there for high school. We played against them and always lost and I was coming there to find a job. I don\\u2019t think I was me in this dream.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a huge boat, like an oil tanker and cruise ship. I\\u2019m supposed to be on it. A lot of others are getting on, too. I\\u2019m sneaking onto it to get away from whatever situation I\\u2019m in. I\\u2019m on the boat and know I need to run back to wherever I live and pack a bag. I need to pack a really big duffel bag because I\\u2019m taking as much as I can with me and I\\u2019m not coming back. I\\u2019ve been on the boat. It\\u2019s dark and dirty. Some of my friends are on the boat, too. They\\u2019ve packed really big bags. I start to run home through a neighborhood. It\\u2019s dark. I see my friend drive by me in a red convertible. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cDo you need a ride?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes and I\\u2019m going to need a ride back to the boat. I don\\u2019t want to miss it. Can you wait for me?\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201ci can only wait a little bit because i\\u2019m grabbing something for someone.\\u201d I run into the house. I go to start packing my duffel bag. The only duffel bag I have is an old black and red one. It\\u2019s a bag I won in a golfing tournament that I worked when I was in high school. I still own this bag in real life. It\\u2019s big but not big enough because I\\u2019m not going to be able to fit all my clothes, winter clothes, makeup, toiletries and all of my witchy stuff like my tarot cards and whatnot. I\\u2019m going through all of my things and trying to be really discerning. I\\u2019m grabbing socks for different seasons and long johns for the cold. I\\u2019m trying to grab a puffy coat for winter but also balancing it out with summer clothes. I\\u2019m trying to be discerning as I pack because there won\\u2019t be enough room. I can feel that I\\u2019m getting frustrated. There\\u2019s a lot more to the dream. I don\\u2019t know if I even make it back onto the boat. I just know that it was important for me to get on the boat and there were a lot of others. Everyone is being sneaky because there\\u2019s something or someone trying to stop us. It feels like we\\u2019re escaping but I don\\u2019t know what.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a huge gathering of people all sitting at these long rectangular tables arranged end to end in a larger rectangle. I\\u2019m making pancakes. At first I make a nice batch of thin pancakes and distribute them as if I am feeding my own family, so I give two to each person and three to my husband. Then I look and realize there are so many more people to feed. I panic that they won\\u2019t be fed. I go back and cook another batch. I take a bite out of one, then soften the edge so it doesn\\u2019t look like it was bitten and I can give it away. I give one pancake to each person. Some people say no thank you. The people at the far end turn down the pancakes because they don\\u2019t trust these hippie kind of pancakes and others are watching their diets and don\\u2019t realize these are good for them. I make another batch and pass by my mother-in-law and my husband. She had been given two from the first batch and my husband was given three. I see that she has given her pancakes to my husband and he\\u2019s eating them, completely unaware that others are hungry. I hate it so much that they are totally unaware of other people\\u2019s needs. She could have given the extra pancakes away to the people who hadn\\u2019t had any food. He could have given his extra pancakes away instead of eating them all so quickly. I see that my brother-in-law is now trying to help in the kitchen. I\\u2019m annoyed by him, too, because he\\u2019s not being really helpful. I take another batch around. This batch is thicker. Some of the kids and their mom are helping to mix more batter. Their mom has poured the pancakes with a pan and used too much batter. I tell her to only use a spoon - she only needs a little bit for each pancake. Now there are really obese people. Some say no and some say yes to the pancakes. They feel the pancakes with goopy thick berry syrup. They\\u2019re so messy. When I go back to the kitchen area, it\\u2019s so messy. It\\u2019s not really a kitchen, just an area in the corner with a stovetop. The pancakes are all different sizes and textures. I don\\u2019t want to be involved in the project any longer. I leave. I\\u2019m walking around with a lot of different people, none of whom I recognize. It\\u2019s a hotel. I walk to the end of a hallway. I see Sophie and she bounces up to me, so happy to see me. She tells me all about her rituals and moon circles. I\\u2019m partially interested in what she\\u2019s sharing. Then I realize I\\u2019m responsible for the pancakes and need to get back. She walks with me through the hallways. We see a few people doing a yoga class together. We continue on. There\\u2019s a restorative yoga class happening and it\\u2019s extremely popular. I want to understand why so many people are attending because the teacher isn\\u2019t that great or special. I join near the front even though the class is in progress. I\\u2019m doing the postures and thinking it\\u2019s nice, but there\\u2019s nothing special about it. Suddenly this yappy dog comes running up and almost bites the teacher. A woman runs after the dog. She gets the dog and now somehow they\\u2019re all underwater. Another woman comes out from the crowd to help as if she knows them. She follows them out all the way up the stairs. I use this opportunity to leave and check on the pancakes. It\\u2019s nearly dark and I\\u2019m hoping everybody will have been fed their breakfast. But the pancakes are still cooking. There are pancakes of all sizes, some are stacked in baskets, some are stacked on plates and some are still cooking on the griddles. The heat is on but no one is watching. I\\u2019m worried that the pancakes will be burnt or too crispy. I take some of them off the griddle and keep some of them on to cook more. I step out and am told that the kids\\u2019 mother will be back with her husband later. They\\u2019re bringing their guns and will camp out and protect the pancakes overnight as they cook through the night. I guess it\\u2019s an okay idea, but I\\u2019m still uncomfortable with the pancakes cooking unattended. I switch off the heat on all the stovetops. I scoop the remaining pancakes out.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a lead up to this scene, but it\\u2019s escaping me. It was connected because it set me up for the emotions. What I do remember is being in a room. I\\u2019m in charge of making a meal for these children that are coming in. It\\u2019s a soccer clinic and all of these younger children are a part of it. It\\u2019s a mix of boys and girls and I think they\\u2019re all between the ages of 8 and 12. I\\u2019m supposed to be preparing the food, but also making sure there\\u2019s enough for everyone. There\\u2019s probably 50 kids coming through to eat. I\\u2019m working on it. The deadline is getting closer for the time I need to have the food prepared. It\\u2019s not totally prepared. There\\u2019s an interesting piece happening here where I have a basket of feathers - they could be chicken and raven feathers. I am taking the feathers and sewing them one at a time onto this food and it makes the food more abundant. So, I\\u2019m full on doing spells here - totally witchy. I\\u2019m realizing I\\u2019m running out of time, though. This man I know comes in. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll help you get this fixed up.\\u201d He comes in. His energy is very jarring to me. He grabs a bunch of feathers, and instead of helping make the food more abundant, he starts on this art project with the feathers. He\\u2019s talking the whole time - fucking windbag taking us so much air and space. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe need to listen to this music,\\u2019 and he puts this music on. It\\u2019s kind of jazzy and reminds me of the band Pink Martini from Portland. He is ruining the flow and I don\\u2019t like it. Now I\\u2019m really not getting things done. The thing is he\\u2019s so earnest and he thinks he\\u2019s helping. But of course, my self-reflection is, oh why do you have to be a bitch about it? But he\\u2019s not fucking helping. And he\\u2019s just taking up so much space and hijacking it. The kids start to come in now. The food is not ready. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay kids! We\\u2019ve got plenty here!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cWe barely have enough to feed the ten that just showed up and there\\u2019s going to be forty more coming.\\u201d So the first ten come in, get their food and they\\u2019re eating what they have. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is fucked. I don\\u2019t have the rest of everything I need.\\u201d The magic spell was like fishes and loaves - I was making more food out of the food we had - and now I don\\u2019t have any more of the food base material to make more food with. So more children come in. They\\u2019re sitting at tables with their plates. They had to go to their spot, grab their plate, walk to the buffet line, then fill up their plate. Now all these kids have their plates, but their plates are empty and they\\u2019re looking at me. All that\\u2019s left are mashed sweet potatoes or yams. They\\u2019re looking at me and the bacon is all gone - the meat/protein is gone. There\\u2019s not other vegetables. It\\u2019s just this bit of sweet potatoes and there\\u2019s not enough for the kids that come in. They\\u2019re staring at me and I have the worst sinking feeling in my stomach because I can\\u2019t feed the kids. It\\u2019s because my super efficient and effective ways of making food stretch and last just got hijacked by this dude. I wake up feeling completely fucking irritated.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a man and I think he is a father figure, sort of older. He\\u2019s swimming in the water down by the bottom. His t-shirt gets caught in the coral (which happened to me when I was a teenager, but I got away). I intuit before it happens that he\\u2019s going to get stuck. I\\u2019m standing there watching then dive down quickly to release him. I bring him back up. It\\u2019s pretty deep and it looks like we\\u2019re going up thirty feet. But when I was watching him, it felt like I was only about eight feet above. I watch his face the whole time as we\\u2019re going up. His eyes are open and there are bubbles of air going out of his mouth.\"],[\"There\\u2019s an awkward dream with a former friend, Liz. It\\u2019s like Edward and I have given her an itemized receipt or invoice for her to review and pay. She\\u2019s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There\\u2019s another dream where we\\u2019re looking at a house. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull. In another dream scene, I go into a bakery through the side door where baking scientists are discussing plans for the day. I\\u2019m not sure whether to leave or stay and ask my question. I don\\u2019t feel particularly welcome in this food laboratory.\"],[\"There\\u2019s Hawaiian boys, Chance and Shane, they are charming, good looking guys, younger. Annette and I were hiring them to help us move and we were paying them. I thought they were really sweet. After they moved everything, we realized they stole from us. I can\\u2019t remember what they stole, but they did. So we found them and got it back and accused them. They were so sorry. We felt bad for them. So we let them work for us again. This time they stole even more - thousands and thousands worth of stuff.\"],[\"There\\u2019s one part where I\\u2019m nursing a baby. I think it\\u2019s mine. My breasts are engorged as if I haven\\u2019t nursed in a while and the milk is coming out so fast, it\\u2019s almost choking the baby. Then I\\u2019m with my parents. I\\u2019m outside on a street. There\\u2019s a curb and a bunch of stand up paddle boards stacked. There\\u2019s a bunch of water coming down the street. It\\u2019s flooding again. These stand up paddle boards are stacked outside of a store and they\\u2019re starting to float off. These boards are a product that once you use them for their initial use, they turn into something else, then turn into something else again. I think it\\u2019s quite clever that the people who own this store have managed to figure out how to make items with multiple purposes. So the stand up board changes into a tank for a toilet, which is super efficient and only needs very little water and one flush, then also turns into an indoor house plant or a decoration. I am getting the sense that the products this store is putting out are amazing because each product is 3 different products within one. I\\u2019m standing in this street that\\u2019s flooded, trying to restack the boards, because I think it\\u2019s important for people to get on board with a shop and people who can figure out how to be so efficient and not waste materials and provide the basics of what we need because a stand up paddle board seems like a good idea when the streets are flooding. Then, the dream shifts. There\\u2019s a lawn. I\\u2019m standing on the side. There are a bunch of people mingling on the lawn - mostly white people. But there\\u2019s a Japanese family - mother, father, son. They\\u2019re a little bit away from the rest of the crowd and it looks and feels like it's a bit awkward and they aren\\u2019t being welcomed into the crowd. But they\\u2019re making do because they\\u2019re talking with each other Isee the father pick up a pinecone to toss at the son, for him to hit with a bat or catch, like baseball. The dad is in a suit. Everyone on this lawn is very well dressed. All of a sudden, the scene changes. I\\u2019m at a Japanese baseball game - in Japan, Japanese players, Japanese crowd. They\\u2019re so athletic. I\\u2019m watching the pitcher pitch and the batter sprint. I\\u2019m taking in their very athletic movements and noticing how in American culture we\\u2019re very snobbish and don\\u2019t think that others are as athletic as we are. But clearly these Japanese players have major skill and are even better than our American players. I\\u2019m also noticing how attractive each one of them are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow! I should be dating a Japanese baseball player!\\u201d Then the scene shifts. There\\u2019s a Japanese woman with jet black hair, down to her butt, straight, shiny, gorgeous. She\\u2019s in a skirt suit and I notice she\\u2019s wearing a wedding ring. She has a clipboard and cellphone. She\\u2019s clearly very busy, runs a lot of things, is very important. She\\u2019s walking down a sidewalk under trees. It looks like she\\u2019s walking outside the baseball stadium towards the owner\\u2019s booth. I watch as she sits down in there. The dreams shifts again to something else and I\\u2019m not actually in most of it; I\\u2019m just observing again.\"],[\"These are fragments: Gems underground. Chris Cuomo was having a party next door and it was just like you would imagine someone on tv is like in real life. I think I had been watching a lot of news or something. He was having a party and wearing a suit, maybe a plaid suit like old school. Young black man showing me where he died twice. Singing Hare Krishna. Woke up with maha mantra on my tongue.\"],[\"They were with anime characters. I believe i was in some type of relationship with them and we were following their original storyline. It\\u2019s just that I was an additional character on the side.\"],[\"This dream has a deeper part where I know I was deeper in the dream realms or sleep. There\\u2019s a castle - this huge black maybe glass castle perched on the edge of a shoreline. It\\u2019s super dramatic with tall cliffs and ocean waves hitting the edge of the cliffs. Everything is dark - the ocean and the sky. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s dark because it\\u2019s stormy and cloudy or because it\\u2019s night time. The inhabitants of the castle, myself included, are all pegasuses - horses with wings. They kind of remind me of the cartoon from my childhood, \\u201cMy Little Pony,\\u2019 but it\\u2019s not light and joyful like that cartoon. It\\u2019s definitely darker, not sinister, just dark. There\\u2019s a couple of us flying pegasus horses. We are friends and we all have our own magical powers. We have things to do and are coming and going. It\\u2019s clear that I have a journey to take. I need to go somewhere and fly through the sky. The first part of this journey is me looking for another pegasus sister. She has gone down into the ocean to find something. I realize I need to do the same thing. There\\u2019s a greenish blue orb of light that is way, way deep below the waves and that\\u2019s where I need to go. I\\u2019m flying over the ocean waves looking for this sister and for my way in. Finally I dive into the water. It\\u2019s not cold and I can breathe under the water. It seems pretty normal. I\\u2019m swimming/flying through the water going really deep to find this blueish green light. I do eventually get to it. It takes a long, long time. I know there is something waiting for me and I don\\u2019t remember what it is when I wake up. Whatever the information is, I receive it and I come back up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m not supposed to go back to the castle. I know I am to continue this journey. So now I\\u2019m flying over the ocean. The dark has gone. It\\u2019s like when a storm starts to clear and patches of light come through. I\\u2019m heading to blue sky, sunshine and bright daylight. Clouds are breaking up. I\\u2019m flying out of the darkness and towards the sunny, lighter part. The water beneath me is changing from black, dark, inky and choppy waves and storm tossed waters to deep-dark blue of a darker ocean to greenish blueish turquoise and I think the water is getting shallower. Then I get to a point where there is more land. I\\u2019ve left the land with that castle, which was all dark and craggy with cliffs. The land back there was like black lava rock. As I approach this land and the water gets shallower, I can see shoals and places with coral reef that I can see, then little atolls - places with a little bit of land above the water. Then there is even more land above the water with palm trees. It\\u2019s more substantial and I can see that off in the distance there are homes - a neighborhood, actually. What strikes me is as I\\u2019m flying over this place, I see a wooden bridge. I land on the bridge and as soon as I land, I turn from pegasus to human. Then I notice the water around me is light green and really shallow. You can see algae growing on rocks and the water is really warm. It\\u2019s the brackish water of a hot spring. I can tell because of the smell that the water is from a hot spring coming up into the ocean. So there is a completely different kind of plant and animal life happening here. I get in the water. All of it is so heartbreakingly beautiful - the colors, the shape of the land and reef underneath, the rocks in the water that I\\u2019m walking in, the color of the water, the color of the plants, the flowers, the birds. There are hummingbirds flying in and out, getting the nectar from the flowers. There is so much life. Part of me is still that pegasus, but part of me is human now, because I turn into human as I walk over this bridge. There is a car parked on this wooden bridge. My first thought is, \\u201cHow did that car even get on there? The bridge does not seem wide enough for a car, only a human. And how is this wooden bridge holding up a car?\\u201d Then I see a woman sitting in the car. She\\u2019s taking in the view the way I am. I can tell she has parked her car there because it is healing for her to be in this gorgeous brackish hot spring ocean verdant full of life area. There\\u2019s just enough room for me to walk past the backend of her car and finish crossing this bridge. Her car is in the middle of the bridge. As I walk past the car and onto this second section of the bridge that takes me to land where these houses and this neighborhood are, I feel a shift happen. I leave that very mystical and magical place I had been in with the castle and the journey over the ocean and being a flying horse, and now I\\u2019m in human world. But I\\u2019m very aware that I\\u2019m actually a pegasus. It reminds me of the movie, \\u201cThe Last Unicorn,\\u201d where they turn the unicorn into a human girl and she has to wander the forest until she finds the rest of her unicorn sisters who were turned into white water ocean foam. I feel that way. I\\u2019m not human but I\\u2019m in human land. There\\u2019s another bridge. The bridges change. The first one was a wooden platform bridge and this next bridge is a swinging wooden bridge that dips down and swings when you walk on it. The reason for these bridges is that they are going over the water. There are little islands of land and I haven\\u2019t made it to solid land yet. Even then, there are ravines through the solid land. The land is not yet solid or flat. I can see past that it is flat at a certain point. I have to go over these bridges to get to that solid point. The problem is I come to a third bridge and I can see at the other end a sign that says No Trespassing. It\\u2019s not facing me - it\\u2019s facing the other way. My side of the bridge is open and in fact, everything has been open. But as I get to the end of the other bridge, it\\u2019s sort of like a dead end. There\\u2019s a house. Interestingly enough, there is a bridge parallel to this one that has chains on it that go across. The chains are very clearly there to keep people from crossing or passing. There are signs on that bridge saying you\\u2019re trespassing if you're on here. The bridge I\\u2019m on only has the trespassing sign at the end of it. I go to cross it and it stops at this house. Their backyard is really low, below me. Their house is up a bit on a hill. I can see into their garage area. There are people - two women and a couple of children - and they see me coming. They\\u2019re not poor, but it\\u2019s like the simple houses in Hawaii. They look at me like I\\u2019m not supposed to be there. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI know, but I\\u2019ve come from the other direction. There were no signs where I came from indicating that I couldn\\u2019t come this way.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome down off that bridge and come into our yard.\\u201d Somehow I figure out how to come off the bridge. The thing is I need to continue on because I know there is a house I need to get to that is much further down this path. At the end of this bridge is a road I was supposed to walk on and follow down. This road is on a place called Puako on the Big Island. This neighborhood looks exactly like Puako. In waking life, I lived there for a year with an ex-boyfriend and it was a beautiful place to live. There are palm trees, kiawe trees and sand. The ocean is to my left and land is to my right. I\\u2019m trying to get on this road and my ex-boyfriend is down at the end of the road at a house. There\\u2019s a house with a lot of people and a party going on. I\\u2019m trying to get there, but a part of me doesn\\u2019t actually want to go there. I\\u2019m wondering: \\u201cWhy do you want to go there? There\\u2019s nothing in that for you.\\u201d Because there is this stopping point - this gate - for me at the end of this bridge, I can\\u2019t go any further. The women in this house want me to get off the bridge and come down and be with them. I do. Everything changes in that moment to very mundane world. They tell me there\\u2019s a concert happening. I\\u2019m curious about the concert. It\\u2019s a typical party with smoking and drinking, like the college kind of party. But it\\u2019s the neighborhood with all ages. Somebody is going to come play music. There are three younger men who come near me. They try to engage with me and talk with me. I notice at this point that it\\u2019s cold. I have knit handwarmers and a knit hat on. The pair of handwarmers is a pair I actually own - they\\u2019re elastic and grey and I knit them for myself. There\\u2019s another pair of handwarmers in my pocket that I have as extra in case anyone needs. One of these young men is talking with me about how he\\u2019s cold. I say, \\u201cWell, why don\\u2019t you just put on a pair of handwarmers? I have an extra pair.\\u201d I look down and see that he has a knit pair on, too. In my mind, I think, \\u201cOh, he has a pair of handwarmers that I\\u2019ve wanted to knit. I just haven\\u2019t gotten to it yet.\\u201d He takes one off. So now he\\u2019s wearing one and he has another in his hand and he says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve lost one.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s in your hand!\\u201d This whole time he and his other hand are giving me this weird vibe. I really don\\u2019t want to be around them and I don\\u2019t want to be at this party. I\\u2019m looking for a wide open space where I can transform back into the pegasus and fly away. So I find this place in the yard, but it\\u2019s covered in lentils. It\\u2019s a mountain of lentils. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I can\\u2019t transform in this. I can\\u2019t even walk in this. It\\u2019s just a mess.\\u201d The ground is not solid. I can\\u2019t anchor in so I can transform. In the meantime, these three younger men have followed me. I\\u2019m trying so hard to get away from them. I don\\u2019t want anything to do with them, the party, the vibe of the neighborhood. I\\u2019ve gone too far into this reality. I can tell. I want back into the other one. Even if I could just get back across the bridge, back into that incredibly beautiful land and the bridge that was beautiful in its own way and there weren\\u2019t all these humans yet and it wasn\\u2019t packed in. I just want to get back there or fly back all the way back to the castle. But I can\\u2019t. I am so stuck and I cannot transform. I start to feel panic and anxiety because if that is my grounded space, I don\\u2019t want to be grounded there. I want the other more beautiful space. I wake up with panic, anxiety and grief because I can\\u2019t get back to that beautiful place and I can\\u2019t transform back into my pegasus self and I feel so stuck.\"],[\"This dream is remembered mostly backwards. The last scene of the dream I look down at my phone and it\\u2019s lit up with Jeremy\\u2019s name. He\\u2019s calling. I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it\\u2019s him even though he\\u2019s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I\\u2019m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it\\u2019s not a video call, I can see him. He\\u2019s sitting on an oversized chair. He\\u2019s very awkward. He says, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s Jeremy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI know. Hi, how are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to be light. Then he says, \\u201cI owe you an explanation.\\u201d So then he starts to share. I can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I\\u2019m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It\\u2019s urgent. I\\u2019m running through snow. It\\u2019s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We\\u2019re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It\\u2019s a big pool and I\\u2019m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn\\u2019t notice that the water has been draining until it\\u2019s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I\\u2019m at dinner. It\\u2019s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.\"],[\"This dream really did not want to stick. I kept trying to call it back and it wouldn\\u2019t come even though I could feel the felt sense of it. There was something good going to happen if I could just get the right thing to happen - if I could just be lucid enough in the dream and follow the thread of what felt good, then something good would happen. I was in a large dance hall and the windows were floor to ceiling with curtains on either side. There\\u2019s bleachers. I\\u2019m sitting on the bleachers and take my shoes off. The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they\\u2019re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don\\u2019t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren\\u2019t there. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you\\u2019d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - \\u201chey go look over there, there\\u2019s all these shoes.\\u201d There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn\\u2019t progress through the dream if I didn\\u2019t find them. And I didn\\u2019t.\"],[\"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I\\u2019m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There\\u2019s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I\\u2019m packing bags. There\\u2019s a reason, although I don\\u2019t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I\\u2019m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing that?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, I have to do this anyway.\\u201d Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: \\u201cHow old is that child?\\u201d I look down in puzzlement and see that she\\u2019s only five. I think, \\u201cHow did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.\\u201d I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It\\u2019s not safe.\\u201d So, I tell him I\\u2019ve changed my mind. Then I\\u2019m uncertain what to do. Now I\\u2019m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we\\u2019re about to go to. I tell her that it\\u2019s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She\\u2019s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I\\u2019m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It\\u2019s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there\\u2019s one washroom to the left - it\\u2019s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There\\u2019s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we\\u2019re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I\\u2019m able to hear the one person I know - he\\u2019s an author - that he\\u2019s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he\\u2019s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we\\u2019re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I\\u2019m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I\\u2019m getting the feeling that there\\u2019s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don\\u2019t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there\\u2019s two of them - they\\u2019re also talking in hushed tones. I\\u2019m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I\\u2019ve come to this house for and it\\u2019s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn\\u2019t just an idea for a book, it\\u2019s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, \\u201cDo you recognize that?\\u201d I said yes. He says, \\u201cAfter this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.\\u201d So I agree. Then someone comes in that\\u2019s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he\\u2019s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he\\u2019s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s planning this way to get out that\\u2019s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that\\u2019s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I\\u2019m not really listening. I\\u2019m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who\\u2019s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that\\u2019s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat are they up to?\\u201d So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It\\u2019s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there\\u2019s urine all over the seat and it\\u2019s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s urine all over it. There\\u2019s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she\\u2019s still five and as I\\u2019m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I\\u2019ve been talking to and he\\u2019s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he\\u2019s drying it with another towel. He\\u2019s just had a shower. So he\\u2019s involved in what he\\u2019s doing. There\\u2019s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I\\u2019ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I\\u2019ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"This dream was about Trump (I\\u2019ve never dreamt of Trump before). In the dream, I\\u2019m in a top apartment or maybe a nice hotel or maybe a really nice attic apartment. I\\u2019m at the top of something. I\\u2019m sealing everything up. I\\u2019m closing the doors, I\\u2019m taping the windows, I\\u2019m taping the cracks. I\\u2019m sealing everything up because something really bad is about to happen and it\\u2019s connected to Trump. I\\u2019m assuming it\\u2019s toxic or poisonous or something. So I\\u2019m sealing everything up to stay safe for whatever is about to happen.\"],[\"this dream was all about Rory and a party he was throwing for work at our old house (which looked a lot like my grandparent\\u2019s old lake cottage). He wanted me to get everything ready but didn\\u2019t give me any idea as to the timing or numbers or theme. He was \\u201cbusy\\u201d with work and so charming to everyone but wouldn\\u2019t tell me anything. This is very much like real life. I woke up feeling so pissed off at him with my heart beating fast. My older sister was there too (in real life she lives in another state across the country, but in the dream she was here). I didn\\u2019t learn until the end that some people were going to stay the night after the party and I was supposed to get the rooms ready.\"],[\"This dream was probably based on the movie I saw tonight before I went to bed: something about the vast of night. The dream was about carrying a family\\u2019s history in the car on the highway. My dream looks different than the movie but the idea was similar which was I was carrying the stories in a car and I went to go drop them off somewhere for someone\\u2019s family history.\"],[\"This dream was really illusive, too. I\\u2019m in the dreams, then I shift into waking consciousness and the dreams are disappearing. I remember a section of this. There\\u2019s a bike race going on. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m a part of it or if my partner is a part of it. I have a partner, but not somebody I recognize. We have a dog together and we\\u2019re outside somewhere that\\u2019s part of the race. There's bikers going by. But there\\u2019s also this very strange element - they\\u2019re calling them land sharks. But they look nothing like sharks. They look like oversized pigs, actually. The snouts are really elongated and look like the front of a shark. They have four legs. Their bodies are pretty wide and tall. So I\\u2019m watching these bikers bike their race and these land sharks keep showing up and are the same size as the bikers. I have our dog and I\\u2019m going to take our dog out and run on the beach. My partner, this man, is pissed. He is so mad. He is like, \\u201cWhy are you taking the dog out? It\\u2019s going to be eaten by the land sharks.\\u201d Then something strange happens where I am simultaneously watching all of this happen and also the person taking the dog out. Suddenly, it\\u2019s not me with the dog, it\\u2019s my high school friend, Connie. She\\u2019s the one with the dog and her partner is scolding and berating her. It\\u2019s a very gross dynamic. She brings the dog back and puts the dog in the back of the car. She lays down and she\\u2019s clearly depressed and upset about it. I\\u2019m definitely the observer in this piece, where I went from being the one in that role to observing and feeling appalled at the way her partner is treating her.\"],[\"This dream was set at the ski resort and Aaron, one of my late husband\\u2019s friends, came by to ask me what to make his wife for her birthday. When he came over I was choosing from three tie dyed outfits to wear, one off the shoulder green tie dye and one of the others was like a fake drawn on tie dye. I offered him to get the tie dye shirt for her and he declined. I suggested he make her a yellow pillow and he thought about it but thought it was \\u201ctoo much work.\\u201d I tried to explain how easy it was and meaningful. Lastly, I helped him brainstorm getting Grateful Dead concert tickets. In real life he and my late husband played music together with a shared studio rental space. I like Grateful Dead and go to Dead and Co. shows now but this was not something they would have done or I would suggest in real life (he favors ska/punk).\"],[\"This dream was surreal. I dreamt that I was with my high school friends at a basketball tournament but got stuck/lost somewhere. A young Ram Dass came to be with me while I was stuck in some kind of trap. It was intimate physically but not sexual. In some way he represented all teachers, all people. He was just loving me, literally it felt like I was being filled with love. I felt warm and peaceful, content. I have never dreamt of him or any other of my teachers before. I woke up immediately feeling warm and loved.\"],[\"This dream wasn\\u2019t in black-and-white; it was like in dark blue and gray and white colors. It felt like it took place somewhere else entirely- no place I have ever been to in real life. The people I went to see in the dream were familiar to me in the dream but not in real life. I went to see a couple and I think in the dream I had known the male previously but it was years and years since I had seen him. When I got to their house we practiced yoga and I remember doing lots of hip openers and it was like I almost couldn\\u2019t get the deepest stretch because in everything I did, I was so flexible (this has not been the case in real life as I\\u2019ve not been able to practice like I used to). But the release that I felt from forward folds of all types was amazing - it was like I just folded into myself. I think I did a bunch of seated spinal twists, too. These are all things I can do in real life but for some reason in the dream I was like Gumby and I couldn\\u2019t find the tension to release half of the time. Then we all went to bed on the same bed, but it was not sexual. We just fell asleep and when we woke up we had to go somewhere so we scurried around getting ready and we were leaving. I needed to go back and do something like take my medicine or something like that. I messed up the covers and then I woke up.\"],[\"This is the deeper part of the dream that I\\u2019m only remembering flashes of. I\\u2019m with my high school classmates, three girls, Janet, Shawna and Julie. There are other classmates with me, but I\\u2019m not sure which ones. They\\u2019re all getting ready for a party and I\\u2019m trying to get ready with them. The house we\\u2019re in is dark. There was a felt sense of unease. My brother shows up, too. We are fighting and arguing. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re fighting about, but there\\u2019s definitely discord. All I can remember of this part of the dream is that I\\u2019m trying to get ready. They\\u2019re all ready to go and are leaving. I\\u2019m trying to find shoes to put on. I\\u2019m trying to find an entire outfit - I don\\u2019t know what to wear and don\\u2019t have anything that feels good. Part of it is my resistance to going to this party. It\\u2019s making it hard for me to decide on an outfit and shoes. A coworker of mine is here, too - he\\u2019s my date to this party. Of all the other characters, he\\u2019s the only one I feel comfortable with. He\\u2019s encouraging me in a sweet way to get dressed and get in the car with him. I do. There\\u2019s a party of the dream where I\\u2019m in the car with him and we are going somewhere. That feels nice and my body feels calm in that place. But there\\u2019s so much agitation beforehand when I\\u2019m trying to get dressed, and there is bickering between me and my friends and me and my brother. My coworker is trying to smooth everything out, help me get ready and take me to the party. I go from being in the house in the living room area with friends to being in his Jeep or truck. I have feelings of gratitude and safety while I'm in the car with him. Then the scene changes. I am outdoors near the ocean. There\\u2019s a covered pavilion area and a bunch of people dancing hula. It\\u2019s so lovely to watch them dancing. It\\u2019s a bunch of different haul halaus dancing, so they each have their own style and their own songs. It\\u2019s not super formal because there isn\\u2019t a stage. I\\u2019m standing watching them to my right and behind me. They have their leis and everything. The musicians are somewhere and I can hear them playing the music, but I can\\u2019t see them. Then my hula sister Deborah shows up with her dad and her mom and my hula brother, Uncle Kam who is also my alaka\\u2019i (leader) in the hula halau. We all look at each other and wonder why we aren\\u2019t dancing because we know how to dance and we have dances to share. So, we try to put on our music. Deborah\\u2019s dad starts to play - he\\u2019s our musician - but it\\u2019s so quiet that it\\u2019s hard to hear him over the crowd noise of all the other dancers. There\\u2019s this feeling of being misfits and not allowed or accepted. We are all trying to dance, but since we can\\u2019t hear the music, our movements are all a little bit off. The other dancers are looking at us like, \\u201cWhat are you guys doing? You\\u2019re not good.\\u201d But we are just unable to hear the music fully. That part of the dream fades away. The last thing I remember before waking is a voice saying it\\u2019s time for me to be soft and release all the tension in my body. Let go of the way things were and the way you knew how to do them. Be soft.\"],[\"This is the last part of the dream: I\\u2019m with a group of people in a tropical place. There\\u2019s red dirt like Hawaii, or maybe Costa Rica. My husband along with a couple (our friends and both yoga teachers), and a few others. We\\u2019ve been looking at houses. We come to this piece of land. Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We\\u2019re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they\\u2019re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They\\u2019re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we\\u2019re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings. I see people making the paper boats with bits of paper they found in the trash. There\\u2019s also some kind of healing going on.\"],[\"This is very bad\"],[\"This one was more emotional. I woke up with mixed emotions. In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn\\u2019t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that\\u2019s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows\"],[\"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people, but don\\u2019t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We\\u2019re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re heading, except that we\\u2019re trying to get out of where we are. It\\u2019s dark. If there is any lightning, it\\u2019s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we\\u2019re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don\\u2019t even know what they all do. We\\u2019re on the move. We\\u2019re all kind of dirty and grungy. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There\\u2019s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I\\u2019ve been practicing pole moves that she\\u2019s given me at home, but something happens and I\\u2019m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I\\u2019m watching. She\\u2019s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can\\u2019t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you\\u2019re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I\\u2019m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They\\u2019re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven\\u2019t touched a pole in weeks and don\\u2019t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it\\u2019s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It\\u2019s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I\\u2019m holding onto the handle to push out. I\\u2019m super disappointed because it\\u2019s so hard for me to do these moves because I\\u2019ve taken so much time off. I don\\u2019t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven\\u2019t been able to do what I\\u2019d like to do. I keep thinking I\\u2019m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I\\u2019ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back. That always bugs me.\"],[\"This was a nightmare of unspeakable betrayal by those I loved and whom I thought loved me.\"],[\"This was an anxiety dream about my daughter and the dentist. It was supposed to be my daughter, but it didn\\u2019t even look like her. It was a smaller child, maybe a toddler. The child had Down Syndrome. We were showing up at the dentist and we had to give her these pills. We gave her the first set of pills and we were sitting there waiting for them to take hold. The dentist was busy in the other room. When I went in there, they were having a breakfast meeting. We were sitting there and my daughter was on drugs for this appointment. They wanted us to give her two pills every 10-15 minutes. So they were having us give her more and more, but they weren\\u2019t even doing anything with her. I was getting really annoyed. At a certain point, I looked at this child who doesn\\u2019t even look like my daughter and they were grinding their jaw like someone on ecstasy. The child was doing this. I was getting really frustrated. The child looked like they had too many drugs in their system, but they kept asking us to give them more. Then I went in to talk to the dentist: \\u201cWhy are you not doing the procedure? She\\u2019s ready to go.\\u201d They were having breakfast and I was really annoyed and the appointment was dragging on longer. There was also a guy in there and he was an astrologer. He had slides up about the Venus cycle. They were actually really cool and I said, \\u201cWow that\\u2019s really interesting, I want to get your book.\\u201d Then I realize that Uranus is square my Venus tonight and I was like, \\u201cHuh, I wonder if it\\u2019s all about meeting this guy and that was some random side note.\\u201d Before we got to the dentist, there were other things going on and images. One was a family washing their clothes in a puddle of water on the side of the street in New York City. it was clean water - it was not gross looking. But I was like, \\u201cOh my god, this poor family.\\u201d\"],[\"This was an interesting dream. I could feel my body but also my thought processes and emotions detoxing through the dream. At one point I lucidly realized I was detoxing from my heart. I could feel energy coming off the heart. I am wandering around outside in a town I don\\u2019t recognize. It\\u2019s dark. There\\u2019s a parade or some kind of street celebration happening. I\\u2019m wandering by myself following an intuitive tug to wander. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going or why I\\u2019m out. I just know that the thing I need to do or see will show up. Sure enough, I\\u2019m walking through an outdoor mall area towards one of the streets. I see my old hula teacher. I know this is why I was walking - I need to talk to her. I also see her twin sister. Her twin sister has a bunch of girls who are going to dance. My hula teacher also has her girls that will be dancing. The twin sister\\u2019s girls are wearing green skirts with white tops. My hula teacher\\u2019s girls are wearing red skirts with white tops. My hula teacher sees her niece with her twin sister\\u2019s halau. She starts yelling at her niece: \\u201cI saw you come take your costumes. Why are you dancing with her?\\u201d She\\u2019s not being nice at all. I\\u2019m observing this from the side. She\\u2019s shaming her hardcore, which is waht she used to do to me. I walk up to her and say hello. She doesn\\u2019t want to talk with me - she\\u2019s just giving me side-eye and stink-eye. She does not want to engage. I walk with her for a little bit. Her students walk ahead of us. The twin sister and those students also walk ahead, so it just ends up being me and her. I look at her and tell her that I was so upset and I\\u2019ve been upset and mad at her with the way she talks to others and treats people. I tell her I understand she thinks she\\u2019s doing it from a place of love, but it\\u2019s really hurtful to others in the way she shames them. She\\u2019s rolling her eyes at me while I\\u2019m saying this. I grab her shoulders and give her a hug and say, \\u201cI forgive you. And don\\u2019t do that anymore. Stop doing that to the people you love. Don\\u2019t do that to me or to the other people in your life.\\u201d - kind of ho\\u2019oponopono style. I think this is where I was doing the detoxing because I can feel a weight come off my shoulders because I finally said what I needed to say to her. She doesn\\u2019t soften towards me, but I get to say what I need to say. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m with people I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m traveling somewhere. This man who I recognize from infomercials on tv. He is a white dude with greyish-white hair that\\u2019s long to his shoulders, skinny guy. He asks me and some others to come with him. He\\u2019s recruiting us. He wants to show us this product and this lifestyle he\\u2019s created. He takes us to his complex - he lives there, but there are also places for others to live. There\\u2019s a cafeteria where they all go and eat meals. He has a couple assistants that help him. One of his assistants is his brother or something. I\\u2019m getting guru and cult vibes. There is a lot of advanced technology. He is trying to sell me on a way to be really healthy. So he\\u2019s walking me and the other recruits through his program or process of how to do it. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDude, you\\u2019re missing some major components. What you call exercise isn\\u2019t exercise. The kind of food you serve is not a healthy way to track food and it won\\u2019t work because the food you\\u2019re eating isn\\u2019t healthy. And no pill has ever gotten anyone healthy ever.\\u201d I\\u2019m mostly silent. We\\u2019re all following him around this complex. At one point he asks me to take off my shoes. So I take off my shoes and they end up in this trash chute. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cShit, I don\\u2019t have shoes.\\u201d I\\u2019m going around without them and following him. I feel gross. I don\\u2019t want to be here with this dude. It feels weird. It feels controlling. It feels manipulative. At one point, we\\u2019re in the cafeteria and he\\u2019s sending us and the recruits home because he was disappointed in us and we didn\\u2019t do good enough. That\\u2019s because all of us were questioning him and his weird take on things. We\\u2019re in the cafeteria and he says, \\u201cTake some salso home with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m filling a container with salsa and it\\u2019s overflowing. One of his assistants comes to help and she says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s a lid.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want the salsa because it doesn\\u2019t seem healthy and what am I going to do with a huge bucket full of salsa, anyway. I\\u2019m still barefoot and concerned because I can\\u2019t find my shoes. They\\u2019re taking us off the complex and putting us in a vehicle to escort us off. I\\u2019m frustrated because I don\\u2019t have my slippers. Then the scene changes again. It\\u2019s somewhere in Asia - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s Japan or China or somewhere else. There\\u2019s a wedding happening. They\\u2019re trying to teach me how to do the wedding ceremony. It\\u2019s complicated and involves dragons and a sleigh that flies in the air. I watch it the first time and am like, \\u201cOkay, I think you\\u2019re missing some parts to this thing because the sleigh isn\\u2019t flying right.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s my turn. A show is going on and they\\u2019ve saved this part for me to do. I manage to get the first part of the ceremony down, marrying this cute couple who are Asian - everyone is Asian and I\\u2019m the only one who is not. There are two dragons hooked to the front of the sleigh. I manage to get the sleigh up off the ground. It\\u2019s going through the air and the couple is in it. I\\u2019m in the back behind decorating it and watching the dragons. The dragons have their mouths on a bar under the sleigh and their momentum is propelling the sleigh forward. All of a sudden I hear someone say, \\u201cYou forgot a piece of it.\\u201d In the ceremony the sleigh is supposed to be able to move forward but then dip and go different directions, but as I\\u2019m doing it, the sleigh comes to a dead stop midair and even though the dragons\\u2019 mouths are hanging onto the bar, their bodies flop down and the sleigh has no momentum. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god, the sleigh is going to start falling. The couple in it are going to die. I\\u2019m going to die, too, because I\\u2019m somehow connected to all of it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what the missing piece is to keep the sleigh going, to keep the ceremony going, to keep the whole thing moving. I\\u2019m freaking out because either I didn\\u2019t learn it or I wasn\\u2019t taught it or shown it. I know I\\u2019m missing a piece and these dragons are hanging. Then the sleigh starts to drop. The dream shifts. It\\u2019s dark now. I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood - through the backyards of brick row houses. I\\u2019m on the phone with someone who is my counselor. The person I\\u2019m talking to is a woman. As she and I are talking, we are interrupted by a man. He\\u2019s talking over the woman. He starts to say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who\\u2019s going to take care of you. Don\\u2019t call her. I\\u2019m the one who\\u2019s talking to you. I\\u2019m taking care of you.\\u201d It\\u2019s very creepy because he\\u2019s very possessive and he\\u2019s speaking in terms of ownership. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cEw, ick, you\\u2019re supposed to be a therapist.\\u201d The woman hangs up while this other man is still on the call. I keep walking through these backyards. All of a sudden I walk through a backyard and there\\u2019s a table set up. There\\u2019s a big old banyan tree behind the table. I walk up to it. The dude on the phone with me is sitting there. We both hang up and I\\u2019m looking at him and am a little bit freaked out. He\\u2019s in my space now and here face to face and trying to counsel me around something. He\\u2019s creeping me out. He has dark hair that\\u2019s curly and it\\u2019s longish, it looks like a little fro. He tells me to sit down in the chair on the other side of the desk from him. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking care of you now. I\\u2019m your therapist. I\\u2019m the one you\\u2019re supposed to talk to.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to talk to you. You\\u2019re creeping me out.\\u201d Then he starts to say things like, \\u201cAnd yes, I\\u2019m totally flirting with you because I think you\\u2019re sexy and I\\u2019m going to make you mine.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m really fucking freaked out. That\\u2019s where the dream ends.\"],[\"This was kind of a weird dream. I\\u2019m looking for a house to buy. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m with my ex and the kids or some other family. I just know I\\u2019m with other people and we\\u2019re all looking at houses together. There\\u2019s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you\\u2019d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They\\u2019re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu\\u2019u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I\\u2019m looking and we decide not to buy it because it\\u2019s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I\\u2019m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They\\u2019ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren\\u2019t white anymore. They\\u2019ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m not comfortable with them. I\\u2019m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I\\u2019m not sure who it is; it\\u2019s a female person and we\\u2019re not really friends. It\\u2019s kind of like I\\u2019m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it\\u2019s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We\\u2019re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I\\u2019m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn\\u2019t feel a connection either, so she\\u2019s just gone. As I leave, I\\u2019m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I\\u2019m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn\\u2019t really resonance there anyway. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it\\u2019s just not for me.\"],[\"This was so fragmented - I had a dream that I was watching myself on a phone call on a corner having a serious conversation about something and then watching a neighbor come across me who was across the street from me.

The deeper dream I think is a man and me - I think it\\u2019s my ex-husband. We\\u2019re in a house. This person is Santa Claus. He\\u2019s responsible for bringing joy to children, but it looks like my ex and not Santa Claus. We\\u2019re in a house and all around the house is white tundra, so North Pole\\u2019ish. It starts out as a gigantic mansion. I\\u2019m me, but I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m female. It\\u2019s like we\\u2019re two friends. This guy has a role - an important job. It almost feels like I\\u2019m freeloading because there isn\\u2019t anything I\\u2019m doing. He points it out, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t even have a job. You don\\u2019t even have a purpose, really.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOoh, that feels gross. I need to go find my purpose.\\u201d Then it shifts from this gigantic mansion place that is super opulent with gold, wall sconces, chandeliers, and gigantic floor to ceiling windows that are at least two stories tall. I think I\\u2019m standing on this huge staircase at some point. Then the mansion shrinks down to this smaller house. Now it is my ex and me. I don\\u2019t know that I\\u2019m female yet. I think I\\u2019m still his friend - I\\u2019m a dude. There are a bunch of kids that he\\u2019s supposed to be caretaking or bringing the light to. I think they\\u2019re maybe ours. The vibe between the two of us is weird. He\\u2019s definitely holding the power over me. But I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to be caretaking these kids and I\\u2019m actually doing all the work here. You\\u2019re not fulfilling your role.\\u201d So he says to me, \\u201cWell let\\u2019s talk and work this out.\\u201d So while we\\u2019re trying to talk, we\\u2019re also doing - we\\u2019re moving through different rooms in the house, cleaning or packing to go on a trip. We\\u2019re packing things in one room of the house. Then we\\u2019re moving to the kitchen and I\\u2019m packing up food and he is doing stuff. The kids are following us around the house observing what\\u2019s going on. Also we give them small chores to do as we move through rooms in the house. At some point I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhen are you going to stop and hug the children? When are you going to love on them? They\\u2019re wanting our attention, but you just keep giving them these chores to do and sending them off. But what they really want is a hug and some love.\\u201d I ask him that and he gives some sort of weird answer. The implication is that he\\u2019s not going to touch or comfort them. I\\u2019m left to do it. Then it\\u2019s time for the kids to get in the sleigh or the car. They start walking out the door and there\\u2019s quite a few kids - not just 2, but 10. He and I are alone for a second and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cCan we get real now and talk about what\\u2019s going on and this weirdness?\\u201d He says to me something that is pretty profound, but I can\\u2019t remember it. After he says this, I don\\u2019t feel like there\\u2019s been any resolution. I don't feel myself softening towards him. Then the dream totally shifts. I\\u2019m an observer. I\\u2019ve popped into this observer role. There\\u2019s an airport and a huge airplane being loaded - lots of people getting on. There are two guys left. I see a ramp or part of the landing gear. This guy is in shorts, tennis shoes and a long sleeve shirt tied around his waist. He\\u2019s up on the ramp and the plane takes off. You hear the pilot or flight attendants say, \\u201cOkay everyone, you need to get in the plane now. Get all the way in.\\u201d This guy is like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to ride the plane from here!\\u201d It\\u2019s him and another guy on it. The second guy is dressed in one of those flying squirrel suits and has goggles over his eyes. He\\u2019s got a plan - he\\u2019s going to do something as this plane takes off. And he does. As the plane gets to altitude, he jumps off, flies off and goes to wherever he\\u2019s going. The other guy who is in shorts and tennis shoes and a long-sleeved shirt tied around his waist, his goal is to ride out the entire plane ride on this ramp. Part of me wonders if they\\u2019re going to pull this ramp in because you can\\u2019t fly a plane with this ramp hanging off. But this guy\\u2019s goal is to ride on this ramp to wherever this plane is going. His goal is to break some record. I\\u2019m observing all of this, neither in the plane nor on the ramp. But I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s going to freeze to death because it\\u2019s going to be so cold at altitude, and he\\u2019s going to burn his skin to death because he doesn\\u2019t have sunscreen or a shirt on or anything on his face and he\\u2019s close to the sun. Hello?! And there\\u2019s no oxygen. How is he going to do this? This man is so unbothered by all of it. He\\u2019s not scared that he\\u2019s going to let go of the ramp and fly off. He\\u2019s not scared that he\\u2019s going to fall. He\\u2019s not worried that he\\u2019s too close to the sun. He's not worried that he\\u2019s too high up. He\\u2019s not worried that there\\u2019s not enough oxygen. He\\u2019s incredibly unbothered and so relaxed that he actually takes a nap at some point on this ramp as the plane is flying. In my head I know none of this is possible and he would have blown off the ramp a long time ago. But then the plane lands. He lands with the plane. Where the plane lands, there are a bunch of other planes and guys. There are men everywhere and not a single female to be found. It was clearly some kind of competition happening. They\\u2019re all patting each other on the back and congratulating each other. They\\u2019re in different pods. An M.C. comes out and you can hear over the loudspeakers someone say, \\u201cAnd the winner for being most exposed to the elements\\u2026\\u201d They announce the name of the winner, but it\\u2019s not my guy, even though he should have won. You see him be super crestfallen. But everyone else is cheering the winner. The other guy that was in the squirrel suit is there, too. He was also part of a competition - it was about getting to a certain place in the most difficult way. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDude, my guy on the ramp totally wins because he did not have any fancy gear. He was just in his keds and shorts on a ramp.\\u201d Somebody from the airplane finally speaks up and says, \\u201cActually, I think it was this guy who really won. He wasn\\u2019t really registered and no one took note of him, but he rode this plane the entire time and never fell off.\\u201d All of a sudden, the judges come together and confer. The M.C. gets on the microphone and says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s been a change. The winner is this guy!\\u201d It\\u2019s my guy who was on the ramp the whole time. You see his face light up and he\\u2019s exuberant in a quiet humble way. He\\u2019s not loud like the other guys. I get the sense that he was on a spiritual journey. Yes, he won the competition, but what he was really looking for was for God to acknowledge him, \\u201cYes, my son, you did this.\\u201d It ends with everyone cheering him and him with a really big smile on his face and really humble. I\\u2019m wondering how any of that was possible.\"],[\"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He\\u2019s very protective. I\\u2019m lying down on my back. I can\\u2019t tell where I am. There\\u2019s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I\\u2019m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I\\u2019m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I\\u2019m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it\\u2019s the time of coronavirus, people can\\u2019t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They\\u2019re gathered around me and I\\u2019m definitely still vulnerable because I\\u2019m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I\\u2019m telling them: \\u201cMy playlists are for pole classes. It\\u2019s not your normal CrossFit playlist.\\u201d They don\\u2019t care. They\\u2019re adamant that they get a workout. So, it\\u2019s either the man I\\u2019m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It\\u2019s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren\\u2019t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, \\u201cOkay, the winners get some of these ferrets.\\u201d During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s my kids or somebody else\\u2019s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I\\u2019m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they\\u2019re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn\\u2019t going to be what they thought. I\\u2019m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There\\u2019s this process I\\u2019m going through where I\\u2019m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they\\u2019re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can\\u2019t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they\\u2019re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I\\u2019m in the observer role. There\\u2019s a man and his son - I don\\u2019t know who they are. He\\u2019s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he\\u2019s very attentive. They\\u2019re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I\\u2019m not very neutral. I\\u2019m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it\\u2019s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he\\u2019s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, \\u201cWe need to take your son.\\u201d The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I\\u2019m fucking pissed. There\\u2019s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it\\u2019s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he\\u2019s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they\\u2019re basically not listening - they\\u2019re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man\\u2019s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that\\u2019s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.\"],[\"Two people are going into a room, to change something?....a man and a woman\\u2026.They do not want to do it, but I know it is important\\u2026.They are being watched, told to do this\\u2026.Earlier, I see water flowing in a creek\\u2026.a higher wave or flow to the left, like things are tipping that direction\\u2026.\"],[\"Two scenes where there was a neighborhood restaurant or group of restaurants and we needed goggles and masks to go in and some cost extra money.

There was an old school book on tape and it was the primer. We were all supposed to read it and there were different versions. There was one in a gift shop but Elon Musk bought all the good copies and I got one that was a basic generic version. A woman with long brown hair and I bonded because she got the same basic version - later we both remarked that we should have gotten the one with the global world view or universalist view, not just American! \\u201cHow small minded of us,\\u201d we laughed! There was this idea that there was a broader view larger than global, larger than maybe even universal, and we were acknowledging the barrier to learning. We made a plan to meet up later, and we were walking on the world like walking on the globe. We were space walking, but it was like on trees and we were going from planet to planet like it was nothing. We were wearing headphones and she pointed to them and \\u201cStanding on the Moon\\u201d was playing but scratchy like old old records sound from the 1920s. Usually that song makes me emotional but I remember feeling nostalgic. There was supposed to be a list a day of who to invite. There was a dad of Asian descent and two of his kids - a boy and a girl - and it was strange to see a boy. I made a comment when he was letting them explore just to let him know it was good to let them go and he thanked me for the reminder. As I am waking up for some reason the numbers 1618 kept coming up in my mind related to this image.\"],[\"Was leading my (real) black roommates through dark alleys to try to keep them from being seen by police patrolling everywhere who might shoot them.

Hell no!

There were maybe ten of us and it was all decorated for the holidays. We were celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah in the new year. Someone came that wasn\\u2019t supposed to come and started murdering all the Jewish people. It was really upsetting having people with guns. Then fast forward, I was at the same location and we were doing a world service. I sat in the front room with one of the attendings, Dr. Donovan. It was just three people in the front row -nher and me and somebody else on the left-hand side.

There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there\\u2019s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It\\u2019s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I\\u2019m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I\\u2019m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don\\u2019t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They\\u2019re all great and I love them all. I\\u2019m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don\\u2019t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I\\u2019m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I\\u2019m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he\\u2019s pointing out. It\\u2019s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I\\u2019m in a shop. It is Jeremy\\u2019s shop. It\\u2019s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It\\u2019s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race. So we set a trajectory...\"],[\"\\u201cAdventures\\u201d I take a taxi to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I arrive and he\\u2019s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I\\u2019m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I\\u2019m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He\\u2019s also wearing something similar. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t really look like pajamas, so it\\u2019s okay to go out in them.\\u201d So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He\\u2019s in the front seat, passenger side. I\\u2019m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I\\u2019ve ever been to the town stadium. I\\u2019m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, \\u201cDo you mean the Place or the Colosseum?\\u201d At the same time as he\\u2019s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He\\u2019s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I\\u2019m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we\\u2019re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It\\u2019s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it\\u2019s glassed in and there\\u2019s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it\\u2019s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there\\u2019s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I\\u2019ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He\\u2019s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I\\u2019m trying to think where I\\u2019ve seen him. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He\\u2019s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they\\u2019re hundreds of years old. They look like they\\u2019re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it\\u2019s old because the lawns aren\\u2019t maincured, but set because they\\u2019ve been cared for so long they don\\u2019t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it\\u2019s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800\\u2019s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you\\u2019re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It\\u2019s just a screen door and is not latched. I can\\u2019t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman\\u2019s voice say, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I answer back, \\u201cHello? Hello?\\u201d But she doesn\\u2019t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It\\u2019s a kitchen. It\\u2019s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it\\u2019s made just for cooking. There\\u2019s a doorway and we go into the next room. There\\u2019s a proper sized eating table in it. There\\u2019s another oven on the wall and I don\\u2019t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it\\u2019s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn\\u2019t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you\\u2019re on the waterfront. We\\u2019re about to go down the steps when I say, \\u201cJust a minute. Let\\u2019s walk back through here again. I noticed something.\\u201d So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, \\u201cLook, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There\\u2019s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn\\u2019t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.\\u201d Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We\\u2019re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I\\u2019m walking. He doesn\\u2019t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It\\u2019s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I\\u2019m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He\\u2019s a little more scared than I. I\\u2019m surprised that he\\u2019s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it\\u2019s like a pig fetus. It\\u2019s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He\\u2019s getting a little scared. It\\u2019s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I\\u2019m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can\\u2019t see it if you\\u2019re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There\\u2019s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there\\u2019s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They\\u2019re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there\\u2019s this other kind of thing that I see. It\\u2019s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to swim in that water.\\u201d Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She\\u2019s clothed and under the water. It looks like she\\u2019s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, \\u201cOh no! We have to save her!\\u201d So, I slip into the water and grab her. She\\u2019s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady\\u2019s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There\\u2019s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she\\u2019s only been hanging onto the pole and she\\u2019s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she\\u2019s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She\\u2019s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, \\u201cLook, she\\u2019s going to be okay.\\u201d Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I\\u2019m giving her small sips and supporting her head.\"],[\"\\u201cAngry Mob\\u201d All I remember is standing by feeling helpless while watching an angry mob. They were weaponized with sticks, clubs, baseball bats, things you could pound on with. They were filing up the street angrily shouting and it was a street that looked like a suburban street. They were smashing the cars that were parallel parked, smashing the hoods of the cars, breaking all the glass in the windows, getting on top of the cars and smashing the roofs and just going up the street doing this. In the dream, I watch this, feeling helpless to stop. I can\\u2019t permeate the crowd. I have nothing to protect myself with. Then the crowd is gone - they continued up the street and are out of sight now. I\\u2019m standing while other people come out of hiding. They are commenting on the damage. Somebody says, \\u201cI know who the first two cars belong to. The first one belongs to the president of yoga and the second one belongs to the vice president.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cBraids\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large crowd of people. Somebody that I\\u2019m working for has instructed me to make sure that no one\\u2019s hair is in their eyes. I\\u2019ve got this kit that has different things that can be braided into people\\u2019s hair and fastened so the braids don\\u2019t come out. There are quite a few different pieces and lots of different colors, so that no matter what color anyone\\u2019s hair is or what color their skin is, the braids will look attractive and match their own personal style. When I first start doing this I\\u2019m using a chart because some people have been sick. I\\u2019m in a white sterile type of environment. I kind of move through there braiding the hair of those I kind. It\\u2019s one long white room packed with people shoulder to shoulder. It\\u2019s kind of hard to maneuver around and do what I\\u2019m supposed to do. As I complete this task, the room leads into another room that is dark with no lights on. So instead of being really bright and whiite, it\\u2019s dark but also more colorful. There\\u2019s a stage and people are performing some kind of music up on the stage. It\\u2019s an open mic night, so it could be anybody. There isn't a full band, just one person at a time performing. While this is going on, I\\u2019m on the lower level around whoever is watching and doing their hair. Then I complete the braids of the people I\\u2019m supposed to. The next person is a guy that\\u2019s just finishing performing. He\\u2019s sitting off to the side of the stage. More people are coming from the audience and sitting on the side so you can hardly see where the stage is. It\\u2019s also dark. I\\u2019m wondering what I\\u2019m going to do with his hair because he has a scarf around his head, his hair is inside of it and he\\u2019s wearing a hat on top of that. I tell him what I\\u2019m here to do and he says, \\u201cOkay. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to do with it though.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell what would you like?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m pretty happy with it the way it is.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine. Do you want me to just put a couple of pieces around the temples?\\u201d He takes the hat off and removes the scarf. His hair is all in cornrows. One of them is binding all of them into one large ponytail. I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019ve been instructed to do his hair, it\\u2019s perfectly fine the way it is. So I just try and wrap the scarf around his head the way it was and fasten it a little more sturdily. While I\\u2019m doing this, I see my ex-best friend. She\\u2019s taking the stage and jumping up and down and waving her arms around, but that\\u2019s all she\\u2019s doing. She\\u2019s not singing anything, she doesn\\u2019t have any talent, she\\u2019s just jumping up and down trying to get people to look at her. Then I see her family coming up to watch her, but the parents have had two more children. I think, \\u201cWow, the mom is over fifty. The youngest is probably going to be orphaned soon. I wonder how fair that is to have kids at that age?\\u201d When her family arrives, she stops jumping up and down and pretends to be limping as though she\\u2019s sick. Everyone is rushing over to her and saying, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\\u201d I feel like oh there she goes again doing her antics. I don\\u2019t go over and speak to them. I pick up the things I was using for the hair. I say goodbye and thank you to the guy who had basically undid his perfectly good hair and let me touch it and do something with it that wasn\\u2019t even useful and then he put it back together himself. I walk back through the crowd. Now I look down. I\\u2019m sure I was completely dressed when I started this, but now I\\u2019m wearing a tanktop that\\u2019s one of those old man\\u2019s undershirts. My own underwear is white and baggy like an old man\\u2019s. I feel exposed and naked. I\\u2019m not comfortable with this. I don\\u2019t even want anyone to see me. I\\u2019m trying to shoulder my way back through the crowd and stay in the dark. I go into the washroom which is part of another big room - it\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s bedroom. It\\u2019s a really messy bedroom with clothes all over the place. I\\u2019m hoping I can find something to put on.\"],[\"\\u201cCar Pooling\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town that looks like modern suburbia. I\\u2019m driving a car. I come down a street and it\\u2019s like a keyhole where you have to turn around eventually. There\\u2019s some parallel parking up by the curb. I go around the keyhole and pull up so I\\u2019m facing the same way that I came in. I get out of the car. I walk down a little walkway that goes in between two houses. I walk past the houses and to another row of houses behind that have no street access. I go into the front door. It belongs to one of my yoga teacher training students. There are a couple of kids in there and other students from my teacher training. She gets her things together. We both walk out of her house to my car. We drive the car around to a different street that looks very much like the street we were just on. We drive to the end of the keyhole and get out. We go into a building that feels like a university. I don\\u2019t remember what we do. We come back out and get into the car and drive back to her house. I park in the same space that I did before. This time when we go into her house, there are a lot more people in it. There\\u2019s a tall man wearing glasses. I can\\u2019t see the color of his eyes. He has strawberry blond hair brushed straight back from his face, it\\u2019s shoulder length. He\\u2019s talking to me about something but I don\\u2019t remember what it was. There are a couple of students from my yoga teacher training who are still there and some small kids under the age of five. One of the kids is a one year old with a very bright alert face. He\\u2019s crawling then grabbing a piece of furniture to pull himself up to standing, taking a couple of steps, then plunking down and crawling again. He\\u2019s circulating around to all the people, using their knees to pull himself up. He\\u2019s making non-verbal but very animated sounds. He looks at me with this very piercing eyes that look like a much older adult. As he\\u2019s making these rounds, he gets to me. He has this charisma. I\\u2019m quite fascinated with his charisma. You know how kids when they want to be picked up but don\\u2019t have any speech, they just reach with their arms? He does this. I pick him up. He uses one arm to point. I know he\\u2019s using me as legs so he can\\u2019t get to the other side of the room. He has some kind of agenda. So I stand up and take him over. He\\u2019s pointing at the sink and wants the sink. I shift him down a bit so I\\u2019m hoisting him up with my hips. He\\u2019s leaning over the sink and his feet aren\\u2019t touching the ground. He wants to play with the water. I\\u2019m looking around and don\\u2019t know which of the people are his parents. Nobody looks like they own him. Nobody is alarmed that he\\u2019s at the sink. Nobody is making any kind of awareness at all, so I guess it\\u2019s fine. I turn the tap on and he\\u2019s playing with the water with his hands. It\\u2019s one of those great big farmhouse style sinks so it\\u2019s pretty deep. There\\u2019s a plastic container beside the sink. For some reason, the floor is under his feet and he\\u2019s really stable so quite safe to stay there. I leave him there for a second to get a towel. I turn around for about three seconds. In those three seconds, he gets the plastic container and it has oil or something in it. I look at it and think there was Vitamin D in it. He\\u2019s found an eyedropper and he\\u2019s made a pattern with the Vitamin D all over the sink and on the tap and stuff. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYup, leave it to a baby to create a giant mess in one second.\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering if I should wipe this up or maybe it\\u2019s good that it\\u2019s there because it\\u2019s Vitamin D. I take my own hand and am doing the same thing he\\u2019s doing - massaging the Vitamin D onto the sides of the sink, coating it. I know that it\\u2019s getting into us through our skin. Then I realize that the students that are talking are sharing dreams. I wonder how I missed that and I don\\u2019t want to miss it. I think I pick the baby up and put him on my lap, but then he disappears into the dream and I\\u2019m sitting where I was when I picked him up originally. I hear Cora talking about something in her dream. Her hair is short. I\\u2019m listening to Meg talking about her dream. She\\u2019s talking about a dream where Cora cuts her hair off. I feel like I want to interrupt because it\\u2019s the exact same dream I had last night where Cora cuts her hair. She had really, really long brown hair. Then of course we're both sitting looking at Cora with short hair. The whole group realizes that Meg and I had the same dream in advance of Cora cutting her hair. Then I\\u2019m not sure that Cora cut her hair because we had the dream. So I\\u2019m thinking about this and not saying anything, just mulling it over in my mind. Then Meg\\u2019s boyfriend starts talking about a dream he had. Meg is saying that they\\u2019re not co-sleeping well together because he makes so much noise. I say to her: \\u201cWhat about if you bring an iPod to bed and play ambient music through the earbuds?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI tried that but he doesn\\u2019t like it when I do that.\\u201d So I\\u2019m thinking this is a little bit of a stonewall; he snores so loudly that she can\\u2019t sleep but won\\u2019t let her do any of the things that prevent her from hearing. So they\\u2019re both telling me these things and I\\u2019m thinking that maybe I should tell them the story of how the double bed came into being. I say, \\u201cDo you know that the double bed actually isn\\u2019t very old? It only came into being for economic reasons a short while ago. People slept in separate beds and couples would have a courtship dance of inviting each other into their rooms. They would either send a runner with an invitation or they would leave hints, dropped like flower petals. It made your sex life so much more exciting to have this dance aheadof time.\\u201d Meg looks really excited about it. The boyfriend looks a bit skeptical but I can tell that he\\u2019s interested. I think I\\u2019ll just leave the rest to them and I get up and walk away. I\\u2019m trying to figure out whose house I\\u2019m in and who all these people are. As I rejoin the other conversation, Cora is saying that they grew up in the house in the front where I parked my car. Her brother, the guy with the strawberry blond hair whose eyes I can\\u2019t see, bought the house beside this one first. When she was old enough to move out, she bought this one. I think this is why there\\u2019s no access road, the family has just divided their property. I think it is so nice to be this close and spend time in each other\\u2019s houses but walk in and out. I think this is similar to the sleeping arrangement where you have your own space but are surrounded by family. I feel really glad to be part of this grouping if even for a moment. It feels really, really good.\"],[\"\\u201cChalk Paint\\u201d I\\u2019m in a car and it\\u2019s winter. The roads are really slushy. You can feel it underneath the wheels of the car when the slush is so thick and heavy that it kind of pulls the car in the direction you\\u2019re not steering, so it\\u2019s a real struggle to let it go straight. I pull into a parallel parking space at the side of the street that looks very much like a street I recognize, which is supposedly the widest main street in Canada. I get out of the car and I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk looking up. It\\u2019s an old railway town. The stores are made of the red clay brick and they go straight up because they\\u2019re tall and skinny and probably have three levels to the stores because they have to plus an attic full of old junk. I\\u2019m reading the names of the stores because I need some chalk paint. None look like they\\u2019re likely to have chalk paint, although one looks like a little bit of a possibility. I\\u2019m just about to walk over to it when I see someone I know from the old yoga studio I used to work at. She asks me what I\\u2019m doing standing there. I tell her I\\u2019m looking for chalk paint. I realize as I\\u2019m saying that she actually lives here. I add, \\u201cDo you know any place that would have some?\\u201d I briefly describe the project I\\u2019m doing and I tell her the look I want it to have because I don\\u2019t want just plain white chalk paint or anything like that. I want seafoam green and a chalky turquoise. She says, \\u201cYes, I know the perfect place. It\\u2019s one block down that way and it\\u2019s called Moody\\u2019s.\\u201d I thank her and walk towards the direction she indicated. I\\u2019m standing in front of the store now and I have my son with me. He\\u2019s about ten in this dream. It doesn\\u2019t look like a place that would have chalk paint, although she said that it does and she goes there all the time and their selection is fantastic and she spent a few sentences endorsing it. So undaunted, I go in anyway. There are kids all in the front of the store and they\\u2019re unsupervised kids probably between the ages of six and eight, maybe nine. They\\u2019re throwing toys up in the air and boys are engaged in a cooperative game of something they just invented. There are a few younger kids just staying back out of the danger zone. I think this can\\u2019t be the right place so I go out of the store, read the sign and see that it\\u2019s spelled the same way, and so I re-enter. Now I\\u2019m looking for someone who is running the store. I see an elderly man and it kind of looks like he\\u2019s wearing a paint smock, so I make a bee-line for him. I ask him if he has chalk paint. He says, \\u201cYes, I do. There\\u2019s a selection right over there,\\u201d and he points. I think, \\u201cHow could I have missed this?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking and there\\u2019s a little shelf, probably about five feet tall by about two feet wide by about ten inches deep. It has three boxes in it that look like there might have been a small canister of paint in them at one point, but they\\u2019re all opened. I think, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s why I missed it because it also has a ramshackle assortment of kids toys on it. However, I walk the way he indicated thinking that maybe there\\u2019s something more here than what I\\u2019m seeing. But no. There\\u2019s one small pint of paint in one of the boxes and the other boxes, you can tell there used to be paint in them but they only have the accessories that would have come with the paint. Miraculously, the one little pint of paint is an antique white. I think, \\u201cWell this might work.\\u201d But I still need the other colors. I\\u2019m not really finished. I walk over to the counter with the paint and there\\u2019s a lineup of parents in front of me all asking him questions about their kids. My son is not in the room anymore, but he\\u2019s ten and I\\u2019m not worried. I think he must have found something to do while I\\u2019m doing this. I wander into the back room and there are more kids playing cooperative games. There\\u2019s a shelf full of kids blocks and he\\u2019s over there and helping some younger kids build something big out of blocks. We make eye contact and I shake my head like, \\u201cNo we\\u2019re not ready to go yet.\\u201d But now I know where he is so I walk back out of that room and stand in the lineup of parents at the counter. When it\\u2019s my turn, I say, \\u201cIs this all the apint you have?\\u201d I\\u2019m wondering why would my friend tell me that this guy has a fantastic selection and it\\u2019s excellent. He says, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019ve got a few more boxes behind the counter.\\u201d I look and they\\u2019re identical to the open ones that had been on the shelf and they\\u2019re also open. As he pulls one out I notice that the paint is not the color that it said on the box. I feel an internal eye roll happening in my own body. I think this is going to take forever. Instead I describe the two colors that I want: \\u201cI want a chalky turquoise and a chalky seafoam green.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell I have this one called mint green.\\u201d I look at it and it\\u2019s far too candy-like. It looks like a wedding reception mint. I say, \\u201cNo. That's got too much blue in it.\\u201d Then he pulls out another one and says, \\u201cHow about this?\\u201d It\\u2019s an obvious blue. I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry, that\\u2019s too dark.\\u201d Then he says, \\u201cHere, well I have these samples.\\u201d It\\u2019s a board that has a fingerprint of paint colors on it with the paint colors underneath. I think we\\u2019re making progress. I actually find the two colors I want and say, \\u201cYes! It\\u2019s these two. Do you have these?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust a minute.\\u201d He rummages underneath the counter. He\\u2019s gone and it\\u2019s like there are stairs leading down to the basement. He\\u2019s gone for about half an hour. I leave the room I\\u2019m standing in because I\\u2019m in danger of being pinged on the head by some flying toy. I go into the other room where my son is and I just sit there and watch the kids playing. About half an hour rolls by and then the man waves at me from the doorway and gives me the thumbs up. I tell my son it\\u2019s time to go. I go back to the counter and sure enough he has the two colors of paint. I pay him and we leave.\"],[\"\\u201cCommunity\\u201d There\\u2019s a lot of mundane stuff that I won\\u2019t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I\\u2019m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they\\u2019re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she\\u2019s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re not triggered that you see her.\\u201d And my non-dream psyche answers back, \\u201cNo, hmm, I\\u2019m not.\\u201d But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we\\u2019re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it\\u2019s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We\\u2019re having casual conversations. It\\u2019s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There\\u2019s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He\\u2019s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he\\u2019s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he\\u2019s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it\\u2019s odd. I realize as I\\u2019m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn\\u2019t stand living there - one of the things I\\u2019ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that\\u2019s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there\\u2019s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he\\u2019s gathered all these people together. We\\u2019ve all brought our own food. He\\u2019s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who\\u2019s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property\\u2019s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it\\u2019s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it\\u2019s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. \\u201cOh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!\\u201d \\u201cI can store my snowmobile here!\\u201d \\u201cI can put my motorcycle here!\\u201d \\u201cOh here\\u2019s a big place I can take my dog out to run!\\u201d So it\\u2019s this whole building of community and that\\u2019s what the dream was about.\"],[\"\\u201cCottage in Mexico\\u201d This dream begins in the car. I\\u2019m driving with my younger brother. We\\u2019ve driven a long way and that part isn\\u2019t in the dream. I didn\\u2019t know where we were going, but it didn\\u2019t matter, it was a family road trip. I\\u2019m always only there just for the family time. I do get the sense there is wide open blue sky and red dirt. We come to a place where we stop. My brother lets me know that now we are going somewhere else, we\\u2019re not just driving around, we have a destination. We drive through a really dilapidated town. The sky has a certain color because it is reflecting a large body of water. It looks like water is not that far away. My brother drives the car through an area with houses. He says, \\u201cWe bought a cottage.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at a ten by ten shack. The bottom part doesn\\u2019t even have wood. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cReally, you bought that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo. Turn around behind you.\\u201d I see a much larger building. It\\u2019s also not in very good condition, but it\\u2019s livable. There\\u2019s a great big backyard. We pull the car then my parents pull up - they\\u2019ve been driving towards the same destination - and then my other brother pulls up in his car. So we have three cars. My other brother has the trailer attached to his. We go in the house. We start opening windows, turning lights on, bringing some things from the cars - suitcases and stuff, but no furniture. The cottage is already furnished. There are three floors. The upstairs is a sleeping floor. The main floor is the kitchen and a living area. The bottom floor is one big long room with twenty tables with chairs around them. I realize as I\\u2019ve gone through all the floors that it has been set up as a retreat area. I ask my sister-in-law, \\u201cAre you guys going to start having retreats?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to set it up as a single family dwelling.\\u201d Then we start sweeping. We\\u2019re sweeping out the main floor first and getting the kitchen ready. My stepmom is doing some dishes because there\\u2019s dust on everything. We\\u2019re taking stock of what\\u2019s there. There\\u2019s enough that they don\\u2019t need to bring any of their own stuff. At this point, my young nephew, he\\u2019s only one, starts to get tired. My sister-in-law says we should go upstairs and sort out the sleeping arrangements. I follow her up. The bedrooms upstairs are small. We\\u2019re counting them and trying to see who\\u2019s going to sleep where. When we\\u2019re in one of the bedrooms, I look out the top window to see an amazing view of the ocean. I\\u2019m standing there looking at it for a little bit. My nephew crawls over and I can feel him tugging on my leg and he\\u2019s standing. I pick him up and we\\u2019re both looking out the window at the water. My sister-in-law comes over and says she has a bath ready for him. She takes him. I find some sheets.i\\u2019m starting to put them on all the beds. I finish that. I can still hear my nephew and sister-in-law in the bathroom. I go downstairs and my brother is in the kitchen. I ask him, \\u201cAre you guys moving here? This is a long way to go.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ve been working from home for a while, so I\\u2019m thinking we can stay down here for up to six months and then we\\u2019ll go back home.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a good arrangement. He says, \\u201cYeah, except I\\u2019m broke now.\\u201d I wonder why he bought this. I ask him, \\u201cWell, did you buy this so you can flip it?\\u201d He\\u2018s really handy. He says, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re going to keep it. My contract is almost due anyway.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking this doesn\\u2019t really add up. I say, \\u201cWell, I'm really going to miss you living down here. Although I've been waiting myself to be able to get a cottage in Ireland or Scotland area, I just love it over there. I can just get something small. But it\\u2019s hard to do those things by yourself, especially if it needs work.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, I get that.\\u201d Then I go down to the main floor. My sister-in-law is there by herself so I\\u2019m assuming she\\u2019s put my nephew to bed. She opens up one of the cupboards and pulls something out. It looks like a long braid of sweetgrass. It\\u2019s long enough that she\\u2019s holding it in both of her hands. It looks like it\\u2019s been wrapped in parchment paper and it\\u2019s really dry, you can see little bits of it have crumbled off. I ask her what she\\u2019s going to do with it. She says, \\u201cWell, I think I\\u2019ll just burn it and see what it smells like.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking through other drawers for a lighter. I turn around and she\\u2019s found something to light it with. The smell is drifting over to me and I say to her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sweet grass. That smells like marijauna.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh!\\u201d But she continues to smell it. Then I see that my nephew is not in bed, he\\u2019s playing on the floor in the other room. I tell her we need to take this upstairs and open all the windows so the smell doesn\\u2019t affect him. She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d She starts following me but she\\u2019s having to walk really slowly because the paper is really flimsy and the stuff is so dry that if you walk fast, it will fly out and get all over the floor which is also dangerous. She\\u2019s walking so slowly that the smoke is filling up the room. I\\u2019m looking around. Now I notice that the kitchen doesn\\u2019t have any windows. We are on the stairs now and I\\u2019m standing behind her to hide her from the others. We get to the next floor and into the closest bedroom. We open the bedroom door and then I say to her, \\u201cWell what are we going to do with it now? There\\u2019s nowhere to set it. Maybe we should just put it out in water.\\u201d She\\u2019s trying to use the parchment paper to pinch the burning parts and put the fire out. She says, \\u201cI think I want to save this.\\u201d I laugh and say, \\u201cI know for those times when somebody else is sleeping.\\u201d We both laugh and I say, \\u201cYeah, there\\u2019s too much of this to throw out.\\u201d Then we both start pinching it to try and put it out. We finish doing that then we wrap it up like a tube and twist the ends - it\\u2019s like a giant long skinny candy. I hear some voices downstairs. We just leave it. We close the bedroom door and go back downstairs to the kitchen. There are two Mexican men and one of them has some paper money in his hand. He\\u2019s talking to my brother. They\\u2019re asking if they can buy the furniture that\\u2019s in the recreation room downstairs. He\\u2019s agreeing to do it. The guy is telling him that he\\u2019s offering him 50 Canadian dollars for each setting. I\\u2019m close enough to see that it\\u2019s not dollars but pesos, but he\\u2019s said it in Spanish and he said \\u201cdolares.\\u201d So when my brother goes down to start counting all the chairs and tables to do the math I run after him to try and talk to him without the other guys hearing me. I say, \\u201cThose aren\\u2019t dollars, they\\u2019re pesos. So he\\u2019s giving you fifty pesos which is way way way less than the dolares.\\u201d My brother is listening to me and we do a calculation and he goes back to haggle with them. I\\u2019m trusting that he now knows the information and will make a fair deal. Now we\\u2019re going around the tables and my stepmother is in the room, too. It\\u2019s dark. We haven\\u2019t figured out where the lights are. The tables are all identical, but the chairs are all different. There are more chairs than tables. I see that there are two press-backed rocking chairs randomly placed at the tables. These rocking chairs are exceedingly more valuable than the other ones. I\\u2019m trying to pull those out. There\\u2019s another chair that is quite intricate and I\\u2019ve put the three of them against the wall. I\\u2019ve set the other identical chairs around the table so they get sold. My stepmom sees what I\\u2019m doing and she\\u2019s also organizing the chairs so that the ones that get sold are the ones of lesser value and also fit with the tables. The men take them out to their truck and disappear. It\\u2019s like a ballroom now. It has a completely different feel with those business tables and chairs gone and just those two rocking chairs and the intricate chair. My stepmom and I place them together in the middle of the room. I\\u2019m thinking it would be nice to have a fireplace here. We leave the basement and go back up. My brother is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWow, I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll ever see you guys again.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, return tickets are $893. That\\u2019s not bad. You can visit and stay as long as you want. All you have to pay for is your flight.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYeah, but I\\u2019d need to bring both of my kids, too, and $893 times three is like $2,900 or something.\\u201d I feel really sad because I don\\u2019t think I can afford to go down and see him when he\\u2019s there.\"],[\"\\u201cDecorating\\u201d I\\u2019m back in the house at W Square. My brother and my niece have come to visit. They\\u2019ve brought some things with them. Everything they bring has to hang from the ceiling. There\\u2019s a swing and a light fixture. My brother has brought so many things for the kitchen that he has built another cabinet that goes where the stove used to be. Now I don\\u2019t seem to have a stove anymore because there are cupboards there now. My niece\\u2019s dishes are in there and there are internal racks so the plates stack on their ends. I look to see what\\u2019s in there and the plates are plastic and made of ivy so they don\\u2019t hold anything. I question why these are so important that they need their own space. My niece replies that she likes how they look. I would rather have had my stove. I\\u2019m saying this out loud and asking my brother his plan for the stove and where he\\u2019s going to put that. He\\u2019s busy putting the new light fixture up on the ceiling. It\\u2019s about four feet long by one foot wide. There are three wire cages that have round discs on them. The last one is a really long dunce hat shaped cone and it\\u2019s just a bare bulb. It\\u2019s really, really bright. He\\u2019s installing it and he\\u2019s busy with his tools. I go out into the hallway. I\\u2019m putting up the swing in the living room archway. I\\u2019ve got a hook for it. I insert the hook into the stucco of the ceiling and I\\u2019m turning it around and around and around until I feel it grab. There\\u2019s not much hook left and I\\u2019m skeptical that it\\u2019s going to be able to hold any weight once the swing hangs from it. I hang the swing from it anyway with the intention to ask my brother once he\\u2019s done with the kitchen to come take a look and see if he concurs with my conclusion. While that time is passing, I\\u2019ve got two great big vases that they\\u2019ve brought and some flowers. I put one on the table that\\u2019s just inside the hall and another on a long skinny table in the hallway just before the living room. I arrange the flowers in it. I\\u2019m standing back and admiring; I like how these flowers look in the two vases. They make a nice diagonal line of flowers when you open the front door. In fact, they arrange in perspective, one behind the other so it looks like there\\u2019s one giant bouquet of flowers. I think this perspective is interesting. While I\\u2019m kind of lost in that perspective, my niece sits on the swing and is swinging on it. I notice that the hook is separating from the ceiling just as I suspected. I say, \\u201cStop swinging!\\u201d and I grab the swing because I know one more swing would have taken the whole thing right out and some of the ceiling would have come out with it. I\\u2019ve caught it in time and she gets out of the swing. I take it off the hook and get some glue and some of the material that the ceiling is made out of and I put the glue around the hook. I\\u2019m sticking the material with the hook to the stucco ceiling and am repairing the hole. I have this idea as I\\u2019m screwing it back in that now it\\u2019s a permanent fixture and I didn\\u2019t know that they were going to stay forever and now I\\u2019ve made this swing forever. It\\u2019s done now. I go back into the kitchen and we\\u2019re setting up for somegames. My brother has made this big chart and they\\u2019ve gone out to get food. I\\u2019m in the kitchen by myself and looking at what he\\u2019s done and figuring out what everything is for. I still wonder at the practicality of taking up so much space for these plastic plate ivy underlays. I notice that I\\u2019m squinting because the light from the ceiling without a shade over that long cone shaped bulb is so bright. My niece comes in and says, \\u201cOh look, this is supposed to go over the light.\\u201d It\\u2019s this beautiful cone shaped Tiffany lampshade. I put it over the light bulb. It not only makes the light comfortable, but it\\u2019s really pretty. I notice as I screw it over the light that you push it in so it accordion-pleats over itself, so now it\\u2019s no longer this long dunce cap shaped thing, it\\u2019s flush with the other two round plates on the ceiling. I\\u2019m relieved about this. My brother has returned with some games. He\\u2019s got a piece of bristle board that he\\u2019s going to use as a chart to keep track of the scores. He says, \\u201cLook what I\\u2019ve done. I\\u2019ve put your son right across from you on the chart and your daughter on the Y-axis and your daughter across from you on the X-axis. Here\\u2019s the point where you are and I\\u2019ve made it just a heart.\"],[\"\\u201cDeja Vu\\u201d The dream starts where I\\u2019m having a dream that I\\u2019ve had before. I\\u2019m in a different country, I think the UK. I\\u2019m walking down a street. It\\u2019s raining lightly and it\\u2019s dark. There are street lamps that are gas powered - the old wrought iron kind about nine feet high. The streets are made of cobblestone and are a bit slick. I walk through the streets. There are some people around and they\\u2019re wearing overcoats and bonnets. The men are wearing hats with a brim in the front and back. The overcoats have a top layer that comes from the neck and goes over the shoulders to the waist. I walk for a while then I come to the place where I know I\\u2019m supposed to go. I open the front door and walk up the stairs to the second floor and knock on the door. My boyfriend from high school opens the door. Inside, he\\u2019s got art easels and papers and paints and everything strewn around. There are plates with unfinished food. His kids look like they\\u2019ve been there but they aren\\u2019t there right now. I clear a space for myself to sit down. He\\u2019s not really looking at me. He\\u2019s opened the door but he hasn\\u2019t stopped what he\\u2019s doing to ask me why I\\u2019m there or greet me. I know this is typical of him, this is how he works. So I just sit and look out the window until he\\u2019s finished with what he\\u2019s doing. It feels like it takes ten minutes. Then, I don\\u2019t even know what he says to me. There\\u2019s just a break in the focus. I ask him how he\\u2019s been. I know I\\u2019m there because there\\u2019s something wrong with him but he doesn\\u2019t know this yet. Rather than say anything, he gestures with his arm that he\\u2019s been doing all this. He leaves the room and goes to a corner with a pile of stuff. He comes back with something and he shows me sketches. They\\u2019re quite good. It seems like he\\u2019s been working on this project. He starts to get his coat on. I know we\\u2019re leaving out the door to go somewhere else. We go back out onto the street. We\\u2019re going in the opposite way that I came and we go in through another door. It\\u2019s crowded and I don\\u2019t know anyone here, but he does. I\\u2019m waiting for him to finish doing what he has to do here so that I can talk to him. While he\\u2019s talking to a group of people, I\\u2019m looking at some things on a table. There\\u2019s a deck of cards. I take the cards in my hand and shuffle them. Then I lay eight out on the table. I turn over the fourth one and it\\u2019s hand-drawn like a cartoon style. The card shows a group of people. I hold it up and see that one of them is my high school boyfriend. I look and it\\u2019s a card that shows him sitting in the booth where he\\u2019s sitting surrounded by the people that are there including the ones that have their backs to me and the ones that are silhouetted. I put that card back down on the table. Then I turn up another one. It\\u2019s his apartment when he was younger before his hair was grey. It\\u2019s drawn in cartoon style. The drawings are done in a black marker, so they\\u2019re black and white illustrations. This one shows him younger working on these projects. So now I don\\u2019t want to turn any more cards over until I've had a chance to talk to him. I keep the ones that are still in my hand in my hand. I\\u2019m just waiting for him to finish. I can hear the hum of voices but I\\u2019m not really listening or trying to pull any conversation out. I\\u2019m just waiting and kind of disengaged because I\\u2019m focused on something else. Time passes, maybe a half hour, and he\\u2019s finished. He comes over. I know we can leave now. I show him the first card I turned over where he is the age he is now. He looks at it and pauses. Then I say to him, \\u201cThese look like your drawings. Did you draw these cards? Did you illustrate them?\\u201d I know as soon as I say it that he did. He looks thoughtful. Then I gather up the cards and take them with us. We walk back to his apartment. I sit down again. He goes back to his easel, his drawing board, and begins to draw. I know I\\u2019ve seen this before and have been here many times. Then the dream flips a switch. I\\u2019m at some kind of get together or dance. I see his parents. His mom is all excited because he\\u2019s coming home. She asks me if I\\u2019ve seen him yet. I say, \\u201cNo I haven\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you should come by.\\u201d I think she gives me a date. She says, \\u201cCome by and have some snacks with us.\\u201d I tell her that I will. I do. His family is there. I spend some time talking with his sisters. It\\u2019s joyous. It feels like Christmas. I\\u2019m talking to one of his brothers. I know I should tell him something, but I don\\u2019t get the chance because there\\u2019s so much talking and too many people around. Then he\\u2019s gone and he\\u2019s gone back to the UK.\"],[\"\\u201cDestruction of Kittens\\u201d The snippets of the dream I remember of last night are of being outside. I\\u2019m an observer. I\\u2019m watching leopards, I think, stalking each other and just generally exist in the undergrowth of the forest floor, like a rain forest. There are vines growing between trees and a lot of colors of underbrush. It\\u2019s quite lush. There are blooms, as well. The trees are tall and thin. I can see these large cats stalking each other in the shadows of the trees and pouncing playfully as cats do. Then I look from straight ahead to the left, so my head is turned about ninety degrees of what it just was. I see in the undergrowth a nest of kittens, really young, the kind that aren\\u2019t up and running yet, but folded in upon each other and sleeping as a unit. There are four of them. I\\u2019m aware that the mama is closeby but she\\u2019s stalking something. I just watch them sleeping. You can see the belly breaths, the way all babies do when they sleep breathe. I\\u2019ve missed a snippet. The next thing I notice is this long vine that\\u2019s being whipped back and forth so it\\u2019s really tight. It\\u2019s without discretion cutting everything it comes in contact with as it whips back and forth. It crosses over the nest of kittens and they are destroyed, splattered all over the area.\"],[\"\\u201cDinosaurs\\u201d I\\u2019m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We\\u2019re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she\\u2019s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she\\u2019s telling me these things, she\\u2019s asking me what I think. I\\u2019m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I\\u2019m doing is I\\u2019m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we\\u2019ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, \\u201cMy coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.\\u201d She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I\\u2019ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it\\u2019s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it\\u2019s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it\\u2019s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They\\u2019re wrestling with each other but they\\u2019ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They\\u2019re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I\\u2019m stunned. I\\u2019m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it\\u2019s winter and it\\u2019s freezing. Now I don\\u2019t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they\\u2019re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don\\u2019t seem to see where I\\u2019ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I\\u2019ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they\\u2019re looking around but their bodies aren\\u2019t moving, They haven\\u2019t located where I am yet. They\\u2019ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I\\u2019m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can\\u2019t leave them in there! There\\u2019s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they\\u2019ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they\\u2019re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can\\u2019t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn\\u2019t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he\\u2019ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I\\u2019m up to now and they\\u2019re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I\\u2019m afraid they\\u2019re going to shred the door. I don\\u2019t have any boots and it\\u2019s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don\\u2019t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I\\u2019m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I tell her what happened. She\\u2019s strangely puzzled and doesn\\u2019t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cDownward Dog on a Shelf\\u201d I\\u2019m in a basement or a living room that has no windows. There are a lot of people. I see my brother and my stepmother. There\\u2019s something I have to do. I climb up onto a shelf that\\u2019s about eighteen inches wide and maybe four feet long. It\\u2019s tricky to get up there. There are other items on the shelf like it\\u2019s decorated for Christmas. There are pine bows and some Christmas cards. The arrangement goes up the wall and there are a lot of different cards that people have sent to my stepmother. While I\\u2019m up there, I crawl onto my hands and knees, then I lift my knees up and I\\u2019m in a downward dog. I realize I can\\u2019t back down and I\\u2019m stuck up there. I\\u2019m there for a really long time. My legs and arms start to shake. I say, \\u201cI need a little help here, please.\\u201d It\\u2019s still a few minutes before my stepmother comes over to help. She says, \\u201cOkay, what can I do to get you down?\\u201d I ask her if she can move the items off the shelf. She carefully takes them down. There\\u2019s a glass dome - the kind that would go over a lamp - and all these other things I\\u2019m afraid of breaking. She takes them down one by one, thenI can get back down onto my knees, move my hands towards them, then back to the end of the shelf where I can dangle my legs over the edge, hang on with my hands, and kind of jump down the rest of the way. When I get down, I realize that the ornamentation has gone all the way down through the wall. She\\u2019s trying to give people some things to take home, so she has more things to put up there. I\\u2019m being asked if I can take some of the things home, but I don\\u2019t really want them. But I agree anyway. Then, people say it\\u2019s time to sit at the table. Everybody, there\\u2019s about eighteen to twenty people, come to the table that is also so decorated I can hardly move. There is a full place setting with two forks, a knife, a spoon, side plates and multiple glasses. There are all these decorations around them, too. I\\u2019m supposed to be presenting a ring to her in commemoration of some kind of anniversary. I find this out just right now and I\\u2019m being told to sit at the head of the table instead of the side. I\\u2019m sitting there and while we\\u2019re waiting for a few other people to get to the table, somebody reads a poem. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, I\\u2019m going to be required to present something via poetry, also.\\u201d I don\\u2019t have a poem ready and didn\\u2019t even know I was supposed to do this. I leave the table and go back into the living room and am looking at bookshelves. They are filed alphabetically. I think, \\u201cWell, her name starts with M, so If I look under M, maybe I\\u2019ll find something.\\u201d So I pull out this tiny book of Psalms. I look under M and it skips it - it goes from N to P, so I can't find M and O. I put that book back on the shelf and pull out another book that looks like it might be Psalms and poems. I pull it off and it says it\\u2019s M on the outside, but everytime I look at it, there are no M\\u2019s. I close the book and look at the spine and it does say M, so I\\u2019m looking through it again and feeling like I\\u2019m running out of time and people are going to be sitting down and I don\\u2019t have anything prepared! So now I\\u2019m just taking a random book and reading through the poetry. I think it doesn\\u2019t suit her, so I put it back. I think maybe I just didn\\u2019t read it properly because I was in such a rush and maybe it would have suited her. I pull another book off the shelf and do the same thing. Then I see that everyone is at the table, including her. Now I just have to wing it. I put the book back and go back to the table. I don\\u2019t know what to say. I\\u2019m feeling really stressed. When I sit down, there is all this sticky stuff on my forearms from the table. I start to brush it off. My brother says, \\u201cOh, I took a long time putting that there and I liked it that way.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh sorry, I didn\\u2019t realize that was part of the decor. I thought it was just crumbs.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m trying to put it back and smear it around so it looks like it did before I was there. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cFeed Your Eyes\\u201d I\\u2019m in a hospital waiting room. I have a couple of people with me that feel like friends. It\\u2019s my turn to go to the desk and check in. The nurses are continuing to do work in front of us. There are three nurses that are all part of the check-in, so the people who are waiting can go from one to the other or the other to keep the line moving quickly, so it\\u2019s not a three part check-in process. The one to my left is moving her line pretty quickly. The one in front of me and the one to my right aren\\u2019t doing anything, they\\u2019re just writing at their desks. I\\u2019m kind of lost in my head, patiently waiting for them to finish up their paperwork, although I am starting to feel uncomfortable on my feet and in and around my hip. I\\u2019m thinking there was no point in them calling us up if they weren\\u2019t ready to take us. Then I realize that we\\u2019ve been standing there for an hour and five minutes. I say, \\u201cExcuse me, what are we waiting for? My surgery is supposed to start and I was here at the time I was required.\\u201d The nurse in front of me says, \\u201cThe lights are too bright. We\\u2019re waiting for them to dim.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s not really reasonable because the lights always look like this. I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s irrelevant and I need to get to my surgery. Are you going to give me my papers or not?\\u201d She huffs and then signs them off and hands them to me. I can overhear her telling one of her colleagues right in front of me that I said the lights weren\\u2019t going to get any less bright than they were now and she\\u2019s rolling her eyes. I go back to the waiting room and my two companions say, \\u201cWow that was a really long time. I hope you can still make your surgery.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes it was,\\u201d and they gather up their things and we go into the area that we\\u2019re supposed to go into next. There are a lot of hallways. It\\u2019s a very busy ward. I realize I need to use the washroom. There\\u2019s someone going into the washroom - it\\u2019s someone who has just had surgery and she\\u2019s pulling her IV pole along with her. I think, \\u201cOh no! She\\u2019s going into the washroom. I\\u2019m already late and I really have to go in there first.\\u201d Then I see another bathroom just around the next corner. I go in there and go quickly. I can feel the release in the dream in my bladder that built up while I was standing for the hour and five minutes waiting. Now we\\u2019re looking for my surgeon. I realize I\\u2019ve had this exact same surgery before. Then I realize I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m having it again, but I do hope we find the same surgeon. He\\u2019s an older man with very white hair and he was very intelligent and friendly and humorous and he told me stories before and after my surgery. I had the memory that he was still telling me stories when I was under the anesthetic because my subconscious remembers some of the fibers. Then I see him around the next corner and I\\u2019m so relieved that I\\u2019m going to get somebody competent. At this point, my friends sit down in the waiting area immediately across from the cubicle that has a drape around it where the surgery will be. None of this is sterile at all. They help me get up on the stretcher and then they sit in some chairs. As I\\u2019m wondering if the surgeon remembers me he says something to the effect that I know he remembers me. He\\u2019s already starting into the recitation of a long epic poem and it calms me. I\\u2019m really glad he\\u2019s doing this. As he\\u2019s doing this, he\\u2019s also telling me to count backwards from 10, 9, 8, \\u2026 and I can feel the effects of the anesthetic starting to numb my body, but part of my mind stays awake. I feel that he\\u2019s making an incision from my right hip, up my right side, across my collar bones, then down my left side. He peels back that piece of skin so my organs are bared. I feel him checking that everything is working. My mind\\u2019s eye sees the surgical gloves. He\\u2019s compressing some organs and manually manipulating them to ensure that they\\u2019re functioning properly. There\\u2019s a long living sponge that runs below my liver on the right side kind of behind it. It\\u2019s supposed to be breathing and moving things down, filtering them, before they go into my intestines. He takes his surgical tweezers and pulls this up and looks at it, making a noise that says, \\u201cOh we can\\u2019t have you like this.\\u201d He replaces it with a brand new living sponge of exactly the same proportions, then he manually manipulates it with the gloves and watches it work. He\\u2019s talking out loud as he does this. He makes the description of what he\\u2019s doing poetic - he\\u2019s rhyming. It\\u2019s like years and years of practice with surgeries has given him this underlying poetic sense of how the internal organs of the body work together. Then he repeats the process once the sponge begins working autonomously. He goes back through the process of manipulating each of the internal organs to make sure that the rhythm they function within is going with this new sponge. He\\u2019s kind of waving his arms in the air like he\\u2019s conducting some kind of music. He puts the tweezers down, then rolls the skin back from my hip over top, and he smoothes it with his hands. He\\u2019s getting all the air bubbles out. He finds little pockets where air is in and he smooths it out until he\\u2019s happy with it. Then he begins to stitch it up. Then I can hear him once I\\u2019m all stitched. He gives my heart an extra thump and tells me it\\u2019s time to wake up. I think I\\u2019m awake already. Then I hear him say in a poetic voice, \\u201cAlthough the sleep is nice, it\\u2019s time to wake up,\\u201d and he\\u2019s encouraging me to do this. Then I realize I\\u2019m not awake. I start to try and exert my will over my body. My eyes open and he says, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s good, I thought you were slipping away there for a minute.\\u201d I realize I can speak out loud and ask why I had to come back and have this same surgery again. He makes a poetic remark about the first sponge that was in there not doing what it was supposed to be doing, but I\\u2019m not to worry, it\\u2019s taken care of and my job is to stay with us and trust. I don\\u2019t know if I say this out loud or just think it, but he seems to understand: \\u201cI will as long as you\\u2019re here to fix me up.\\u201d He feels like a grandfather, really warm and vibrant. I trust this man completely and hope that if I ever have to come back, he\\u2019s still there doing these surgeries. A nurse opens the drapes of the cubicle, the surgeon departs, and my friends come and help me up off the gurney, one under each of my arms. I realize I\\u2019m still wearing this surgical gown. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhere are we going so i can change into my clothes?\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure how I get my clothes and don\\u2019t remember putting them on, but now I\\u2019m wearing them. My friends are no longer holding my arms and I\\u2019m just walking. There\\u2019s a door in the hall and I\\u2019m on a different floor in the hospital. I open up the door. I\\u2019m still wearing the bib thing around my neck, but have pants on now. There is a group of employees in this room and they\\u2019re sitting behind a desk that you\\u2019d sit behind if you were in school. I know they\\u2019re supposed to be standing up and exercising. I\\u2019ve been in this room before and taught here before. There\\u2019s exercise equipment in here. I\\u2019m asking a couple of them why they don\\u2019t want to get up and start to move their bodies. One lady replies with her hands crossed over her chest as she slumps back, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the point?\\u201d She\\u2019s just comfortable sitting there and doesn\\u2019t feel like getting up. I think that maybe they just need some encouragement. I turn the music up and start moving to the music. I\\u2019m not doing systematic exercises, I\\u2019m just moving. Then someone else gets up and someone else gets up. There\\u2019s about eight people and we\\u2019re just dancing. Then I start doing more exercise, like aerobic moves and some people are joining me. I think, \\u201cOh good, that got them going.\\u201d Then I walk out the door and they\\u2019re all up and moving around. Now my two companions and I are exiting the hospital. I\\u2019m walking through the city. It\\u2019s moving from daylight to dusk. I notice spongey stuff on the ground just off to the right of the sidewalk. The road is to the left. There\\u2019s a combination of goose shit and dog poop on the spongy stuff. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s disgusting.\\u201d We walk a little bit further. I realize I don\\u2019t have my shoes on and my feet are getting a little bit sore. The man in front of me has a cane. I think to myself, \\u201cOh I could really use one of those right now to take some of the pressure off my feet. Suddenly there\\u2019s a cane in my right hand. I lean on it to take some of the pressure off my left foot. But I don\\u2019t like what this is doing to my gait, it\\u2019s making it lopsided. I wonder if it would be better not to use the cane and just tippytoe through this, or if it\\u2019s good for my body to switch it from one side to the other so at least one foot gets a rest. But then we\\u2019re finally home and I don\\u2019t have to worry. I want to have a bath then find my shoes and socks and get dressed properly and get this hospital bib out from around my neck. I go in my house. My two companions are still with me. It\\u2019s a wood house. The wood siding is horizontal and they kind of overlap on each other. I like it. There\\u2019s no basement. It\\u2019s like a cottage. There\\u2019s a big room. We have a grey water system so it collects rain water that we use in the kitchen to wash dishes. I\\u2019m hauling it so I can fill up the bathtub. I get distracted from this. I never get to have my bath. Something is going on outside of the kitchen window. I see that the gravel just outside is on top of a raised deck. My two companions are out there with tool belts and toolboxes. They\\u2019re in the midst of a renovation. I ask, \\u201cWhat is it that you\\u2019re doing?\\u201d I realize that one of them is a fairly old man. He says that he has a surprise for me and they\\u2019ve been working on it since I\\u2019ve been in the hospital and I\\u2019m really going to like it. He\\u2019s excited as he\\u2019s talking and now I\\u2019m excited by what they\\u2019re doing to the house because I love renovations and I love innovation, invention. I can\\u2019t wait to see what it\\u2019s going to be like next. There\\u2019s a wood ladder that\\u2019s more like a permanent set of stairs that you can lift and move around. You know how ladders go vertically up and down? This one is at an angle and is safer because you don\\u2019t have to hang on by the edges. I realize we\\u2019ve been using it for a while to go from the ground up to the top of the desk. Now there\\u2019s another room attached to the deck and the renovations are happening before my eyes. All of a sudden, the cabin is more polished with bigger rooms. It feels like a beautiful house with wood and stone. It\\u2019s not opulent though, there\\u2019s nothing that isn\\u2019t necessary, it\\u2019s just newer wood and the rooms are bigger. The green technology that we used for electricity and water is still in place, it\\u2019s just a century newer and greener. Then, I realize I\\u2019m quite attached to the one older man and want to hear about how he built this. I ask if he can tell me the story and he\\u2019s happy to. We sit down in one of the new rooms. I\\u2019m looking for the old room and realize it\\u2019s been integrated with the new room. The moss that had collected on the roof and boards outside has gone and it\\u2019s somehow refurbished. We sit down and he starts talking about how when he was younger he used to build things for his cars, making highways and roadways for them. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s just like how I did with your daughter.\\u201d I remember playing with her myself and how she used to be fascinated with building structures and moving cars through them. I think, \\u201cHow marvelous to start something as a child, interacting with things in your environment, and to be able to engineer beautiful big structures that people can actually inhabit and live in and that function so intricately with the elements in the environment.\\u201d I\\u2019m so happy to be part of this kind of lifestyle. Then this is like an inserted memory from the future. I can see the man and my daughter on a beach. There\\u2019s something they made out of sand that goes up one side, over the top, then down. It\\u2019s a shape. If you look at it from the side, one side is tall and the other is floor level. But if you look at it from the front, it\\u2019s curved. It\\u2019s all one structure. It could be the back of a seat if you wanted it to be, but it\\u2019s not. They made it out of sand and covered it with a substance with some viscosity to it, it might be a combination of slime and water. The cars slide down through it. My daughter drives a car up one side and lets it go, so it slides down the other side. I\\u2019m marveling at the engineering of it. I ask the man, \\u201cHow did you know to make this?\\u201d He takes what looks like a dinky car, but must not be, and he scoops up water from the ocean into it. Now it looks like a scoop. He\\u2019s holding it in front of her face and tilts it up slightly. He has his hand resting at the back of her skull. He says, \\u201cbecause always remember to feed your eyes.\\u201d He dips the liquid from the ocean into each of her eyes and she blinks and they\\u2019re clear and blue. I think, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s exactly what I always want to remember.\\u201d The conversation concludes. Then, we go down the stairs. Now I\\u2019m using that same cane as the other man and I\\u2019m back in the bib again. It\\u2019s a funny redo of the dream. There are too many people on the sidewalk so I\\u2019m forced into that spongy area that I\\u2019m not wanting to walk on. I\\u2019ve got all this goose shit and dog shit stuck in my bare feet. Now there\\u2019s a sole of a shoe like a sandal on my foot, so it\\u2019s squishing all this shit into my foot. I\\u2019m trying to find a spot to shake it off my feet. I feel disgusted and want to go back home to wash my feet off and have a bath. The thing with the spongy material on the side was like an insert into the dream, not a memory, but something that happened in the future.\"],[\"\\u201cFitness Classes\\u201d I\\u2019m eating lunch with a friend at a table. I see that there are people dressed in fitness gear. They\\u2019re walking toward people one table over from us and I can\\u2019t see who it is. My friend says that it\\u2019s Candace. I ask one of the people that are walking by, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on over there with the fitness gear?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, Candace is starting to run her own fitness facility and people are applying for the job.\\u201d I think I could do that. But I don\\u2019t have any paper with me or a resum\\u00e9. I\\u2019m looking around on the table for something I can use as a piece of paper. I\\u2019m asking my friend if she has a paper or a pen. I\\u2019m trying to write my experience down. I\\u2019m seeing people over there who have absolutely no experience at all, but they\\u2019re saying they do and they\\u2019re just dressing the part. I wonder why she hasn\\u2019t asked me because we\\u2019re friends on Facebook and she knows I teach these classes. I wonder if I should even bother applying. My friend convinces me that I should and finds a piece of paper. I begin to write and the pen has a really fat nib and my writing looks terrible; the ink is blotchy. I only get three sentences written when we\\u2019re asked to leave the table. I\\u2019m trying to write the rest of this out but i can\\u2019t find a flat surface. The pen looks like a marker with the tip squished down so it\\u2019s fat and there\\u2019s hardly any ink in it. It just looks awful. I do, however, finish writing it out. I put it in a piece of paper and go to give her the envelope. She acts like she doesn\\u2019t know me. However, I leave it on the table and I walk away.\"],[\"\\u201cFor a Little While\\u201d I\\u2019m in a village. It\\u2019s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don\\u2019t live in houses. It\\u2019s outside living. People\\u2019s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I\\u2019m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it\\u2019s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I\\u2019m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I\\u2019m waiting for her dad. I know he\\u2019s there but he\\u2019s invisible. He has a presence but I haven\\u2019t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we\\u2019re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I\\u2019m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It\\u2019s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there\\u2019s food you can eat with your fingers that\\u2019s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we\\u2019ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there\\u2019s privacy from everyone else\\u2019s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He\\u2019s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He\\u2019s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he\\u2019s still there in spirit but in the flesh he\\u2019s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we\\u2019re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She\\u2019s looking around. I think to myself, \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for the parents she doesn\\u2019t have.\\u201d I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I\\u2019m happy to look after her. She\\u2019s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter\\u2019s father. I miss that he can\\u2019t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.\"],[\"\\u201cForgiveness\\u201d In my dream I\\u2019m at the studio I\\u2019m trying to leave because of their lack of integrity and their manipulative behavior. There\\u2019s people - it\\u2019s almost like something has happened in the outside world and there\\u2019s refugees, just people that are lying in cots, like hospital bed cot in the studio. The studio is full of people. They\\u2019re not practicing yoga or anything - well, not in the physical sense, but they are in the spiritual sense. People are nursing other people. I\\u2019m not even sure what the wounds are because they\\u2019re not really obvious. But some people are not able to get up off the cot and other people are. So the \\u201cnursing\\u201d seems to be more on a spiritual level. So I\\u2019m involved with this and I\\u2019m just circulating among the people, soothing, easing, doing what I can. At one point somebody needs something, so like in dreamtime consciousness, the studio is all of a sudden larger than it actually is in real life. Hallways appear and I\\u2019m going down these hallways into empty offices that have been abandoned and looking for supplies. There\\u2019s a bit of an adventure where I don\\u2019t meet anyone, I\\u2019m just going down this labyrinth of hallways and checking to see if I can find things that will help other people and then bringing them back in, leaving them with someone else who will take care of the person while I go off and then hunt down something else that might be of use to someone else. After one of these trips, the person who seems to have the most issues - none of them are visual, I can\\u2019t see them bandaging bleeding wounds or anything, it\\u2019s just trying to get this person things so that they are able to have mobility again and get up off the cot. So this is where I\\u2019m entering into the busy studio atmosphere again where I see the owner - the one who has been manipulative and lied. She\\u2019s tending to this person and she has a completely different approach to what mine has been - she\\u2019s changed the approach of treatment so that all the things I have gathered, she\\u2019s now said won\\u2019t help and her idea of what will is now being accepted and used to tend to this person\\u2019s wounds. So I just look at that and think, \\u201cWell that figures, that\\u2019s something she would do.\\u201d Then I move on to see where else I\\u2019m needed. While I\\u2019m collecting up stuff that they\\u2019ve deemed unnecessary, I\\u2019m thinking how can I repurpose this in case someone else needs it. She goes back to her desk and makes an announcement like the way somebody at a toast would make some kind of noise to get everyone\\u2019s attention. So she does something and everyone\\u2019s looking at her and she says: \\u201cIn honor of her service here, we have decided to give Freya 25% off of all the services we offer at the studio.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! What the hell?\\u201d Then everybody\\u2019s looking at me, so I have to go up and say thank you. As I do, I give her a hug. I feel like I\\u2019m forced to do this, but I don\\u2019t want to, I don\\u2019t even want her stupid 25% off. I don\\u2019t like the big deal she\\u2019s made out of this, so the whole way I\\u2019m feeling resistant. But as I hug her, I feel she is a skeleton underneath her sweater. She\\u2019s literally skin over bones. I have this moment of compassion for her where I feel through her body, her own journey has led her to do what she\\u2019s doing and in her own way, she\\u2019s helpful and she\\u2019s done this at a detriment to herself. I feel all this inner turmoil also going on in her. I feel sorry for her and I think I should forgive her for being who she is and I still don\\u2019t like it. So it\\u2019s like feeling forgiveness, compassion and resistance all at the same time. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGetting Ready to Cast Off\\u201d I\\u2019m on my friend Lynn\\u2019s sailboat. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We\\u2019re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I\\u2019ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I\\u2019m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we\\u2019re waiting because the wind has died down. We\\u2019re waiting for the wind to pick up. There\\u2019s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It\\u2019s really silly. I\\u2019m on this dinghy and it\\u2019s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I\\u2019m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I\\u2019m hanging on to the mast and sail. It\\u2019s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I\\u2019m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, \\u201cHmm, I could actually fall asleep here.\\u201d I\\u2019m in danger of doing so. I think, \\u201cWell, I better not fall asleep.\\u201d So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, \\u201cWell, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.\\u201d I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I\\u2019m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I\\u2019m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it\\u2019s not in the dreamscape anymore. I\\u2019m swinging around on this rope. I\\u2019m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I\\u2019m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I\\u2019m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I\\u2019ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn\\u2019t get tangled on anything. Now I\\u2019m wondering what else I\\u2019m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they\\u2019ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, \\u201cOh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I\\u2019ll paint rocks.\\u201d So all of a sudden, there\\u2019s another person who I actually work with, though I\\u2019ve never sailed with her - I don\\u2019t think she sails. She\\u2019s been invited to go on the boat. I\\u2019m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she\\u2019s doing to pass the time and she\\u2019s painting rocks. I think, \\u201cWell this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she\\u2019s used.\\u201d I kind of go up tentatively because I don\\u2019t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, \\u201cWhat kind of paint are you using for that?\\u201d She tells me that it\\u2019s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, \\u201cNo, I just came back from Michael\\u2019s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they\\u2019re doing something that\\u2019s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.\\u201d So I ask her where it is and she says, \\u201cHere, it\\u2019s on this map and it\\u2019s marked with an X so that we don\\u2019t go there.\\u201d I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don\\u2019t want Lynn to know I\\u2019ve gone to Michael\\u2019s as well because she\\u2019ll be upset. So I think, \\u201cI\\u2019ll just go to the Dollar Store.\\u201d As I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store, I don\\u2019t have any shoes. I\\u2019m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they\\u2019re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I\\u2019ve got a bag. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I\\u2019ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It\\u2019s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I\\u2019m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we\\u2019re going to cat off. But we don\\u2019t! It\\u2019s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she\\u2019s been sewing something. She asks me if I\\u2019d like to make something. I say, \\u201cWell, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you\\u2019re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it\\u2019s very cooling. So I\\u2019ll make one of those.\\u201d So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That\\u2019s the end of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cGoats and Ethics\\u201d I\\u2019ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I\\u2019m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I\\u2019m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, \\u201cHmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?\\u201d I don\\u2019t really find any. Then I decide I\\u2019m not worried about it because I\\u2019ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I\\u2019m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I\\u2019ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don\\u2019t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I\\u2019m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He\\u2019s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, \\u201cYou have to see this, come with me.\\u201d We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn\\u2019t a yard; it\\u2019s a pool of water. But it doesn\\u2019t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, \\u201cThis is just amazing. You have to see this.\\u201d We bend down and look into the lake. She says, \\u201cLook what I found.\\u201d I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it\\u2019s not made of cement; it\\u2019s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, \\u201cLook! It\\u2019s a goat path.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don\\u2019t understand how it\\u2019s for goats.\\u201d So we\\u2019re kneeling at the side and she says, \\u201cLook.\\u201d I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re post holes.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.\\u201d She presses something and they start to go up - they\\u2019re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, \\u201cAt one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.\\u201d I think, \\u201cI wonder what the value is in that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell they would have used it when they were threatened.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell, then, still I don\\u2019t understand what the goats did.\\u201d Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it\\u2019s not wood that things are made of and the reason they\\u2019ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, \\u201cWow, this is incredible.\\u201d Now other students are coming out and it\\u2019s 4:30. I realize it\\u2019s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I\\u2019m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can\\u2019t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can\\u2019t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.\"],[\"\\u201cGrandpa T\\u201d I\\u2019m in my maternal grandparents\\u2019 house on North Shore Blvd. I seem to spend a lot of time there alone, wandering around from room to room. It\\u2019s a really big house. The odd thing is that my grandparents are sleeping in the room I always slept in when I was there and I am sleeping in their room. But this one particular day, I get up in the middle of the night and they\\u2019re still sleeping. I walk down the long hallway into the kitchen. I just sit there. There was never a table in the middle of the kitchen in real life, but there is in my dream. I sit down at it. I feel like there is the presence or essence of other people coming in and out of the kitchen. I\\u2019m just sitting there feeling into them. I notice the dynamic between them in a way I never did when I was a child in that house. I\\u2019m noticing personalities and why they act the way they do. I spend a few hours doing this in the kitchen. Then I get up from the table and go over to see if there is anything on the stove. I make sure all the burners are off. Then I walk down the hallway into the room my grandparents used to sleep in. I get into the bed and lie there for a while awake. As I\\u2019m lying there, my consciousness wanders out the sliding patio doors into the grounds that are around the house. I notice that there\\u2019s a musty smell I\\u2019ve never noticed before. It\\u2019s coming from what would have been the east side of the grounds. There\\u2019s some soggy area - a bit of marsh - that I\\u2019ve also never noticed before. I attribute that to the musty smell. Then my consciousness goes down to the boat house. I feel this mixture of fear at how big it seems to me or that it doesn\\u2019t seem big on the outside, but on the inside it yawns back into the ground. There\\u2019s this big boat in there that doesn\\u2019t seem like it would possibly fit when you look at the boat house from the outside. The discrepancy between what it appears to be on the outside and what it actually houses on the inside is what gives me that little bit of fear. My consciousness comes back around up to the top where there is a greenhouse. I notice that it was barely ever used. There are a few remnants of plant pots and projects that were started and never finished. Then I go over to the sunroom, which is outside, and I sit there. It\\u2019s still nighttime. There\\u2019s the sense of disuse there as well. I also feel like there\\u2019s some leftover bits of gatherings. I think, \\u201cWell, at least this got some use.\\u201d Then as I\\u2019m sending there, I notice my grandfather is beside me, sitting on another chair. He\\u2019s complaining about why it takes my grandmother so long to do everything. I lean over and pat him on the arm the way a parent would. I say, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s because you\\u2019re so picky. If you weren\\u2019t so focused on details all the time, she wouldn\\u2019t take so much time trying to fulfill them for you.\\u201d He sits back in his chair and appears to be thinking about this. He\\u2019s considering it. I leave him there and go back into the house. I go through the living room, through the hallway, and down the stairs to the basement. There are a lot of things piled up in there. I consider that they\\u2019ve never really gotten rid of the stuff that their own kids left behind when they moved out. I\\u2019m thinking and wondering why this is - what sense of something seemed to stop and not move on for them. My feet feel the cold of the floor and notice it\\u2019s marble. I think, \\u201cWow, a lot of the materials used in this house are very expensive.\\u201d The room has a fireplace at one end. I remember as a kid being allowed to create a fire there but there was no arrangement of chairs around it or of it ever being used by people sitting around the fireplace and just gazing at the fire. I feel a little bit sad at how the basement isn\\u2019t a lived in space. It\\u2019s more a storage place for memories that aren\\u2019t really integrated into life. So I go back up the stairs into the living room. I sit in one of the charis and notice that there is a rectangle in the wall. It looks like it has a little door in it and I\\u2019ve never noticed it before. It\\u2019s very tiny - probably about 6x4 inches. I open it up and there\\u2019s a key inside. I\\u2019m sitting there with a key in my hand. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy would somebody go to the trouble of disguising this passageway into the inner walls and not lock it and just leave a key in it?\\u201d The key has some meaning, and I\\u2019m wondering what it is. As I\\u2019m sitting in the chair, my grandmother comes and sits beside me. She says to me, \\u201cYou know one of my favorite things about this chair is?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt opens up to a bed.\\u201d It\\u2019s a single chair. She shows me how you can push it back like a recliner. The part you are leaning on flops out once. The part where your legs are flops out. A person can sleep comfortably there overnight. I say, \\u201cOh, that is a really good idea.\\u201d I tell her that my space is very, very small. I indicate from the end table over to one couch. Then I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s how big my entire living room is.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well that couch pulls out into a bed, too. If you had these two pieces of furniture, you could double the size of your space because then you wouldn\\u2019t need one of your bedrooms.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a really clever idea. Then she walks away down the hall and goes back to the bedroom. I just sit there in the living room. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much of my grandmother is there actually in this space?\\u201d I wonder if she was ever able to use her brilliant mind that I knew her to have beyond the house. In my dream, I feel some anger directed to my grandfather. It\\u2019s like it comes out of my body in a concentrated shot towards him. Then after it does, I feel bad because he\\u2019s a nice man. Then he appears beside me in the chair in the living room that my grandmother was sitting in. I can tell from his demeanor that he\\u2019s not upset with me at all. He has felt my anger, but it\\u2019s not something he\\u2019s ever felt against himself at one point. We sit there in companionable silence. I leave him there and go back to the bedroom and get in bed.\"],[\"\\u201cGrapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water\\u201d This dream starts in my house. It\\u2019s not the house I currently live in; it\\u2019s not a house I\\u2019m familiar with at all. I\\u2019m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we\\u2019ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It\\u2019s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It\\u2019s beautiful. It\\u2019s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don\\u2019t say anything. We\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cYep, this is going to be good.\\u201d We go in. There\\u2019s an older woman who is taking people\\u2019s names. She\\u2019s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it\\u2019s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person\\u2019s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it\\u2019s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people\\u2019s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We\\u2019re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she\\u2019s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it\\u2019s like a black walnut dark. It\\u2019s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people\\u2019s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It\\u2019s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re standing on. I realize what they\\u2019re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life - they\\u2019re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it\\u2019s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I\\u2019m on a rollercoaster, but it\\u2019s moving through the church. I can see the track that it\\u2019s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there\\u2019s no track after that and we\\u2019re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don\\u2019t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It\\u2019s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That\\u2019s where everybody is going. So we\\u2019re new and we follow the crowd. It\\u2019s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I\\u2019ll slide backwards, but I don\\u2019t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there\\u2019s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there\\u2019s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It\\u2019s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I\\u2019m sitting in, I realize it\\u2019s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it\\u2019s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We\\u2019re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it\\u2019s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I\\u2019m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I\\u2019ve noticed that we\\u2019re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We\\u2019ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it\\u2019s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we\\u2019re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn\\u2019t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: \\u201cHave we contributed to this in some way?\\u201d So there\\u2019s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we\\u2019re just supposed to help make it or if we\\u2019ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there\\u2019s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I\\u2019m asking her if she knows where we\\u2019re supposed to be at what time. She says, \\u201cOh yes, I still have that information, it\\u2019s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven\\u2019t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you\\u2019d be back.\\u201d That\\u2019s just a memory. Then the people we\\u2019re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We\\u2019ve walked down this path from the church - it\\u2019s a dirt path that\\u2019s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren\\u2019t in an urban area. It\\u2019s like non-urbanized, but we\\u2019re not in the woods because there\\u2019s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can\\u2019t see what they are. It\\u2019s not just a dock, it\\u2019s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we\\u2019ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I\\u2019ve recently noted that he\\u2019s involved in this conspiracy group and they\\u2019re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He\\u2019s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it\\u2019s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we\\u2019re with take the cloth off the boat. I\\u2019m happy to see it\\u2019s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: \\u201cYou know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI do, but it\\u2019s not mine. Whose boat is it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.\\u201d I\\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn\\u2019t here and this other person who I don\\u2019t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it\\u2019s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I\\u2019m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I\\u2019m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it\\u2019s okay. He says, \\u201cOkay,\\u201d then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It\\u2019s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I\\u2019ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I\\u2019m checking out the rigging.There\\u2019s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They\\u2019re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it\\u2019s a weird place to have this because normally they\\u2019re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can\\u2019t see what the operate. I\\u2019m trying to figure this out. The ship\\u2019s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I\\u2019m looking at it I\\u2019m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I\\u2019m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they\\u2019re not even ships at all, but they\\u2019re bobbing up and down so they\\u2019re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I\\u2019m off the boat of the woman who I didn\\u2019t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that\\u2019s okay because I didn\\u2019t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don\\u2019t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he\\u2019s not there. So I text him and ask him if he\\u2019s going to be sailing today. He says, \\u201cYes. Just wait there and I\\u2019ll be down at my boat in a moment.\\u201d My daughter and I wait. We\\u2019re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We\\u2019re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, \\u201cOkay, are you guys ready to go?\\u201d We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it\\u2019s right up against the dock and as we look in, it\\u2019s so deep that it\\u2019s black - you can\\u2019t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it\\u2019s so long I can\\u2019t see the end. It\\u2019s enormous. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cGutting the Backpack - Lucid Dream\\u201d This is one of those lucid dreams where you just close your eyes for a moment and your body is rooted down despite the fact that you feel like you want to get up and move. I\\u2019m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There\\u2019s liquid or digestive juices with it. I\\u2019m horrified for a moment, then I think: \\u201cWait a minute, that\\u2019s not an animal, that\\u2019s a backpack!\\u201d The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It\\u2019s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn\\u2019t open it with a zipper.\"],[\"\\u201cHigh School, Again\\u201d The dream starts off and I\\u2019m in something that looks like a school. It\\u2019s quite a big building with a couple floors and has the feel of a high school. There are lockers lining the hallways. It\\u2019s the expanded version of high school but doesn\\u2019t look like the one I went to - it just represents high school. In one of the rooms, there are four large round tables, but they\\u2019re really low to the floor like you\\u2019d see in a daycare. There are chairs around the tables. There\\u2019s a bathtub with a shower curtain pulled across it on one side. Across the hall from this room - and the hall is lined with lockers - is a doorway that leads into my apartment. All I see of my apartment is just the one room you enter. So as you open the door, it goes into a living area. There is some living room furniture like a couch and a couple other chairs for single people, some end tables and lamps. There\\u2019s a closet with a cheap sliding door where coats are hung. It does look like there\\u2019s a kitchen off to the right although I do not enter it in my dream. In my dream I leave my apartment, walk across the hall and see that people are starting to gather around the tables. I see a couple friends from high school. I\\u2019m still friends with one of them even though she\\u2019s moved quite a distance away. It doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s been a long time because we do message on Facebook. She stands up and I give her a hug. Then we both sit down at the table. I\\u2019m having trouble fitting my adult size body under the table - my knees don\\u2019t fit under because the table and chairs are so low. I kind of sit sideways to the table and rest my elbows on the top. Then I see another person that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. She moved right out of high school and she and her husband live out west. I\\u2019m really happy to see her and give her a big hug. She says, \\u201cOh my goodness, that was a really strong hug.\\u201d She\\u2019s laughing and I\\u2019m laughing, too. I tell her that I\\u2019ve been working out and my arms are strong. There\\u2019s some kind of job that I\\u2019m to start in February that requires upper body strength. I say, \\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t always been like this, but I really wanted the job. So in November I started lifting weights with my arms. Good thing it\\u2019s only December! If this were February, I might have squeezed you harder!\\u201d She laughs. We sit down at the table. Again, it\\u2019s hard for me to get my legs under, so I sit sideways with my elbows on the table. Other people join us. We\\u2019ve taken out our lunch and are eating a little and chatting with light-hearted humor. I notice behind me that there\\u2019s a different group of people starting to assemble at the other round table. I notice Lisa - the friend who betrayed our friendship. She also betrayed her own brother\\u2019s wife. It\\u2019s the brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends that are starting to gather at the table behind me. I\\u2019m aware of this out of my peripheral vision. Then I need to go into the washroom, so I excuse myself and get up from the table. I go to the bathtub with shower curtain. I\\u2019m not having a shower. I don\\u2019t remember using the toilet or sink. I just go in and pull the shower curtain across. I\\u2019m in there for a few minutes then come out again. Now I see that Lisa is sitting at the table with her brother\\u2019s wife\\u2019s friends. They all have stony looks on their faces. She has her arms folded over her chest. I think, \\u201cUgh, why is she even sitting there? I wonder what\\u2019s going on with that. They look so awkward and agitated.\\u201d But I\\u2019m glad she didn\\u2019t sit down with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I\\u2019m hoping as I walk back to my table that she won\\u2019t look at me. She doesn\\u2019t, which is good, and I sit back down with my friends. Then, we\\u2019re finishing our lunch and it\\u2019s time to go somewhere else. Everyone else in the room has cleared, including Lisa. There\\u2019s only one person left at the table where I was sitting and I\\u2019m wanting to clean it up. There are rolls of paper towels which actually look like toilet paper rolls. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s a good idea to cut paper towel rolls in half because people only normally need a little bit anyway.\\u201d I remove a couple pieces and wipe up the table. Then I take the rest of the paper towel which is now opened. I set it in front of my apartment door. I\\u2019m tidying up and putting everything away. At this point, a few people start coming back into the room. It\\u2019s all clean and lunch has been put away. Somebody says, \\u201cWhere are all the paper towels?\\u201d As I\\u2019m about to indicate that I\\u2019ve put everything away, there\\u2019s a rumor flying around the room. The rumor is an embodiment of itself where it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s more than one voice talking at once. I can hear phrases like, \\u201cWho would take all the paper towels? Why are there no paper towels? Has anyone reported this?\\u201d I think, \\u201cWh? Was there supposed to be a lot of paper towels in here?\\u201d I\\u2019m about to indicate that there were no other paper towels in here and I have a roll right there, but all these rumors with false information got together and now there were supposed to have been three boxes of paper towels lined up against the wall and they\\u2019re all missing. The janitor is going to be upset. I say to someone, \\u201cWell why doesn\\u2019t someone ask the janitor if there\\u2019s supposed to be three boxes here? Ask where they\\u2019re supposed to be kept. There\\u2019s no point getting all upset about this.\\u201d Then I point with my finger and say, \\u201cLook! There\\u2019s a partial half roll right there. Let\\u2019s use that for what we need and then go and retrace the steps of where these have all gone.\\u201d Nobody is listening. Then I see Lisa look at it. She\\u2019s adding to the rumor that I\\u2019ve stolen all the paper towels. I\\u2019m trying to explain to people that I just cleaned up and wiped up all the tables. I put the half roll in front of the door because I didn't know where it went and didn\\u2019t want to leave it on the center of the table. No one is really focused on any one certain thing and no one is asking the janitor where they\\u2019re supposed to be or if in fact any are missing at all. Maybe he hasn\\u2019t brought them up for the day.\"],[\"\\u201cI had a dream that I got the cover of Yoga Journal.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cKeep it Small\\u201d There\\u2019s some kind of outdoor grouping. There\\u2019s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I\\u2019m not there to particularly attend. It\\u2019s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I\\u2019m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son\\u2019s friend\\u2019s moms, Melissa. She\\u2019s Noah\\u2019s mom. She\\u2019s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: \\u201cHere are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don\\u2019t react.\\u201d The lecturer doesn\\u2019t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, \\u201cAnd this is how you can keep it out of your face.\\u201d I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn\\u2019t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I\\u2019m asking her: \\u201cAre you buying into this? What do you think?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for some time now.\\u201d She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn\\u2019t had any \\u201caction\\u201d in quite a few months. I say, \\u201cWell, maybe that\\u2019s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you\\u2019re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That\\u2019s a good thing!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She\\u2019s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn\\u2019t anything to be outrageously happy about. I\\u2019m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that\\u2019s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn\\u2019t be able to pull so many people into this. It\\u2019s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it\\u2019s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I\\u2019m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I\\u2019m at home. I\\u2019m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it\\u2019s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I\\u2019m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I\\u2019m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I\\u2019m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I\\u2019ve got orange and blue in there now. I\\u2019m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.\"],[\"\\u201cLighthouse\\u201d All I remember is crawl-climbing up a really, really steep slope with rocks on it. I\\u2019m on my hands and knees. There\\u2019s a lighthouse at the top and it\\u2019s on. There\\u2019s a beam of light that goes around and around. I\\u2019m alternatively bathed in light, then in complete and total darkness.\"],[\"\\u201cLima\\u201d This dream starts as though I\\u2019m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There\\u2019s a function, so it\\u2019s quite crowded and there\\u2019s a lot of people, most of whom I don\\u2019t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There\\u2019s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there\\u2019s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it\\u2019s over and it\\u2019s been over for some time. He\\u2019s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I\\u2019m reading the letter, it\\u2019s two pages long and there\\u2019s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, \\u201cDid he say anything to you personally?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just news.\\u201d Then I\\u2019m reading it again. There\\u2019s a story about his cat named Lima. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, what\\u2019s happened to him?\\u201d because he has two of them and he\\u2019s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I\\u2019m reading that the cat is missing. He\\u2019s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that\\u2019s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he\\u2019s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I\\u2019m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what\\u2019s in the letter like he knows what\\u2019s in the letter and he\\u2019s going off about what\\u2019s in the letter. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what\\u2019s in here.\\u201d Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I\\u2019m over in the UK, which is a trip I\\u2019ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I\\u2019m over there. So now I\\u2019m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I\\u2019m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I\\u2019m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I\\u2019m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There\\u2019s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it\\u2019s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend\\u2019s flat and knock on the door. It\\u2019s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It\\u2019s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it\\u2019s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he\\u2019s asking me how my trip was. I\\u2019m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, \\u201cYes, one of my daughters is here.\\u201d Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.\\u201d That\\u2019s all he says. I know from that remark that she\\u2019s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she\\u2019s with some of her friends. They\\u2019re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she\\u2019s changed it to Grassy. I say, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.\\u201d She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, \\u201cIt was nice to see you.\\u201d I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I\\u2019m talking to my artist friend. I say, \\u201cOh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can\\u2019t keep up with it.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019ve each got some of you in them.\\u201d He kind of laughs and I ask him if he\\u2019s found his cat. He says, \\u201cNo, not yet.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cWell, I saw the cat.\\u201d And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, \\u201cHmm, let\\u2019s just go check that out.\\u201d We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cLittle Animals with Trunks on the Movie Set\\u201d This dream starts at the restaurant where I worked while at university. It\\u2019s a continuation of another dream where I heard they were hiring and I brought my application in. It starts by me meeting there with a bunch of other people I used to hang around with when I worked there. We are meeting there and it\\u2019s a Sunday night. We\\u2019re going to see a concert and the reason we\\u2019re meeting there is because the manager or one of the bartenders (I\\u2019m not sure who) has picked up a bulk purchase of tickets and we have access to them as employees at this bulk rate. I\\u2019ve been included in this. I\\u2019m feeling hopeful that I have a job there because I\\u2019ve been included. So, it\\u2019s shift change and I'm sitting at the bar with everyone else. Some of the staff are eating, which is typical - they\\u2019re getting their meal at the end of their shift. Some staff come in earlier and eat their staff meal before their shift starts. So there are a lot of people around and it\\u2019s a festive atmosphere. The people that have finished their shift are buoyant because they\\u2019re counting their tips. The people that are starting their shift are buoyant because there\\u2019s an anticipation of the money they\\u2019re going to make. There\\u2019s always good music playing there. I see people I went to highschool with. Their uniforms are all fresh and I can tell they\\u2019ve just been hired that day. I have a conversation with two of them. The tickets go around and I take mine. We\\u2019re figuring out who\\u2019s going to carpool with who and in what car. We\\u2019re waiting for the schedule to go up because it\\u2019s Sunday night. George, the manager, disappears into the back and somebody comments that he\\u2019s taking a long time to work on it. The crowd is thinning because people have finished their meal or left with their ticket and carpool or are on the floor starting to take care of their section. I\\u2019m still waiting to see if I\\u2019m on it because I\\u2019ve been included in this. George hasn\\u2019t come out from the back yet. I ask the owner who personally gave me a package with my ticket in it. Now I remember that they also had a small birthday celebration for me. Several people have given me a birthday gift and I didn\\u2019t expect this. I ask the owner if he knows if I\\u2019m on the schedule. He says he doesn\\u2019t know. He takes my hand and then leaves. One of the other managers is standing there, so I ask him. He says, \\u201cNo.\\u201d He has a sad look on his face. I feel really dejected and don\\u2019t even want to go to the concert now. I\\u2019m wondering why not only everybody who used to work with me has been re-hired, but these other people that went to highschool with and who never even worked there before have been hired. I leave. I get on the bus to go home. The bus is leaving and it does go down P. Road, but it stops and I disembark. It\\u2019s not just a bus stop, it\\u2019s an intersection of all different kinds of transportation. There\\u2019s a big ship at the dock. There are skateboards. There\\u2019s a snowmobile. There are other things I don\\u2019t remember. At first I choose a skateboard and it\\u2019s interesting because it is snowing. I\\u2019m surprised that as I go up a hill with snow that I can maneuver on this - it\\u2019s a combination of pressing my right foot down, then the left foot lifts up a little, and then you use your body weight and your center of gravity to heave it forward - it\\u2019s similar to skiing. I get up this very small hill then get some momentum and it\\u2019s going along in the snow. When I look down I can see the snowmobile tracks in the snow and they\\u2019ve hardened a bit in the cold, and it\\u2019s actually helping my skateboard to move along. I do this for a little while then get off the skateboard. Now I\\u2019m on some other kind of vehicle. It\\u2019s flying over the snow and I don\\u2019t know what it is. It has a steering mechanism. I am zooming along. It\\u2019s wide and there are a couple other people on it. I look over to the side and there are trees flying by. I can see an animal through the trees. I can\\u2019t figure out what kind of animal it is. At first I think it\\u2019s a warthog. Then I think it\\u2019s too big to be a warthog. Then I get a better glimpse of it. You know when things are speeding by and at first you can\\u2019t see something but then it\\u2019s almost like the thing that are speeding by are so fast that it looks like a motion picture and you can see what the other object is? It looks like a hippopotamus except it has wings and a trunk. Then I see all these other strange pictures. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh wow! This is the set from a Harry Potter movie!\\u201d I get excited about this. We get off at the next stop. Now my son is there and he gets off with me. I say, \\u201cDid you see that?!\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cThe animal through the trees!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, what did you see?!\\u201d I describe the process of first thinking it was a warthog then realizing what it was. He says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go take a look at the set!\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYou know what? If that\\u2019s the movie set, then we could actually rewatch that movie and look carefully at that scene through the trees and maybe see us flying by.\\u201d He gets really excited about this, too, and we decide to do that when we get home. Then we walk back the way we came on the vehicle. It\\u2019s taking us a little while to walk because we need to go back to that intersection of vehicles in order to get on one that will take us home. We\\u2019re almost there. We\\u2019re walking down the little hill that I skateboarded up with the snow. Then we decide to go off to the left and see if we can see anything else from the movie set. We get closer to it and there are extras and the caterers and those kinds of people milling about and doing their thing. There\\u2019s a commotion. We follow along with the crowd so we can see what the commotion is about. It\\u2019s a horse and it\\u2019s kicking another horse. I\\u2019m horrified. It\\u2019s just awful. I can hear the people on the set gasping and saying, \\u201cTake that thing out of the horse costume!\\u201d What\\u2019s happening is one of these trunked creatures is dressed up as a horse and the other horse thinks that the first horse\\u2019s spirit is bad so it\\u2019s kicking it because it doesn\\u2019t understand it\\u2019s because there\\u2019s another creature in it. They get the first horse calmed down and they remove the horse skin from the other one and put it into this pen. But the pen is a pit. There are a whole bunch of them in it and it\\u2019s packed. It\\u2019s so inhumane. They\\u2019re all writhing around and all you can see are these little trunks. It\\u2019s so awful I wake up because I can\\u2019t stand looking at this or seeing this.\"],[\"\\u201cMain Duck\\u201d I\\u2019m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It\\u2019s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There\\u2019s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There\\u2019s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there\\u2019s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That\\u2019s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend\\u2019s son who I\\u2019ve sailed with before. We\\u2019re having something to eat. I\\u2019m not very hungry. I\\u2019ve brought a few things to eat that I just don\\u2019t feel like eating right now, so I\\u2019m just waiting. People are deciding what we\\u2019re going to do for the day. We\\u2019ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It\\u2019s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There\\u2019s a town and we\\u2019ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I\\u2019ll just eat there when I\\u2019m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They\\u2019ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can\\u2019t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I\\u2019m hoping there\\u2019s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There\\u2019s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it\\u2019s really messy. I\\u2019m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There\\u2019s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, \\u201cWow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she\\u2019s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we\\u2019re just staying for three days. That\\u2019s okay because there\\u2019s not a lot to do here and I\\u2019d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don\\u2019t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We\\u2019re back in the reception room. The owner\\u2019s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he\\u2019s going to leave right now because it\\u2019s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he\\u2019s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend\\u2019s boyfriend tells me that we\\u2019re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that the opposite direction?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s the direction we\\u2019ve been going.\\u201d I say, \\u201cReally?\\u201d I indicate where we\\u2019ve left from and where we\\u2019ve tied up and I say, \\u201cThis is south.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo here, I\\u2019ll show you on a map.\\u201d He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship\\u2019s made and we\\u2019ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We\\u2019ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn\\u2019t make any sense to me.\"],[\"\\u201cMis-Match\\u201d I\\u2019m at some kind of outdoor gathering. There are two fields and a little bit of a marker that separates one field from the other. In one of the fields people are just enjoying themselves, random socializing and conversations. In the other one, there is a big table. We have to match five bundles to five names and there is a keycode that goes with it. This has to be done before you can freely join in any of the other games. I was in the social field and then in some way I was alerted or warned that I had to go match these bundles with the keycode. So, I leave. I walk up the field to the table. The little bundles are almost like medicine bundles. They\\u2019re pieces of cloth tied with bits of leather. Some of the leather has beads on the end. In addition to the leather tie is a small tag. The keycode is really worn. It\\u2019s like a piece of canvas with lists on it. The lists are so worn that they\\u2019re really hard to read. I\\u2019ve got five of these little medicine bundles. Each one belongs to somebody that\\u2019s there. I have to find the name on the keycode, then transfer the keycode onto the little bundle\\u2019s tag. The first thing is that the marker doesn\\u2019t work on the tag. It seems to work for others, but it\\u2019s not working for me. It takes a little figuring and decoding because they aren\\u2019t just regular names, there are numbers. You have to translate the numbers, do some math in your head, look on the canvas, count some things, then calculator in your name, then translate this back onto the tag. So, because my marker doesn\\u2019t work, I keep forgetting all the calculations in my mind. I am getting really frustrated because it\\u2019s not working. Everybody else is going up, finishing tagging and coding their bundles, then going back to the games. So I\\u2019m still there. Other people come in. Someone takes the marker. I have to wait and can\\u2019t find the canvas legend. The marker doesn\\u2019t work. Then everyone is finished except for me and I\\u2019m still sitting there. A woman named pauses for a moment from having fun and tries to help then just disappears. I look and see all the people that were in my social group but are now no longer in the bottom field and have left and gone on to do something else. I do eventually finish. The reason I finish is because I just wrote with the marker that didn\\u2019t work. I put it on there even though I knew it probably couldn\\u2019t be seen by anyone, then left the table and walked back down. But by this time everyone else has gone. When I get back to the bottom field, someone tells me that the older group of people I was hanging out with have moved beyond that field to a different area. I start to go look for them. It\\u2019s harder to see where people are here, which is why it\\u2019s for more experienced people. It\\u2019s forested or something. It\\u2019s hilly. The terrain is more rough. I don\\u2019t find who I was looking for. I\\u2019m kind of absorbed by this other group that\\u2019s traveling. They\\u2019ve got a handicapped person in their midst; it\\u2019s like they have hemophilia and can't be jostled around or bumped. There\\u2019s a special diet that goes with this young boy. He has parents in the group. The parents are being irresponsible with how they divide the resources. Each group has five people in it and these five people are supposed to accomplish something. But they\\u2019re giving all their resources to the son and not to any of the other people in the group. I can see that there is in fact plenty to go around. Some of the things they\\u2019re giving him, he doesn\\u2019t even need and they\\u2019re not necessarily good for him given his condition. So this starts to frustrate me, as well. Where we\\u2019re sitting is dark. They\\u2019re at a wood table. I\\u2019m not even sitting at it. I\\u2019m sitting at the one behind, and I\\u2019m supposed to be sitting with them. I get frustrated with this unfair allocation of resources. I\\u2019ve tried to negotiate with them, but they keep ignoring me until finally I release some of this frustration with a verbal blast. But that doesn\\u2019t do anything either. They just look at me, pause for a moment and go back to what they were doing.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Cat\\u201d I\\u2019m entering my house after being away for four days. I realize that I had forgotten to leave food out for my cat. I notice this because normally she comes to the door to greet me. She didn\\u2019t. That was the first thing I noticed. I\\u2019m wondering where she is. I start to look through the house for her. Then I realize I didn\\u2019t leave food out for her and it\\u2019s been four days. I\\u2019m afraid she\\u2019s dead. I\\u2019m running around the rooms looking for her, seeing all the favorite places where she would lie. I can just feel how tight my heart is getting and my throat. I don\\u2019t find her anywhere. I come back down into the kitchen and I see her at her food and water and she\\u2019s eating.\"],[\"\\u201cMy Grandmother\\u2019s Shoes\\u201d I\\u2019m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I\\u2019m at the dining room table. There\\u2019s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It\\u2019s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I\\u2019m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s her or someone else. Maybe it\\u2019s her with someone else\\u2019s face but she\\u2019s not alive anymore. Here she is and she\\u2019s acting like Nancy but she doesn\\u2019t look like her. We\\u2019re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they\\u2019ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad\\u2019s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, \\u201cNo, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.\\u201d I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she\\u2019s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they\\u2019re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, \\u201cThese don\\u2019t look very comfortable!\\u201d She says, \\u201cYou might be surprised. Try them on anyway.\\u201d So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It\\u2019s too small and it\\u2019s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, \\u201cWell these don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d I put it back in the crate. She says, \\u201cTry another pair.\\u201d I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they\\u2019re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they\\u2019re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there\\u2019s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren\\u2019t completely flat, they\\u2019re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it\\u2019s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, \\u201cGrandma, I\\u2019m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.\\u201d They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re a seven anymore. I believe I\\u2019m now an eight. But isn\\u2019t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t say anything, but she says, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can\\u2019t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, \\u201cWait here one moment.\\u201d She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, \\u201cTry these ones on.\\u201d She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they\\u2019re flat and they don\\u2019t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they\\u2019re comfortable. She says, \\u201cYou can have them.\\u201d She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, \\u201cAre you guys ready to go yet?\\u201d They\\u2019re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re wearing Grandma\\u2019s shoes.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cYes, she gave them to me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.\\u201d I don\\u2019t answer. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.\"],[\"\\u201cNo Voice\\u201d This time the setting is different. I\\u2019m in a mall and I\\u2019m teaching yoga. I\\u2019m not in a room so there\\u2019s just posts and no walls. It\\u2019s a designated area for my yoga class but there aren\\u2019t any walls. The mall is packed, there\\u2019s lots of shoppers. People are going about their own business. The people that have come in for yoga have intentionally come for the class. However, I\\u2019m unable to organize them. The time I\\u2019m supposed to start the class, they\\u2019re still talking to each other. It\\u2019s like they can\\u2019t hear me. It\\u2019s like trying to shepherd chickens. They\\u2019re running all over the place. I\\u2019m trying to get their attention and I\\u2019m trying to teach. As soon as I get them organized with their mats down, I say about six words and they\\u2019ll wander off again or start talking to each other or look at something from a window that\\u2019s in the mall. At one point, out of frustration, there\\u2019s a carny with a headset on. I walk over and say to them, \\u201cI notice you\\u2019re not using your headset right now. Is it okay if I borrow it?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s fine.\\u201d So I put it on. He shows me how to use it and I walk back over. It works for about 6 seconds. Then the class is the same. Now 35 minutes have gone by and I haven\\u2019t even started my class. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cOld Wrongs\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of strange building. I don\\u2019t know what it is, it\\u2019s the upper floor of something. There\\u2019s a hallway with a niche off to one side with two couches facing each other. There\\u2019s a long room that\\u2019s empty. I\\u2019ve been teaching in the long room - meditation, it\\u2019s a yoga teacher training. It goes really well. I\\u2019m happy with the session. The studio owner I used to work for is sitting on the couch when I come out after the session and she says to me: \\u201cI have no further need of your services. How much do I owe you?\\u201d She gets out a checkbook. I tell her that she owes me for all the sessions she booked me for, not just the one I finished today. She says, \\u201cOh I don\\u2019t have to pay you that.\\u201d I explain that she does because I turned down other work in order to hold those days open for her. Then she kind of freezes, the way they do in plays where one person freezes then the spotlight turns to something else. I see sitting on the couch across from us, a student of mine. He tells me that she has hired him to work for her. I say, \\u201cOh.\\u201d I\\u2019m debating whether or not to share with him how she treats people, just to warn him. Before I can say anything, he says to me, \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s asked me to come in for the next couple of Sundays just to see how I do.\\u201d I say, \\u201cIt sounds like you\\u2019re volunteering.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, she said that if I do a good job, she\\u2019ll pay me at some point.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you okay with this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cEh well, I was going to be around anyways, so I don\\u2019t mind doing it.\\u201d He tells me the times and dates that she asked him to come by and teach her group. It\\u2019s the other two dates that she booked me for. I\\u2019m thinking that just figures, she\\u2019s found a way to get someone to teach for free. He seems really uplifted or excited by the idea that he\\u2019s just a new fresh grad and already teaching a teacher training. He\\u2019s confident and stuff and I don\\u2019t really want to take that away from him, but I\\u2019m also really disgusted by this kind of treatment of the sacred teachings of yoga. There\\u2019s no way anyone fresh out of a 200-hour teacher training is experienced enough to pass on any kind of wisdom. She\\u2019s just using it as a money maker. I feel this frustration combined with disgust welling up inside me.\"],[\"\\u201cOlive Oil\\u201d I\\u2019m not really anywhere physical. I feel like I am the macro and the micro sensation of passing of time. There\\u2019s a physical feeling of motion, of waves, of something small like iotas touching my skin and letting me know that I have a physical body that exists somewhere. Because my eyes cannot really see anything but daylight itself, I attend to the feeling on my skin to determine where I am. I sense rather than see a wooden floor, a planked wooden floor and walls also made of wood. It\\u2019s like I can feel vibration. I\\u2019m now sensing that there are other people and I sense an elderly man with the energy of a patriarch, but loving like a grandfather; then that softer more active love of a matriarch or grandmother. They have family. I can feel they are tied together by the vibrational quality of love, affection, interaction, and connection. They are bubbly. There\\u2019s joy here. There's also a sense of industry and cooperation. I feel now that there is a rhythm in the dynamic of their extended family. At the same time as I\\u2019m sensing into this, I\\u2019m feeling like the whole scenario is moving forward. As I deepen into their family dynamic, I start to see more colors and form. I start to see that they\\u2019re seated, they\\u2019re boisterous and talking to each other. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a mealtime, though they aren\\u2019t eating food. They\\u2019re passing around something in a cup. Their family is colorful. There\\u2019s something wrapped around the woman\\u2019s head. There\\u2019s the draping of brightly colored cotton clothing, although the man seems to be wearing a shirt. I notice their skin is glowing. There\\u2019s a sense of emanating light. Then I think that their whole skin is softer and more radiant, even of the family members\\u2019 whose arms and hands I can see. I seem to be zooming in and noticing that the hands are luminescent. It suddenly clicks in my mind that I can smell olive oil. Then, it further connects that what they are passing around in the cup is olive oil and there\\u2019s this joy that they have in this olive oil. I realize they\\u2019ve produced it together and it\\u2019s what is making their skin so luminous. Then, I can feel the vibration of the olive trees through the wood. I\\u2019m thinking or feeling that the planked floor also comes from the olive tree and that this forward motion, this macro-sensation is the journey of the olive itself and the family that gathered around it to tend it. As I start to ascend from the wooden planked room with the family who tends the olive, I\\u2019m sensing how disconnected this is now that it\\u2019s moved forward through time and becomes the glassy cage of the olive.\"],[\"\\u201cOpen Air Concert\\u201d I\\u2019m standing in a crowd in a large fairground area. There is hard packed earth and grass underneath my feet. It\\u2019s dark - it\\u2019s night time. The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn\\u2019t say anything but I know it\\u2019s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There\\u2019s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he\\u2019s somewhat hard although I don\\u2019t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There\\u2019s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren\\u2019t sitting down though, they\\u2019re just standing up. I don\\u2019t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don\\u2019t want to sit with my friends. I don\\u2019t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I\\u2019m looking for Trent because he\\u2019s the only person I\\u2019ve seen and know. I don\\u2019t find him.\"],[\"\\u201cRe-living the Move\\u201d I\\u2019m re-living what I\\u2019ve been doing this last week, which is helping my daughter move from a big house into a tiny apartment. I\\u2019m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m in the kitchen and there\\u2019s stuff there, then I\\u2019m up in the attic and there\\u2019s stuff there. There\\u2019s a whole other apartment\\u2019s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she\\u2019s ever had since she was a kid and it\\u2019s all just everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess and it\\u2019s not sorted. She hasn\\u2019t packed any of it into boxes and she\\u2019s asking me to help her, but she\\u2019s not ready. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I\\u2019m in the attic and my friend is there. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s helping, she\\u2019s just sitting there and she\\u2019s talking. Her mood is light and she\\u2019s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They\\u2019re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They\\u2019re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I\\u2019m reaching in and at first I\\u2019m pulling out things that are just garbage and I\\u2019m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn\\u2019t belong with the toys. My friend says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it and she says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let\\u2019s do it!\\u201d She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn\\u2019t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don\\u2019t really want to do this because I won\\u2019t be present for what I\\u2019m packing. Then I realize that maybe that\\u2019s silly because I\\u2019m just packing and maybe I don\\u2019t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn\\u2019t really affect me. It actually tastes like water, so that\\u2019s kind of strange.\"],[\"\\u201cRed Sand\\u201d I\\u2019m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I\\u2019m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it\\u2019s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it\\u2019s actually ending. She\\u2019s co-teaching with another person I\\u2019ve never seen. I think it\\u2019s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I\\u2019ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It\\u2019s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they\\u2019ve obviously already had their asana class and they\\u2019re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it\\u2019s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we\\u2019re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she\\u2019s white, if the whole class was like this or if it\\u2019s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it\\u2019s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I\\u2019m surprised to see her. She says, \\u201cNo, the whole class was like this.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d So I ask her, \\u201cIs this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes.\\u201d There are six people. I think, \\u201cWow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.\\u201d Then I say to her, \\u201cI have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.\\u201d I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I\\u2019m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don\\u2019t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that\\u2019s leaving. As I\\u2019m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don\\u2019t even know what they are. But I\\u2019m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith\\u2019s flute looks like an obo, but it\\u2019s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it\\u2019s such beautiful music. You can tell they\\u2019ve played together for a really long time because they\\u2019re really tight together. They\\u2019re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there\\u2019s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I\\u2019ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, \\u201cGood, we\\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\\u201d The music has something to do with what they\\u2019ve been practicing in the class. It\\u2019s almost like it\\u2019s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, \\u201cI hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.\\u201d We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we\\u2019re at the outskirts of town. He says, \\u201cLook what they\\u2019re going to put on this land.\\u201d He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he\\u2019s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he\\u2019s doing this, I\\u2019m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, \\u201cOh, I think there\\u2019s red clay under this.\\u201d I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, \\u201cLook. There\\u2019s red sand underneath here.\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s just spray painted. I say, \\u201cI don't think so, it looks real. It\\u2019s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.\\u201d He\\u2019s quiet and doesn\\u2019t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he\\u2019s adding onto it so it\\u2019s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.\"],[\"\\u201cScavengers\\u201d The most meaningful picture from my dream is that everything was burnt. It was like a post after the fire burning of the world. Yet even though there was cooled lava stone kind of shell overtop everything that was alive, there were still some people left. So some people had survived. And some people had scavenged stuff from the rubble or had hammered the crust with something and broken off a piece of some piece of junk - like an item you\\u2019d normally buy in a store, that kind of junk - and had scrabbled a living from this. The people that had done that were emaciated and skinny like skeletons with vacant eyes. Their whole focus was on what they had scavenged and made into a business to sell. They weren\\u2019t chasing me and I wasn\\u2019t running from them. Because I was uninterested in their scavenged things, it was like they didn\\u2019t even notice I was there. So I was able to be invisible. At one point in the dream, one of them looked at me and I still remember that hollow kind of hungry gaze and it pierced me for a second, and then I think because I didn\\u2019t return it, I didn\\u2019t need it - I didn\\u2019t need anything it had, its hunger just retracted and then it was as though I was insignificant and it left me alone. They were quite frightening to look at, so was what they had - it was like things you get from the dump, but there were people that were buying it and it was so awful.\"],[\"\\u201cShady Contracts\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room full of people involved in conversations with each other. I\\u2019m sitting with a group of friends having a pleasant conversation when someone taps on my shoulder and says, \\u201cThat woman over there would like to speak with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little annoyed that I\\u2019m being interrupted during something social to do something that feels like work. I look over that it\\u2019s Claire, a studio owner of someone I used to work with but I\\u2019ve parted ways due to her unethical practices. I refuse to go over there and just tell the messenger that I\\u2019m busy. I continue talking with my friends, but he\\u2019s persistent. He won\\u2019t leave me alone. He stalks me everywhere. So I finally go over there just to tell her to piss off. There\\u2019s a pile of documents on the table and I see they\\u2019re spread out a bit. I see sticking out from one of them, my name. So now I\\u2019m sucked into engaging with them because I want to know why my name is on a piece of paper. They should not have anything to do with me - we never signed a contract, though I always wanted to. So there\\u2019s nothing that has my signature on it. He sees me glance at it and my arm is reaching to pull it out from the bottom. He swipes it first. He is her representative - at some point he\\u2019s told me this or I\\u2019ve just assumed it from the conversation, but he\\u2019s definitely behaving like it now. So I say, \\u201cWhat is that with my name on it?\\u201d He says it\\u2019s a contract. I say it can\\u2019t be because I\\u2019ve never signed anything with Claire here or her studio. He says, \\u201cIt says here that you release her from any responsibility for any shady interactions or any responsibility for her past actions. \\u201c I\\u2019m a little bit outraged and refuse. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m not signing anything like that. It\\u2019s a lie!\\u201d I also don\\u2019t think that she should escape accountability for her actions. At this point she speaks and says she\\u2019s applying for a new business and she needs all her past employees to sign this contract in order for her to have a pristine business record and move forward to something else. I still refuse to sign it because it\\u2019s dishonest. I want the piece of paper and I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking this with me.\\u201d The representative says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take that with you. It\\u2019s a legal piece of paper that doesn\\u2019t belong to you.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes I can because it has my name on it.\\u201d Then Claire says, \\u201cYou can take it with you.\\u201d She reaches out to shake my hand and I realize that there\\u2019s a bulky piece of folded up paper in it and something that feels cold, like ceramic. So I look down in my hand and examine the ceramic thing. The closest I can describe it is those ceramic things in old lady\\u2019s bathrooms that you put the end of the toothpaste in and start to roll from the bottom up so that it squeezes all the toothpaste out. It looks like that, but is twice as wide, probably 6 inches wide. There\\u2019s a small chain attached to it. At the end is a tiny hook that looks somewhat like a paperclip that\\u2019s been partially unfolded. I\\u2019m thinking, what the heck is this? It\\u2019s glazed in white with blue and has my name on it. Is this something to mount a piece of paper on? There\\u2019s a hook and chain on it. So I\\u2019m puzzling over this. Then I open up the eight-times folded piece of paper and see that it\\u2019s a check for $201 from her to me. I realize that she\\u2019s trying to pay me for my silence. I still refuse to sign it but I walk away with the check and this bound thing that would bind me to her forever symbolically. Although I didn\\u2019t get the piece of paper with my name on it - I didn\\u2019t sign it. I walk away and I\\u2019m feeling like I don\\u2019t even want this check or this ceramic thing. So I turn around and she\\u2019s still at the table, but I\\u2019m walking towards them and all the footsteps I take aren\\u2019t bringing me closer to the table. I can still see her and I\\u2019m not any closer. This is really frustrating me. Then the scene morphs into I\\u2019m trying to walk through this row of beds, like you\\u2019d see in a television orphanage (I\\u2019ve never actually been in an orphanage). There\\u2019s a bunch of single beds lined up and they all have people in them and all their belongings with them, like homeless people. I have to step over all of them because mine\\u2019s at the very end. It has a change of clothing with a hairbrush, toothpaste, some snack-like foods that come already pre-packaged, like cookies in a bag. There\\u2019s a television there as well. Everyone has their own television and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, I guess this is where I have to sleep for now.\\u201d I\\u2019m angry that I have to step over all these people. I\\u2019m angry that someone is partially lying on my own bed. Just as I lie down in it to get comfortable, these two teenagers come up and say that it\\u2019s their turn to have the bed now. They have this piece of paper to prove it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t even notice that was on the piece of paper and now I don\\u2019t have anywhere to sleep and I\\u2019m mad and I\\u2019m swearing and I\\u2019m yelling and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cFine, but you can\\u2019t have it until all my stuff\\u2019s gone. Get out, stand back there and I\\u2019ll tell you when I\\u2019m ready.\\u201d I start taking my sheets and blankets off my bed, and I\\u2019m taking all the little things and putting them in my backpack. I do that, step over all the people and leave really angry. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cSmoking\\u201d I\\u2019m on foot and it\\u2019s nighttime. I\\u2019m walking through a long flat path. There are a couple of other people with me - my ex friend Lisa and Keith - and a couple of other people. It\\u2019s pitch black out, the night sky has no moon and no stars. It\\u2019s not unpleasant - it\\u2019s not rainy or snowy - it\\u2019s just dark. We walk for quite some time. We are supposedly going to Keith\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s a cottage or something. We get there and his mom is home. We are supposed to just be stopping to say hi to her, change our clothes, and then put the boat in the water. I\\u2019ve already walked around the backyard to see where the boat is. I\\u2019m looking at the water. Everybody seems to be taking a long time, so I go back into the house. They\\u2019re involved in quite a conversation with his mom. I\\u2019m waiting for them to finish talking and I sit down. Then Omar walks into the room and he sits down. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re all talking but they\\u2019re not talking about anything, they\\u2019re just waiting. Eventually I sit down, too. I wonder why they\\u2019re sitting and waiting. I wonder what they're waiting for. I decide I might as well have a nap. There\\u2019s a pullout couch and it\\u2019s already been pulled out. I lie down on it. His mom comes over and sits beside me but she doesn\\u2019t say anything. She\\u2019s still in this kind of limbo. I\\u2019m not actually tired, I\\u2019m just lying down. Then the other guys get up as though they\\u2019re going to put their outdoor clothing on. I think we\\u2019re going, so I sit up on the corner on the pullout couch. But they\\u2019re not going; they\\u2019re passing around a joint. Then they go into this limbo again afterwards. I\\u2019m not sleepy, I\\u2019m just lying down because there\\u2019s nothing else to do. It\\u2019s pitch black. We\\u2019ve walked all the way there and I\\u2019m not going to walk home. I can\\u2019t go out in the boat by myself. Nobody is talking. I lie back down on the bed again. Then Keith comes over and he gives the joint to his mom. I wonder what\\u2019s in it and maybe it\\u2019s not a joint, but just looks like one. She puts it to her lips then takes it away and gives it to me. I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder what this is.\\u201d I put it to my lips. The smoke feels weird. I don\\u2019t like it. I take it away from my own lips and give it back to Keith. Then I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re all in limbo. They\\u2019re high.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cSnakes\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on a path outside. It feels like I\\u2019m in Canada with meadows and a coniferous forest. I see a snake. It\\u2019s sunning itself and they\\u2019re usually a bit preoccupied when they\\u2019re doing that so I\\u2019m not alarmed and I\\u2019m just watching it. It\\u2019s a big snake, it looks like a boa but it\\u2019s not six feet long, it\\u2019s [probably about four feet long. Maybe it\\u2019s a baby boa. It\\u2019s about three inches thick through the middle. It has a really attractive assortment of markings, pretty intricate with a lot of colors. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m just standing there looking at it, I\\u2019m admiring it. All of a sudden it springs, it recoils, and it shoots itself maybe three or two feet away from me. It does this so quickly that I scream. As I\\u2019m screaming I see that it saw a rat and it just shot itself over to the rat. But I screamed so loud that I actually woke myself up. My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to go back to sleep.\"],[\"\\u201cSome Strange Yoga\\u201d My dream setting is in a classroom, like a yoga studio. The floors are wood, there\\u2019s lots of mats laying down, the walls are a warm buttery yellow and the lighting is soft. It looks like a typical yoga studio. I\\u2019m on my mat and I\\u2019m working something out of my body. All the postures that I normally do, I\\u2019m trying them sideways and upside down and backwards. I\\u2019m amazed that this approach is actually working and it doesn't feel strenuous on my body and I wonder why I never thought about doing it this way before.\"],[\"\\u201cSpirit People\\u201d I\\u2019m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they\\u2019re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We\\u2019re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don\\u2019t say anything. I\\u2019m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it\\u2019s on the top floor. She says, \\u201cThis is where we\\u2019re supposed to go - my contact is up here.\\u201d We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we\\u2019re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we\\u2019re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I\\u2019m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, \\u201cWait here. I\\u2019ll be back in a moment.\\u201d So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.\\u201d The first yoga class is all the bride\\u2019s family. They\\u2019re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that\\u2019s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I\\u2019m figuring there\\u2019s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they\\u2019re serving food. They\\u2019re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren\\u2019t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I\\u2019m suggesting we leave. But they\\u2019re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they\\u2019re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person\\u2019s hair. I look and it\\u2019s someone I recognize. I didn\\u2019t know her very well, though, and I hadn\\u2019t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I\\u2019d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I\\u2019m hugging her and saying, \\u201cWow, I haven\\u2019t seen you in so very long,\\u201d I realize in my dream mind that she\\u2019s dead. We don\\u2019t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I\\u2019m seeing more people that I haven\\u2019t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there\\u2019s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don\\u2019t know her - we don\\u2019t have any close conversations. She\\u2019s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, \\u201cOh, that can\\u2019t be good and why don\\u2019t you say something...you\\u2019re passive to this?\\u201d Then her son comes up. I just know it\\u2019s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: \\u201cI can tell whose son this is!\\u201d I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, \\u201cAlright, it\\u2019s time to go. We don\\u2019t have anything to do here.\\u201d So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re just gone. I look down and I\\u2019ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they\\u2019re attached. I think, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t mine.\\u201d I know where it\\u2019s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, \\u201cHey, I think this is yours.\\u201d He looks at it and says, \\u201cOh, I haven\\u2019t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.\\u201d I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I\\u2019m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can\\u2019t accept it until I\\u2019ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I\\u2019m waiting and it looks like he\\u2019s going to disappear back into the store and I\\u2019ve still got this pot I\\u2019m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it\\u2019s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I\\u2019m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I\\u2019m walking into Mandy\\u2019s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it\\u2019s been there for ages. There\\u2019s another pair over by the sink. There\\u2019s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I\\u2019m just hearing the voice and deduce that it\\u2019s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It\\u2019s covered with seran wrap. It\\u2019s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, \\u201cOh, she\\u2019s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!\\u201d So, I ask her if she\\u2019d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there\\u2019s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it\\u2019s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He\\u2019s got hair like Mo from the \\u201cThree Stooges\\u201d but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it\\u2019s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he\\u2019s dead and she\\u2019s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I\\u2019m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there\\u2019s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I\\u2019m wearing my own wedding dress. He\\u2019s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He\\u2019s talking to me about something and I don\\u2019t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we\\u2019re in our bedroom and making love.\"],[\"\\u201cStep-Motherhood\\u201d This dream I seem to be a step-mother to two different families. It starts off and I\\u2019m actually unclear on whether I am the first group of kids\\u2019 actual mother or if I\\u2019m their stepmom, but I\\u2019ve been with them for some time. There\\u2019s three boys and a girl. We do live alone. There\\u2019s no man in the house. The boys are all teenagers and they\\u2019re very close in age, like 17, 16 and 15. The girl is a little bit younger, but also a teenager, perhaps 12 or 13. They\\u2019re all in various stages of self-sufficiency and they are aware that we need to be moving soon as I am. Then the scene switches a little bit and I\\u2019m at another house. The house is actually quite spectacular. It\\u2019s a farmhouse style that has had a lot of work done to modernize it and continue to hold its beauty. It\\u2019s not in a town, but there are a few other houses around. It feels like some other people have also chosen not to live in an urban setting and are perhaps because of their own independence, wanting to live off the land and make similar choices, they may be in the early stages of a rural community. But I don\\u2019t feel that it\\u2019s happened quite yet. You can just see that there are other landowners around. The house has a big wide decking around it so you can stand on it before entering. It also feels like it adds to the safety and the way the house is heated and cooled by night and day through this deck and the roof. It\\u2019s like a wide, deep and covered porch. The roof is tiled. The kitchen is interesting, too. There\\u2019s a fireplace in the very center. There\\u2019s a big big wide beam that splits the kitchen in half at the ceiling. The table is built to hug the fireplace and wrap around it in a C-shape. I also notice the water tank attached to the fireplace. I haven\\u2019t quite figured out how it heats the water in the kitchen, but it does. The dream begins with me. I\\u2019m at the table. There are four girls and one boy. The boy is the oldest, probably 11 or 12. The youngest girl is still a baby, maybe 1, possibly 10 or 11 months old. The mom isn\\u2019t there. I\\u2019m not clear if she died or if she left, but she\\u2019s just not there. But she must have been there recently because the youngest is really young. I\\u2019m supposed to be getting to know these kids. I\\u2019m having a hard time keeping their names straight because there are so many of them and they never sit still for very long. The dad is there at the moment. He\\u2019s asked me to bathe them. There\\u2019s a system set up with a pipe that runs up from the fireplace, across the ceiling, down into the room that\\u2019s the bathroom and into the bathtub faucet. I open up the spigot that releases some of that water and am carefully mixing the cool water with the hot water, putting my hand in there and I only fill it about 3 or 4 inches because the little girl is very young. Then I pick her up from the dinner table and take her into the bathroom. At this point, I really get to see her face. She\\u2019s this bundle of joy. She\\u2019s innocent. She\\u2019s happy - you can feel the bubbles of happiness radiating out from her body and she\\u2019s completely trusting of me. Now I can remember her name because I can feel her energy and see her face. So I take her clothes off and I set her gently in the tub and am starting to wash her. The dad comes in and checks on us. He says something to me, but I don\\u2019t know what it is, then he leaves the room. I take the little one out of the bathtub and dry her off. I wrap her in the towel and go back into the kitchen. The dad is there. It\\u2019s like he\\u2019s not clearly outlined. I see that he\\u2019s at the sink washing dishes. The kids are rowdy as they sit around the table because no one is really with them and they\\u2019re finished eating. Food is still on the table. I get the next oldest daughter who is a little over 2. I take her by the hand and bring her into the bathroom. Then I put the little one back in. she\\u2019s sitting safely in the bathtub. Then I tell the next youngest one: \\u201cWe might as well get you ready so that you can have the next bath.\\u201d I see her face and she looks different from the first child. She\\u2019s quite a bit darker and has a different character. I can feel how energetically different this child is from the first one. She\\u2019s not as trusting. She\\u2019s a lot more independent. We get her sweater off and her top and her shirt and her shoes and socks. Then I think this is going to be a challenge. The bath water from the first one is still quite clear. The other one didn\\u2019t have anything on her - there were no food bits or dirt. So the bath water is still clean and I think I\\u2019ll just warm it up a little bit and add some bubbles, then put the next daughter in. I do this. Now I\\u2019ve got both of them in the bath at the same time. I\\u2019m washing the second one. The second one has hair so I\\u2019m rinsing it with clear water from the tap. I realize that now the water is going to get too deep for the baby. I take her out and wrap her in her towel again and put her on the floor beside me. I think, \\u201cOkay, how am I going to do this? There are still three more kids to have baths. Who\\u2019s going to look after the first two?\\u201d Then the dad comes in and I\\u2019m relieved. I tell him that the youngest one is finished. He takes her with him. I finish bathing the second daughter. He brings in the third one and leaves her at the door. I coax her in. She\\u2019s a little more standoffish and it\\u2019s taking some time for me to talk to her. Then the scene changes from the bathroom. I\\u2019m outside with them. I\\u2019m showing them a raised garden bed that belongs to me. So I know what\\u2019s in there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, this starts as a seed. See how it hasn\\u2019t grown up yet? It will soon if we water it and give it some sunlight.\\u201d I hand them a watering can and they pour some water on it. Then I say, \\u201cLook, this one is already grown! It already has some fronds on it.\\u201d I clip off two fronds and say, \\u201cHere, rub the leaves a little bit and then smell it.\\u201d They do. It\\u2019s lavender. They really like this and both of them are smiling now. They\\u2019re happy and engaged with the garden. I ask them if they want to bring in this and put it in the bath water. They say yes. Now they\\u2019re both excited. So we go back into the house and back into the bathroom. Now those two are bathed. I changed the water when we got back in. They\\u2019re playing happily in the bathroom with me. It\\u2019s fine. They don\\u2019t need the kind of support the 1-year-old did where you had to hold her and do everything else with one hand. They\\u2019re playing together on the bathroom floor. I change the bath water and put in fresh bubbles. I put them both in the bathtub at the same time and wash their hair. I take them out and dry them off. I\\u2019m wondering where the dad is. I go out to the kitchen. The older girl and the boy are not at the table, but the dishes have all been taken away and the table is clean. So i\\u2019m wondering where to go next with them. I go the opposite way of the bathroom. There\\u2019s a large living room with a fireplace. It\\u2019s sunken a little bit and there are bedrooms off to the side. The girls just run into their own room. I think, \\u201cOh, this is where they sleep.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m a nanny or what. I\\u2019m starting to feel more like a nanny, like a governess. So I help them put their pajamas on, put them into bed, read them a story, and say goodnight. Then I come out and the dad has put the baby to bed. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019ve got a little bit of a breather here. The older kids can bathe themselves. Then just make sure they go to bed.\\u201d I say, \\u201cOkay, got it.\\u201d Then I go back into the bathroom because I still have to clean up from the older twos\\u2019 bathing. I pull the plug. The dad comes up behind me and gives me a big hug from the back. I can feel his heart rate and his breath. There\\u2019s heat between us. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s what this is? Am I stepmom?\\u201d I feel a little confused. The heat is really good and I can feel my body responding. I soften into him and allow this. It lasts for a moment, then he releases me and leaves the room. Then he\\u2019s gone from the house and I get the idea that he works nights. I let the older two know that the bathroom is clean and they come in and do their own thing. I\\u2019m not witness to this. Then they\\u2019re in their pajamas and are sitting in the living room. Now we\\u2019re having a conversation with my own kids from the previous family where I was mother or step-mother or nanny. They are all sitting around. My kids from the first group are older. The kids are deciding whose room is going to be whose and who has to double up. They\\u2019re having this independent conversation. It seems to be working out. Now there\\u2019s a top floor to this house overtop the living room. That\\u2019s where the rest of the bedrooms are. So they work it out. All of them go to bed up there. Now the dream speeds up in time. I am looking after all of these kids by myself. I\\u2019m making their meals, we\\u2019re doing some kind of life skills activities during the day involving the garden and teaching them how to cook. There\\u2019s water that needs to be filled up in this complex system of rainwater catchment that\\u2019s heated by the fireplace and dispersed. Some of the girls are filtering the water and putting it in quart-sized containers for drinking water. It feels as though I have done this for about 10 days, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, how long is the dad\\u2019s night shifts?\\u201d I see him one morning. The kids are all happy to see him. Now there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference between the first group of kids and the ones that were clearly his. I say to him, \\u201cHow many more night shifts do you have?\\u201d He says, two. I say, \\u201cOh good. I was really hoping for some help here.\\u201d He has a bag of photography equipment in his hand and he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s picture day.\\u201d At this point I realize we need a backdrop. I\\u2019m tasked with going to the hardware store to get one. There\\u2019s a truck and I drive to the hardware store and get out. There\\u2019s this great big huge rack of backdrops. It\\u2019s like 8 feet long and 5 feet high. I choose one and am wondering how to get it out to the door without bending it. The employee appears to help me. She says she\\u2019s already rang it through. It doesn\\u2019t seem possible, but I take it out of the rack and it goes through the door and into the truck. It just fits. I get back to the farmhouse and take it out. Now I\\u2019m tacking it to the side of the house. Now there\\u2019s a piece of stucco ceiling. We\\u2019re outside. We\\u2019re getting ready to take pictures of the kids. He thinks the younger ones are going to be difficult, but they just come up and they\\u2019re happy. He says, \\u201cHow did you get them to do that together?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, well we have this garden. I\\u2019ve got a garden in the back and we\\u2019ve been growing things. They really like it.\\u201d So the kids automatically go and get the herbs I showed them. They pick their favorites and bring them over. Then, click, click, click, the pictures are all taken and it\\u2019s really easy. Then the dad is finally next. It\\u2019s his turn. He\\u2019s lying on his back with his knees bent. I say, \\u201cOh just a second. I\\u2019ve got a kit for that in my car.\\u201d I go out and get it. They are small pieces of carpet I\\u2019ve cut out especially to cushion heads and sacrums. There are just two. I tell him to lift up his head and I put one under there. Then I tell him to lift his sacrum and I put one under there. Then I\\u2019ve got something different for the background. It\\u2019s made of some kind of fabric. I\\u2019ve got a tin of thumbtacks. I\\u2019m trying to push the thumbtacks into the wall. But just as I get to the end, the first one falls out. So he gets up and tacks it, only he uses the ceiling instead of the wall. I say, \\u201cOh, how did you do that?\\u201d He shows me the end of the tack. I see that it\\u2019s one of those things to replace Christmas ornaments - they come off and you can buy a package of separate ones. He has these in the tack instead and they fit into the ceiling. So I put one on mine and it goes into the ceiling like butter. I\\u2019m surprised. It works. Just as I\\u2019m about to turn around and go back to the camera, there he is behind me and there\\u2019s all this heat. I\\u2019m not going to go into detail, but we make beautiful love. Then all these other images go through my mind. It feels like in this whole dream sequence that he\\u2019s wanted me to fit in and I do, and now there\\u2019s all this sexual energy and love released from him and between us.\"],[\"\\u201cStrange Working Vacation\\u201d I\\u2019m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I\\u2019m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I\\u2019m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn\\u2019t look like that now. There\\u2019s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It\\u2019s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it\\u2019s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They\\u2019re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that\\u2019s really sturdy. I don\\u2019t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it\\u2019s that big. It\\u2019s on its side and they\\u2019re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don\\u2019t really know what they\\u2019re building but they\\u2019re quite busy with it. They\\u2019re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they\\u2019re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they\\u2019re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It\\u2019s a mixed group of boys and girls and it\\u2019s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn\\u2019t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I\\u2019m not really sure what I\\u2019m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it\\u2019s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they\\u2019re doing and it doesn't look like they\\u2019re really doing anything except running around, I\\u2019m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don\\u2019t enter. There\\u2019s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don\\u2019t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn\\u2019t matter in the dream, so I\\u2019ll use the pronoun \\u201cthey.\\u201d They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that\\u2019s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they\\u2019ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they\\u2019re exactly the same length and width. I think that\\u2019s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they\\u2019re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they\\u2019re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you want the other shoe?\\u201d The child doesn\\u2019t respond to me. I\\u2019m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I\\u2019m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn\\u2019t. I just wait around and all I\\u2019m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I\\u2019m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I\\u2019m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it\\u2019s a little darker than it is outside. There\\u2019s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It\\u2019s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We\\u2019re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I\\u2019m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She\\u2019s around 8. I notice that she doesn\\u2019t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We\\u2019ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we\\u2019re in a meadow now. We\\u2019re still walking and the sun sets and we\\u2019re in twilight. I wonder if we\\u2019re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don\\u2019t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can\\u2019t sleep. I\\u2019m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they\\u2019re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter\\u2019s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter\\u2019s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what\\u2019s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I\\u2019m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I\\u2019m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that\\u2019s strange. I\\u2019m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, \\u201cI think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.\\u201d She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don\\u2019t have a bathing suit so I\\u2019m just wearing something that won\\u2019t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we\\u2019d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn\\u2019t very big. Then I\\u2019m not sure how we\\u2019re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they\\u2019re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.\"],[\"\\u201cStress Dream\\u201d i\\u2019m working in a restaurant. I arrive and was supposed to have a uniform. When I was leaving the house, I made two rolls of clothing. One roll of clothing was the black pants, button down shirt and apron that I was supposed to wear for work. The other roll was my pajamas. When I get to work, I pull out my backpack and the pajamas roll is there instead of the work roll. I can\\u2019t leave. I don\\u2019t have enough time to go back and get my proper clothes and if I don\\u2019t work my shift, I\\u2019ll lose my job. So I\\u2019m forced to go out, feeling vulnerable, unprepared, and setting myself up for ridicule. I go out onto the floor in my pajamas with my apron on, hoping no one will notice. The manager does and I explain what happened. He sends me out onto the floor anyway. Instead of the section I thought I was supposed to have, I\\u2019m in another one that\\u2019s called the \\u201cBad Lot.\\u201d It\\u2019s called the \\u201cBad Lot\\u201d because no one wants to sit there until the restaurant is all full, and then it just gets slammed. Instead of the five tables that are supposed to be in the \\u201cBad Lot,\\u201d there are sixteen! They\\u2019re all over the place and they\\u2019re all seated at the same time. The pen won\\u2019t work. I can\\u2019t write down anyone\\u2019s orders. All the blank pieces of paper I had now have writing all over them. People are glaring at me; they\\u2019re yelling at me. When I go to take a drink order, no one can even make their mind up about what they want to drink. They say they\\u2019re ready but they\\u2019re actually not. So I\\u2019m standing there and it takes way longer than it should to take a drink order. There are people getting up and leaving. It's a total stress dream.\"],[\"\\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d This dream begins with me driving through the town I lived in with my biological mother. I\\u2019m making a circle around the downtown area. I\\u2019ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I\\u2019m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I\\u2019m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I\\u2019m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, \\u201cThere was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I\\u2019ve seen those exact roots.\\u201d When I\\u2019m saying \\u201croots\\u201d I\\u2019m picturing old brick at the bottom that I\\u2019ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn\\u2019t so. I just walk away because I know there\\u2019s no point arguing with somebody who doesn\\u2019t know anything and who\\u2019s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they\\u2019re hungry because we\\u2019ve been walking around and it\\u2019s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I\\u2019m making up something I call \\u201cSurvival Juice.\\u201d I\\u2019ve got these big glass carboys (jugs). I\\u2019m putting a lot of roots into them - some I chop first and some I just stuff down through the hole at the top. It\\u2019s a cloudy light beige color liquid. I simply describe it as \\u201cSurvival Juice\\u201d - it\\u2019s a medicinal mixture I\\u2019ve made that is going to help us get through what we\\u2019re going through right now. I hand out a cup of it to each of my kids as well as the people at the restaurant.\"],[\"\\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go\\u201d / \\u201cDreams and Heartache\\u201d The setting in this dream is a campground where people would go with their RVs. There\\u2019s water and electricity on each camp, and huts where they have table tennis and ping pong, a nice shower, the washing machine and dryer and stuff like that. So I\\u2019m in the campground in an RV - it\\u2019s mine - and I\\u2019m sitting in a chair watching the sunset and this really good looking guy comes up and asks if he can join me. So I say yes and he sits down in the chair beside me. We\\u2019re talking for a bit and there\\u2019s some chemistry. He asks if he could see me again and if I would like to share dinner with him the next night and I say yes. So instantly it\\u2019s the next night and he\\u2019s brought dinner over. It\\u2019s a box of triscuit crackers. I can\\u2019t even eat wheat and in the dream I don\\u2019t ask if they\\u2019re gluten-free, but I look at what he\\u2019s brough and think, hmm this was not quite my idea of dinner. I excuse myself and say just a moment. I\\u2019ve gone back into my RV to get plates, knives and forks. I put a plate, knife and fork in front of each of us. He pours the crackers onto the plate and he pours two on each plate. I\\u2019m thinking to myself, wow, there isn\\u2019t even anything to go on top of the crackers. So he cuts his into 4 pieces, each cracker into 4 pieces. He asks me if I would like him to cut my food. He\\u2019s being chivalrous and galant about it. I accept his offer, but say I would like mine cut into 5 pieces please. I think this is funny because the triscuits won\\u2019t cut nicely into five pieces. They\\u2019re breaking and crumbling. He\\u2019s trying to cut mine into 5 pieces and I\\u2019m giggling under my breath. As he is struggling with this, I have a journal and pen in front of me. I\\u2019m writing a song called, \\u201cTake Your Crackers and Go.\\u201d It\\u2019s got song lyrics to rhyme and I think these are terribly clever. I\\u2019m using a tune to a popular rock song and am humming along as I do it. In the next part of the dream, the good looking guy is still struggling with the crackers. I walk across the RV park to the laundromat and I see my ex husband, Errant, and my son, and they\\u2019re talking to each other and preparing some food - now the laundromat also has a kitchen. I sit down in the chair waiting for them to finish what they\\u2019re doing. Errant sits down beside me, leans in and asks me what I dreamt about the night before. I start telling him - I get two sentences in and he gets up as if I wasn\\u2019t even saying anything and just walks off. He\\u2019s gone back to the kitchen. So I just sit in the chair feeling heartache. I get up out of my chair and walk into the kitchen where they are. Then my son asks me what I dreamt about and I start telling him. He would normally sit down and listen or exchange his own, and he does the exact same thing that Errant just did - listens for one sentence as though I didn\\u2019t say anything and leaves and goes upstairs. I sit back down in the chair feeling that I should not have exposed my son to Errant because he\\u2019s picking up his bad behaviors. I worry about that - how he will treat another partner in the future.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Accident\\u201d I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There\\u2019s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There\\u2019s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it\\u2019s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There\\u2019s an image of Ken. He\\u2019s raking or something - he\\u2019s doing something to the land. I feel like I\\u2019ve just finished doing what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There\\u2019s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There\\u2019s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. I\\u2019m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I\\u2019m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it\\u2019s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she\\u2019s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I\\u2019m starting to become aware of the room I\\u2019m in. I can\\u2019t move my body. I feel like I don\\u2019t remember what happened. I see Ken. He\\u2019s in the room. He says, \\u201cYou were in an accident.\\u201d He leaves. I\\u2019m in this room in the hospital. I don\\u2019t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can\\u2019t touch my face. Ken\\u2019s wife says to me: \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s okay.\\u201d I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can\\u2019t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo. Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d He says, \\u201cThe doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.\\u201d The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re so far away I can\\u2019t identify them. I\\u2019m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, why shouldn\\u2019t I be doing this?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, this is where you had that accident.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t say anything else. I\\u2019m wondering if I\\u2019m supposed to remember something or if I\\u2019m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can\\u2019t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I\\u2019m bobbing around and thinking, \\u201cHmm, that\\u2019s funny. I don\\u2019t think I know how to swim.\\u201d Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m back in the house. I\\u2019m in a bed. Ken\\u2019s wife is standing over me and says, \\u201cDo you remember what happened?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThe water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?\\u201d I feel around my face with my fingers and there\\u2019s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, just rest.\\u201d She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, \\u201cI thought we weren\\u2019t supposed to tell her.\\u201d She says, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.\\u201d I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There\\u2019s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s about time somebody told me what really happened before.\\u201d This time Ken answers. He says, \\u201cOkay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.\\u201d Then, before I wake up, I\\u2019m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I\\u2019m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Airport\\u201d We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I\\u2019m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I\\u2019ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian\\u2019s house and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we\\u2019ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it\\u2019s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She\\u2019s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn\\u2019t hungry and it\\u2019s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she\\u2019s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she\\u2019s done this in a bowl before she\\u2019s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband\\u2019sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it\\u2019s like glue. Some of it\\u2019s hard and some is still soft. It\\u2019s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don\\u2019t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, \\u201ceww,\\u201d when I\\u2019m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She\\u2019s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, \\u201cWhat time did the tickets say we\\u2019re supposed to be there?\\u201d She says, \\u201c5 o\\u2019clock in the morning.\\u201d But she says it in metric first, but we don\\u2019t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, \\u201cAre you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o\\u2019clock.\\u201d So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o\\u2019clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it\\u2019s almost that time. He\\u2019s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he\\u2019s getting his clothes on and I\\u2019m putting things into the suitcase. We\\u2019re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, \\u201cNope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.\\u201d Then I realize I don\\u2019t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, \\u201cOh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I\\u2019ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We\\u2019ll still be there in lots of time.\\u201d Her husband says no, I don\\u2019t want you to do that. Besides, we\\u2019re just going into the US and you don\\u2019t need passports anymore.\\u201d But I tell them, \\u201cEvery time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.\\u201d He gets out a piece of paper that\\u2019s attached to the back of his driver\\u2019s license. He says, \\u201cHere, read the fine print.\\u201d I read down and it says it\\u2019s fine to go on with just a driver\\u2019s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver\\u2019s license with me. I say, \\u201cBut my son doesn\\u2019t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, \\u201cWell now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.\\u201d But he won\\u2019t let us go. He tells us all it\\u2019s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They\\u2019re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don\\u2019t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn\\u2019t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We\\u2019re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don\\u2019t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I\\u2019m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don\\u2019t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she\\u2019s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re over at Gate such and such.\\u201d So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they\\u2019ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that\\u2019s great, although I\\u2019m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don\\u2019t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Arrangement\\u201d The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor\\u2019s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It\\u2019s some kind of reception, but I\\u2019m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don\\u2019t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he\\u2019s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he\\u2019s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I\\u2019ve earned it. I see in my mind\\u2019s eyes the word, \\u201cPlacement\\u201d on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I\\u2019m talking to them and realize I\\u2019m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It\\u2019s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There\\u2019s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It\\u2019s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It\\u2019s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he\\u2019s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I\\u2019m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I\\u2019m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I\\u2019m moving from one group to another making sure they\\u2019re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I\\u2019m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I\\u2019m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I\\u2019m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It\\u2019s hard for me to do this. I\\u2019m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It\\u2019s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There\\u2019s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I\\u2019m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don\\u2019t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll just sit with you.\\u201d This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There\\u2019s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It\\u2019s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it\\u2019s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I\\u2019m just now understanding this. So I\\u2019m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven\\u2019t had any time to get to know each other. I don\\u2019t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They\\u2019re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what\\u2019s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don\\u2019t. But my arranged husband does. There\\u2019s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we\\u2019re all in my arranged husband\\u2019s car and driving up towards his house. It\\u2019s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I\\u2019m responsible for making food. I\\u2019ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They\\u2019re working on a collaborative project. I\\u2019m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, \\u201cWell, is there anything else I can eat? I\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHere.\\u201d I say here, \\u201cYou can make the toast.\\u201d I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I\\u2019m feeling more at home. I\\u2019m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I\\u2019m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There\\u2019s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I\\u2019ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon. She says, \\u201cNo, all we have is on the racks.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve chosen this chapter book I thought he would like and see it. I tell him that\\u2019s not the book I wanted to get him and describe the stories in the book that I wanted to give him. This builds a little bit more of a bridge between us.\"],[\"\\u201cThe ATM\\u201d I\\u2019m in a lineup in the bank. My son is with me. I\\u2019ve got cash and gift cards to deposit. I\\u2019m twelfth in line and when I get to be second in line, I start to organize my piles of cash and gift cards. I realize that I cannot find my bank card, although I know it\\u2019s in my purse. So I\\u2019m disorganized and have too many things in my hands and there is too much stuff in my wallet that is not a bank card. As I\\u2019m trying to juggle all these different piles of things, I now become the first person in line and it\\u2019s my turn. I still can\\u2019t find my bank card. I say to the couple behind me - a man and a woman who appear to know each other and have been chatting happily the whole time - \\u201cI need to set my stuff down on the floor. I can\\u2019t find my bank card. I know it\\u2019s here. Feel free to go ahead.\\u201d They do and I can still hear them chatting happily with each other. I\\u2019ve spread everything out on the floor and sort through them. I\\u2019ve got envelopes opened with bills I\\u2019ve looked at and returned. There are things from my son\\u2019s birthday party. There are gift cards for McDonald\\u2019s that I know we\\u2019ll never use because we don\\u2019t eat there, but we can deposit them into our bank account. I finally locate my bank card. Every time I thought I located my bank card, I would look at it and it was a replica of a bank card but wasn\\u2019t a bank card. It keeps getting into the pile of things to deposit into the ATM by accident because it looks so much like a bank card but it\\u2019s not one. Although when I\\u2019m finally read to make my deposit, the couple that was chatting happily has gone and there are different people who are ready to have their turn. I walk up with my son and say to the person who\\u2019s next: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been looking for my bank card and have already been waiting in this line. Is it okay if I go next?\\u201d They\\u2019re quite happy to let me go. I get there and the screen is like an electronic game board - like \\u201cSnakes and Ladders\\u201d or \\u201cGame of Life\\u201d or \\u201cMouse Trap\\u201d or one of those really colorful game boards for kids with lights and red, green and yellow. I try to put my bank card in and realize it\\u2019s this dummy bank card again. I pull it out and am trying to sift through. I have different deposits in between each finger and thumb as if my hand is a categorized sorter. I know I\\u2019m taking a really long time. The bank machine spits out the pseudo bank card. I ask my son if he\\u2019ll hold a couple things. I\\u2019m still trying to get the bank card. I turn around and explain to the person behind me: \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. The machine keeps rejecting my card.\\u201d Then, I locate the real bank card and put it in. Now it\\u2019s asking me to select from one of the buttons underneath if I want to deposit gift cards. The button is really tiny. There are three buttons you can press and they\\u2019re all really close together. I keep trying to push the one button. Finally it works. Every time you push a button, a whole bunch of other things light up on this screen. There are pictures of circus people and they aren\\u2019t just pictures, they\\u2019re animated parts that are moving. I get the gift card thing to work and insert them one at a time. On the screen, which is quite large - probably 12x12 - it\\u2019s like a record of your deposits and says exactly what you deposited and how much the gift card was worth. So I\\u2019m feeding four gift cards in. Then it tells me what bills I need to pay. I had the bills all organized. You have to push each bill into the machine to pay your bills. I think I\\u2019m almost done when the bank teller comes out with three big boxes of past records of bill payments. I\\u2019m unprepared to deal with all of this. I finish my transaction and allow the ATM to return my card so someone else can have their turn. I thank the person behind me for waiting patiently. Then I look at what's in these boxes. It is my whole life, everywhere I\\u2019ve lived, as if the bank has kept records of this and it\\u2019s all in the boxes and sorted sequentially in years and months in a proper sorting job. All of these envelopes have been opened with transaction receipts that are on letterhead folded in threes and put back in the envelope and sorted chronologically. It goes all the way back through every relationship I\\u2019ve ever had prior to my daughter\\u2019s birth with all the different houses I\\u2019ve lived in, everywhere I\\u2019ve traveled. I think that I\\u2019ve taken care of this. I\\u2019ve paid my taxes. I didn\\u2019t even know there were records that this stuff existed. I decide to just shred them and not even attempt to go through all these boxes and take everything out to look at it. I\\u2019m done with that. I\\u2019m good. I pick the boxes up. I walk around the giant line of people waiting for the ATM. I notice the material of the floors and walls. I notice the architecture of the building. Everything is made of marble. Feet click on the marble. It\\u2019s very ostentatious, yet it is quite simple. I guess it\\u2019s like an expensive institution style architecture without a lot of external trappings; it\\u2019s all straight and linear, boxed. The ceiling, however, is really high. I\\u2019m standing at the teller waiting to say that these things need to be shredded. I see the woman who was part of the couple chatting happily. She\\u2019s telling one of the tellers that now there is a hot studio on the top floor of this building. She\\u2019s pretty happy about this and she\\u2019s going to go up there and try it. I think to myself, \\u201cWow, that seems odd that there would be a hot yoga studio on the twelfth floor of a bank institution.\\u201d I watch her go upstairs. She\\u2019s dressed really colorfully. She\\u2019s wearing a tan mini skirt and bright pink jacket that almost meets the hem of the mini skirt. I watch her walk up the stairs. The teller takes my boxes. I say, \\u201cPlease just shred these.\\u201d Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Attacks\\u201d My dream last night was a nightmare. It starts in the town where I grew up. I\\u2019m in front of the house that I lived in when I was growing up. I\\u2019m sitting on the grass in the front lawn and I see a person but it\\u2019s not clearly identified features. I\\u2019m just somehow in my dream saying it\\u2019s a man. The man is running and shouting angrily. I feel threatened so I start to back up. The person runs into my neighbor\\u2019s house on the right. I can\\u2019t go in my own house because I'm not safe there so I sneak around the side of my house and am hiding in the backyard. I hear screaming and yelling and commotion. The man comes out of my neighbor\\u2019s house and starts coming back up towards my house and goes in - nothing happens because no one\\u2019s in there - and comes out. I realize that he is sneaking or stalking around the perimeter of my own house. So I avoid him but he\\u2019s not far behind and I don\\u2019t know where to go that\\u2019s safe. I notice that my other neighbor\\u2019s side door is open a little bit and I\\u2019m feeling kind of bad about going into the house without knocking, but if I don\\u2019t run in and close the door and lock it, then that thing will get me. So I run in, close the door and lock it and the lady that owns the house looks at me and says, \\u201cOh! What are you doing in here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cQuick! Lock the front door! There\\u2019s an angry person!\\u201d (but I don\\u2019t call it that in the dream. I\\u2019ve given it a name and the name escapes me). I warn her, so she does and we listen and it\\u2019s yelling angrily and pounding at the door and trying to get in, but it doesn\\u2019t. But while it\\u2019s trying, I tell her that it\\u2019s been chasing me for ages and I\\u2019m really sorry for invading your privacy, but I needed to come in here or it would kill me. She says that\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s alright. She calmly looks at me and says, \\u201cFreya, what have you been doing? I never see you anymore.\\u201d So she\\u2019s talking to me and she\\u2019s kind of oblivious that this thing is out there. And then our small talk finishes. It\\u2019s quiet. It\\u2019s been quiet. I hover by the inside of her side door, waiting and waiting. I finally decide to open the door a crack, take a peek out, look around, there\\u2019s nothing. So I decide to leave and I go out of her house. I start walking up the street. Just as I get part way up, there it is again! It\\u2019s chasing me again, so I\\u2019m running and I can feel my breath getting caught in my throat and I\\u2019m getting out of breath and my legs start to hurt but I keep running and running and running. All of a sudden, that town turns into the town where I currently live. I\\u2019m coming towards the main street and I don\\u2019t know where to go because it\\u2019s dark out, nothing\\u2019s open, I don\\u2019t know anyone there. Then I realize that my friend lives about a block away and I might be able to make it to his house. So I do. This thing is behind me! I can hear it and it\\u2019s like just almost within a grasp of me the whole time. I make it to my friend\\u2019s apartment building and again I\\u2019m feeling the same kind of thing as I did in my neighbor\\u2019s house where I don\\u2019t feel right about barging in without knocking or without asking if it\\u2019s okay to come over or any of those things you do before you go over to someone else\\u2019s house. His door is slightly ajar and I run in, close the door and do up all the locks. I\\u2019m standing there and I can hear this thing on the outside, and it\\u2019s like snuffling around almost animal-like. I can feel its fingers tracing the outline of the door, looking for some way to come in. I back away really really slowly. I see my friend lying on the couch in his living room. He\\u2019s resigin. He\\u2019s having a nap. So I quietly sneak down into one of the bedrooms. I sit there. Some time passes and I\\u2019m listening for this thing and now I can hear it outside the apartment building trying to find a different way in. I don\\u2019t look out the window because I\\u2019m afraid it will see me. And then my friend wakes up and he\\u2019s over by the bedroom door, and I\\u2019m like shh with my finger over my mouth. I indicate to go to the middle of the apartment. The kitchen is actually in the middle. We go over there and I tell him, \\u201cI hope you don\\u2019t mind me coming in. There\\u2019s this thing chasing me and everywhere I go, it manages to break in the door or smash a window.\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d So he tells me to just make myself comfortable and I do. He, my friend, goes about his regular tasks. He\\u2019s putting his things in his case and collecting up textbooks and he\\u2019s packing his lunch. He gets dressed and I\\u2019m still sitting there waiting and waiting. I\\u2019m nervous that he\\u2019s going to open the door and that thing will get in and find me. But he tells me to lock the door behind him, he opens the door, there\\u2019s nothing there. He goes to work and then I lock the doors behind him. So now I\\u2019m sitting in his apartment. I don\\u2019t have any of my own stuff. There\\u2019s not really anything to do. So I go in and wash the dishes because there\\u2019s nothing else to do. Then I\\u2019m sitting in the living room staring at the walls, feeling slightly trapped. I\\u2019m not calm. I can feel how tense and wired my body is. Then I sense that there\\u2019s somebody in one of the back bedrooms. So I go in there and my daughter\\u2019s in there and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! You\\u2019re here!\\u201d Then I notice that my cats have appeared - they are in the apartment too. I go into the other room and there\\u2019s my son. So now everybody\\u2019s in here and they\\u2019re safe. Okay, this is a good thing. Now, what are we going to do about food and clothing. I go over to one of the dressars and suddenly there\\u2019s clothing for us in one of the dressars. I go out to the kitchen and there\\u2019s no shortage of food - why would there be, somebody lives there. So I prepare my kids something to eat. I\\u2019m warning them, though, not to make too much noise or turn on many lights because that thing might get us. Then the day passes. We have some idle chit chat, patting the cats, and just kind of mindlessly arranging the furniture so we\\u2019ll fit in there - just slightly small. And then my friend comes back home from work and he\\u2019s just in there. I don\\u2019t actually see him come in the door, so there\\u2019s no fear about the door - that\\u2019s not revisited. He\\u2019s just in there again and I still feel tense that now we\\u2019re wearing different clothes and we\\u2019ve made food and now my cats and my kids are in there. And I\\u2019m scared because this is a huge invasion of his privacy. I don\\u2019t know where his dog went - he actually has a dog that would be some concern with the cats, but the dog doesn\\u2019t seem to be there. He\\u2019s a single dad and his two kids - the one son just comes and goes freely and the daughter is two weeks on, two weeks off. So I'm tense about this and he says, no that\\u2019s fine, don\\u2019t worry about it, and he says, come here, and he gives me a big hug and says, lie down. And he\\u2019s just hugging me. I can feel myself start to relax. I feel the tension slide away from my body. I accept that I\\u2019m safe. It happens gradually - as this hug is happening, a day passes and a night passes and a day passes and a night passes, and then I accept that okay, this is the right place to hide and it\\u2019s okay. My daughter has started to come and go freely. My son hasn\\u2019t. My friend\\u2019s kids are in their own routine and they get along fine. My son has taken an interest in his daughter - she is unique - and my son is very nurturing. The two of them have formed some kind of bond and that doesn\\u2019t surprise me because my son loves younger kids. So some semblance of normalcy has formed in my environment. I still want to go home, but I know I can\\u2019t and for now, this is working fine and people are happy.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Barge\\u201d A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It\\u2019s quite intricate and detailed. I\\u2019m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don\\u2019t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we\\u2019re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I\\u2019ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I\\u2019m just standing there. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m at a really large lake or an ocean. I\\u2019m just watching. I\\u2019m looking at the water. You can\\u2019t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It\\u2019s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It\\u2019s also very balmy and a bit windy. I\\u2019m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It\\u2019s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They\\u2019re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I\\u2019m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I\\u2019m being told that it\\u2019s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it\\u2019s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we\\u2019re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I\\u2019m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I\\u2019m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don\\u2019t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I\\u2019ve been with before. I don\\u2019t try to join them because they\\u2019re in a family grouping. There\\u2019s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don\\u2019t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I\\u2019ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what\\u2019s there. There are muffins. But I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re gluten-free and I know I can\\u2019t eat wheat, so I don\\u2019t get them. There\\u2019s something else on the table. I\\u2019m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she\\u2019s too short and can\\u2019t reach it. I\\u2019m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, \\u201cMy mom said I can have one.\\u201d So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, \\u201cJust a minute, let\\u2019s find your parents.\\u201d She points further up the pier and says, \\u201cThey\\u2019re over there.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t see anybody. She\\u2019s fairly determined and tugging me. We\\u2019re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It\\u2019s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, \\u201cOh look! It\\u2019s garbage day.\\u201d So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It\\u2019s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I\\u2019m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there\\u2019s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it\\u2019s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that\\u2019s on the pier. I think. \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d The post is still standing. I think that\\u2019s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, \\u201cWhat are you doing here? You\\u2019re not supposed to be here.\\u201d I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they\\u2019re supposed to be here. He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see anyone.\\u201d I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there\\u2019s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they\\u2019ve all been in this trauma but she\\u2019s not going to go because she\\u2019s not ready. Now I\\u2019m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I\\u2019m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I\\u2019ve got my laptop with me and I don\\u2019t want to take it. I say to her, \\u201cIs it okay if I leave this in your room?\\u201d She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I\\u2019m getting into a Jeep. It\\u2019s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they\\u2019re all cut out for open air. So I\\u2019m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it\\u2019s cleared out and doesn\\u2019t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There\\u2019s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they\\u2019re with. I don\\u2019t have a \\u201cwhoever I\\u2019m with\\u201d so I don\\u2019t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It\\u2019s quite pleasant. You can\\u2019t see the sun overhead, though. There\\u2019s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It\\u2019s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don\\u2019t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven\\u2019t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don\\u2019t know what time we\\u2019re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don\\u2019t see any. At one point the day feels like it\\u2019s gone on. I am hungry but I don\\u2019t have any food. I\\u2019m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren\\u2019t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I\\u2019m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I\\u2019m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they\\u2019re having together and they don\\u2019t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I\\u2019m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I\\u2019m looking for staff to help me. I\\u2019m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I\\u2019m going to miss supper as well. I\\u2019ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bathroom\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house this time. It\\u2019s a turn of the century home. It\\u2019s a fairly big brick house. Everything on the inside is made of wood - the floors, railings and banisters. There is wainscotting on the walls and crown molding. It has that lovely creaking sound everywhere where your feet walk. The house creaks. The doors creak. When you walk up and down the stairs, the stairs creak. It\\u2019s also built in a square. So, the stairs would go up one side of the house and down the other side, so that there can be a wood stove or something in the middle that heats the upper floor bedrooms at night when people are sleeping or even when the weather is cold. My room is on the second floor. One wall would be the windows looking to the outside, and opposite that would be the door that goes into the hallway. The hallway has a banister on one side that goes around in a square around the middle. So the hallway is actually quite a long tall domed ceiling and then the side that has the doors into everybody\\u2019s bedrooms. It feels like a square. There are at least two bedrooms on each side, so that makes it an eight bedroom house upstairs. It feels really, really big and I think it\\u2019s even bigger than that. There\\u2019s more than one bathroom. The fact that I have my own ensuite, my bedroom is also really big. This is my dream setting. I am in my bedroom and I\\u2019m aware that my daughter and her boyfriend have gone into my own ensuite bathroom because I can hear their voices. It sounds like one of them is in the shower and the other is just doing something in the bathroom. So they\\u2019re having a conversation. I realize it\\u2019s my daughter in the shower. She\\u2019s getting ready to go to work and her boyfriend is going to drive her. He\\u2019s doing most of the talking. I can hear sounds of her getting ready. As I look towards the bathroom, I see that there\\u2019s beading on the wall that my bedroom shares with the ensuite - the door to which is closed, obviously. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh no, the shower water is leaking through the walls somehow.\\u201d Then I go around where the beading is. The part of the wall where the ensuite is is curved inwards towards my room. So I go around to the other side of the curve and I notice that the beading is getting more prolific and it\\u2019s brown, like tobacco color. Then my eyes follow up from the beading to the ceiling, and I see that the ceiling is buckled down a little bit. It\\u2019s a really high ceiling - probably about 12 feet high. I follow that all the way across the ceiling with my eyes towards the window. I can tell there are a whole bunch of watermarks, so this must have been going on for a really long time. Then when I look back to the curved part of my own wall, I can see that the beading has all turned black and it\\u2019s black mold. Then I turn back and look at the window. I see that that trajectory of water is also starting to turn into that tobacco color. Then I turn my head again and look back towards the shared wall of the bathroom and the material that the wall is made out of is starting to fall off the wall and around onto that one side to the left, there is a giant piece that has fallen off. I can see the shower curtain. It\\u2019s an old fashioned ball and claw bathtub with a track along the ceiling and the shower curtain. My daughter is like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that doing open when I\\u2019m having a shower?!\\u201d She\\u2019s shocked. Then both of them - she and her boyfriend - leave out the other door of the ensuite and enter my bedroom. She\\u2019s wrapped in a towel and asking what\\u2019s going on. I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. The bathroom is falling apart. The mold is eating it.\\u201d Then we\\u2019re trying to figure out who to call and I realize I don\\u2019t know who owns the house. Then I have this book that\\u2019s a registry of ownership. I\\u2019m going backwards in a reverse chronology through time of who owned the house. I realize that all these people are dead. I communicate this to them and tell them I still haven\\u2019t figured out who to call. Now she\\u2019s dressed and getting ready to leave for work, but as I look up to the ceiling, some of the ceiling is starting to fall down. I\\u2019m telling them to go get buckets to put underneath the parts where most of the water seems to be channeling to and dripping. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWho do I know that can come and help fix this? Who do I know that also has a house around this age that might have some wisdom?\\u201d I think of someone with last name Landon, who used to be the landlord of a house I lived in a long time ago. I find his phone number and call him. He arrives at the front door and one of the kids lets him in. He comes upstairs. He\\u2019s got a ladder and we put it in the room and climb up the ladder. As soon as I touch the ceiling, the whole thing buckles and comes down. I realize it\\u2019s a ceiling underneath a ceiling. Above the ceiling is an attic. There\\u2019s a secret staircase on the other side that I didn\\u2019t know was above me. The ceiling that I thought was my bedroom ceiling has crumbled and my room is completely unusable - it\\u2019s disintegrated. I\\u2019m climbing up the ladder trying to access the little staircase that has been exposed. Somehow I manage to do it. I reach for the bottom stair of the new staircase and climb up those creaky wooden stairs. There\\u2019s a wooden door at the top. I turn the doorknob and enter. It\\u2019s a really long attic. You can smell that musty sawdusty wood smell. But it smells dry - it\\u2019s not moist like the moldy smell of what has disintegrated below me. Then I see Omar. He\\u2019s sitting in there. He doesn\\u2019t say anything, though. I\\u2019m looking around the attic trying to locate or hunt for or unearth any signs of who has lived here before. I\\u2019m wondering why it was deliberately covered up. Unfortunately at this point, a noise in the real world wakes me up. I want to return to this dream.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Board Meeting\\u201d In this dream, I am in a townhouse complex. It opens and I\\u2019m having a day to myself where I realize I can do whatever I want. I\\u2019ve decided I\\u2019m just going to play my guitar. I get my guitar out and am setting it up. I see out my window that my stepmother is leaving. Through the window, although I can\\u2019t hear her voice, she tells me that she\\u2019s told the board of directors that I\\u2019m going to take her place for the day and be the secretary and record her notes. I\\u2019m annoyed and then she\\u2019s gone. I don\\u2019t even have time to tell her this is my only day to myself and I didn\\u2019t even agree to this. Now instead of having the day, the board of directors is filing into my house. I notice that they\\u2019re the seniors from the day at the whaling place when they were just there as onlookers at this whaling equipment and remarking over it. This also annoys me. The meeting starts and they\\u2019re talking about things. As I\\u2019m recording this, I\\u2019m noticing that no one is really sharing the conversation. No decision is being made. They\\u2019re just talking about everything. They move from one thing to another and it\\u2019s taking an extraordinary long period of time and it\\u2019s unproductive. I start doodling on my page and not really recording anything. Then they get to a conversation where someone has brought up that they smell marijuana in the complex. I think to myself, \\u201cWell, of course you do. It\\u2019s legal in Canada now.\\u201dThey\\u2019re talking about the smell. They don\\u2019t like walking through smells. I think to myself, \\u201cyeah, I\\u2019ve smelled it for about half a second when I\\u2019ve been in a canoe on the water and no one else is around. I\\u2019ve smelled it for another half a second when I\\u2019m walking on a sidewalk to the grocery store.\\u201d So the clouds of smoke from somebody\\u2019s house half a mile away have drifted around like other smells do from the kitchen and people\\u2019s bathrooms. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow much longer are they going to go on talking about the smell and they can\\u2019t even do anything about it. This meeting is unproductive.\\u201d So I set down the pad of paper I\\u2019m writing on and I wander off to a different area of the room. I actually get my guitar out again and wonder if they can hear me. I start tuning it very quietly and no one says anything. Then I start playing a song. Then I hear on the agenda that they\\u2019re talking about someone who has asked for a refund of $26.57 for something the board processed that they shouldn\\u2019t have. I think, \\u201cOh, that was me! That was years and years ago. I\\u2019d forgotten about that.\\u201d So I set my guitar down and go back to the table. I\\u2019m listening to the process of their conversation and wondering if they just talk about this at every meeting for three years and never get it off their list? I wonder if they\\u2019re going to get it off their list this time. I don\\u2019t even care about it now and it\\u2019s a small amount. I\\u2019d forgotten about what it was for and as I\\u2019m listening to the conversation, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh yeah, they shouldn\\u2019t have charged me for that. So one of the men that was on the whaling excursion, he's sayinsaucerg that she\\u2019s right and they should reimburse her the money. He doesn\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s me. Someone else from the board says, \\u201cWell, where will the money come from?\\u201d I mentally roll my eyes and think, \\u201cGeez, they don\\u2019t even have a treasurer.\\u201d Then someone else says, \\u201cWe need to put in a request for that.\\u201d Then I just wander away from the table again, thinking, \\u201cWow, they will never get anything done. Maybe they\\u2019re just here because there\\u2019s nothing else for them to do.\\u201d I go back to my guitar.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bubble Gum Pipe\\u201d I\\u2019m in a room and people I used to work with at a restaurant while at university are gathered in this room. They\\u2019re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They\\u2019re there, too. At first I don\\u2019t notice them because they\\u2019re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we\\u2019re in this other place. They have a baby. I\\u2019m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we\\u2019re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I\\u2019m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I\\u2019m watching the skaters. I\\u2019m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She\\u2019s got a platter in her hands. It\\u2019s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She\\u2019s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It\\u2019s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she\\u2019s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I\\u2019m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don\\u2019t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don\\u2019t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: \\u201cFreya, get over here. I\\u2019ve got one for you.\\u201d So I start to walk closer to her. But I\\u2019m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it\\u2019s warm and there\\u2019s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI heat it up with taffy first.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don\\u2019t want it in my mouth. She says, \\u201cCome on. You\\u2019re coming with us.\\u201d I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, \\u201cMy dad, I need to let him know where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d She says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. He\\u2019ll be okay for a bit.\\u201d I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go see my mom and dad.\\u201d We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We\\u2019re almost at her parents\\u2019 place. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He\\u2019s going to be worried about me.\\u201d I look down and say, \\u201cOh we don\\u2019t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can\\u2019t even call him.\\u201d She says to me, \\u201cYour dad was crying when I saw him. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d Then I get more distraught. She says, \\u201cHe knows where my parents live. He\\u2019ll know where to come get you.\\u201d I think that he won\\u2019t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, \\u201cHow did we get all the way over here?!\\u201d Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman\\u2019s house. I think, \\u201cHow is this truck even making it down the side because it\\u2019s so steep?\\u201d It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I\\u2019m not going to get to my dad in time. He\\u2019s going to be gone by the time I get there because this is taking so very long. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Bus Trip\\u201d I\\u2019m on a tour bus, a coach bus that they charter for tours across the country. I\\u2019m with Natalie, one of the owners of the Yoga Studio where I work and two little girls, maybe about ages four and six, somewhere in there. The kids are a lot younger so I\\u2019m assuming that they're two of her four kids, but maybe not. The bus stops and we all get out. There\\u2019s a baseball game going on in a field. The baseball diamond is at the back of a building. I\\u2019m not sure what\\u2019s going on in the building. It\\u2019s almost like a school meet and greet, it has that kind of feel to it. Natalie and the two girls go off and join up with the meet and greet. I\\u2019m more interested in the baseball. Because I\\u2019m not a regular player, they put me in the outfield, which is fine. I\\u2019m standing there, the way you would in the outfield, waiting for something to happen out there. I start to listen to the dialogue between the other outfielders. I notice that they\\u2019re mocking a woman. The mockery is to do with women is like, \\u201cYeah right, they\\u2019re not good for baseball that\\u2019s for sure.\\u201d Then the men all laugh. I suddenly think, \\u201cAre they talking about me?\\u201d I notice that there are about ten outfielders and one or two other women while the others are men. At first I\\u2019m offended by this. I feel a little bit of umbrage start to rise up because I\\u2019m actually really good at baseball. They don't know this. I notice that although they\\u2019re mocking, they\\u2019re also smiling as though they also appreciate the fact that the women have some skills. It\\u2019s a strange mix of regard and disregard. As I\\u2019m noticing this, I'm also noticing their clothing. It looks like the kind of clothing that men in the fifties would wear. I suddenly notice they all have fifties style clothing with the vest overtop of the short sleeved shirt. I realize as I look at the women's clothing and the umpire wearing this heavy leather vest instead of the sleek light-weight material it\\u2019s made of now that it is the fifties. This is how me in the fifties probably talked about women as co-ed games just began to rise in acceptability. I\\u2019m gladI restrained myself and didn\\u2019t say anything because I don\\u2019t want to stand out and show that I\\u2019m from a different time period. The baseball game ensues. I do catch a couple baseballs and throw them to the appropriate pitch. I get a couple of hands across the back, guy\\u2019s style way to go slaps. The baseball game ends. I see Natalie and the two girls walking across the field towards me and we get back on the bus. The next stop is a big long building that\\u2019s a flea market. The tour guide stands up and says, \\u201cOkay, you\\u2019ve got enough time for five cubbies or booths and two something elses.\\u201d So we get off the bus and we know we have to hurry because there are only a hundred and we can only pick five and then two. We have to make sure it\\u2019s the ones we want. I don\\u2019t really care about anything that\\u2019s there. I let Natalie do the selection and I think that will keep the girls occupied because they\\u2019re starting to get a little bit restless. One of the ones we go into is a freestyle jumping area with skipping ropes and things to climb through. They are made of a different material and there are no electronics. I\\u2019m wondering what time period this is from. One of the others is a playhouse. It\\u2019s so sexist. The girls are playing and they\\u2019re sweeping and pretending to wash dishes. I\\u2019m quickly losing interest in this and looking around to see what else I might be interested in. I go over to ask Natalie what time it is on her phone. We both have cell phones, but nobody else has this kind of equipment. The girls are already finished. We have a little extra time that we\\u2019re starting to bank. The next thing we see is a big long room with racks and racks of clothing. Interestingly, they\\u2019re sorted into colors and not sizes. I\\u2019m really liking this. Natalie says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s bring the girls through here because it\\u2019s so vast that just walking through will burn off some of their energy. I say, \\u201cGreat because there\\u2019s some stuff I\\u2019d like to look at here.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that if I can look closely enough at the clothing, I can figure out what decade this is. But what happens is that the girls run through and we\\u2019re burning through it and we\\u2019ll be done ahead of time and I\\u2019m not getting time to look at the clothes. I tell her that I want to go back and look at two different colors of clothing, although there's actually three when I think about it. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you back at the door when it\\u2019s time for us to get back on the bus.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s only five minutes from now.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019ll work quickly.\\u201d I go back and I\\u2019m looking through the brown clothing. I think this is from the sixties. I\\u2019m picturing myself wearing this brown dress with the waist line just under the breasts and the full flowy skirt. I think I can do my eye makeup like the sixties and put my hair back like the sixties. I really want this dress. But there are only two sizes and one is obviously too small and there\\u2019s no way my boobs will fit in it, and the other one is giant. I\\u2019m disappointed because I really wanted one. I go over to the indigo rack. I don\\u2019t like anything I see there, it\\u2019s all ugly. There\\u2019s another rack of really light peach and a cashmere shirt with no sleeves and a little tiny soft loose turtleneck. I really want this shirt - it would be so soft and I could wear the peach color on my lips and still wear my hair and eye makeup in the sixties style. But there\\u2019s not enough time for me to buy it! I run back to the door and Natalie is standing there with the two kids. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cThe bus driver is looking for you!\\u201d I get on the bus and am disappointed and thinking about that shirt and then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cake\\u201d I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover\\u2019s apartment. I tell him that sure, I\\u2019ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn\\u2019t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it\\u2019s run by a temperamental chef. There\\u2019s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I\\u2019m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they\\u2019re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they\\u2019re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they\\u2019re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I\\u2019m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I\\u2019m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there\\u2019s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there\\u2019s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover\\u2019s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She\\u2019s about 10. And she\\u2019s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn\\u2019t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she\\u2019s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn\\u2019t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn\\u2019t upset about it. He\\u2019s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he\\u2019s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn\\u2019t address the cake. Now we\\u2019re in a car and we\\u2019re driving up this beautiful roadway - it\\u2019s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there\\u2019s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don\\u2019t want to make a mistake in when you\\u2019re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It\\u2019s a perfect day and there\\u2019s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it\\u2019s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cash\\u201d I\\u2019m in a town and I\\u2019m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They\\u2019re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I\\u2019m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it\\u2019s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there\\u2019s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they\\u2019re not making any sound, so I\\u2019m suspecting that it\\u2019s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don\\u2019t have that much money yet. I\\u2019m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don\\u2019t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I\\u2019m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I\\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table. They\\u2019ve wandered off now and I\\u2019m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I\\u2019m sensing another presence there that I can\\u2019t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what\\u2019s wrong with my car. He\\u2019s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic\\u2019s and I tell them exactly what\\u2019s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don\\u2019t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I\\u2019ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, \\u201cYay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.\\u201d And they\\u2019re saying, \\u201cOh wow, that\\u2019s fantastic.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn\\u2019t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.\\u201d So I\\u2019m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I\\u2019m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar\\u2019s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he\\u2019s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I\\u2019ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, \\u201cOh, what was wrong with it?\\u201d And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I\\u2019m cautious as Mike asks me what\\u2019s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, \\u201cOh? How did you know to say that?\\u201d because he knows even though I\\u2019m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don\\u2019t know the exact language to call the parts. And he\\u2019s looking at me. And I\\u2019m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I\\u2019m thinking is that I don\\u2019t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he\\u2019s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we\\u2019re in shifts and changes and we\\u2019re sitting in his mom\\u2019s actual house on the couch in the living room. There\\u2019s a picture of Omar on the end table. I\\u2019ve got my one arm around the back of Mike\\u2019s shoulders soothing him. I\\u2019m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, \\u201cOmar told you, didn\\u2019t he?\\u201d and I said, \\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d And then I say to him: \\u201care you okay?\\u201d And he puts his head down and it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom\\u2019s house are gone. We\\u2019re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we\\u2019re in it. Omar\\u2019s at the wheel and he\\u2019s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He\\u2019s tapping the gas pedal and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201chmm well this is good.\\u201d I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, \\u201cyeah and look how much cash I\\u2019ve got left over.\\u201d He laughs. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that extra cash?\\u201d And I know what I\\u2019m going to do with it, but I haven\\u2019t told anyone. So we\\u2019re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it\\u2019s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we\\u2019re driving down Colburn for a block and now it\\u2019s the year it would be now. I\\u2019m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s an ice cream store over there. That\\u2019s new. There\\u2019s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there\\u2019s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn\\u2019t changed.\\u201d Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing? Now we\\u2019re back on Kent St.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.\\u201d He looks at me and we\\u2019re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I\\u2019ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, \\u201cWhat are we doing here?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I\\u2019ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.\\u201d I give it to him and I say, \\u201cGo buy a guitar. Just do it!\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d So we go into the store and we\\u2019re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, \\u201cOh what one are you interested in?\\u201d Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, \\u201cWell, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn\\u2019t have the pickup and it\\u2019s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.\\u201d So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.\\u201d (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, \\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cYes!\\u201d And he says, \\u201cDone!\\u201d So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they\\u2019re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that\\u2019s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there\\u2019s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There\\u2019s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There\\u2019s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it\\u2019s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he\\u2019s doing. It looks like he\\u2019s making chocolate chip cookies. He\\u2019s got the dough rolled out and there\\u2019s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, \\u201cWhat the hell?!\\u201d I walk up and I\\u2019m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they\\u2019re not even chocolate chips. They\\u2019re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I\\u2019m thinking, oh my god, that\\u2019s gross, but I\\u2019m fascinated that he\\u2019s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: \\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\\u201d and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they\\u2019ve already gone out of that room and I know they\\u2019re going down a hall and there\\u2019s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There\\u2019s no tools in front of him and no table. He\\u2019s faking working. I realize that he\\u2019s eavesdropping, he\\u2019s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my dream?! You\\u2019ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.\\u201d He starts telling me that he\\u2019s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It\\u2019s bullshit what he\\u2019s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don\\u2019t want to lose them and I certainly don\\u2019t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it\\u2019s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He\\u2019s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like \\u201cWho\\u2019s that?\\u201d Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, \\u201cThis is Errant, my ex-husband.\\u201d And I say, \\u201cThis is Omar.\\u201d As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar\\u2019s hand, I realize that there\\u2019s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant\\u2019s going to be mad about this and he\\u2019s going to pound it out into me because he\\u2019s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I\\u2019m like I can\\u2019t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don\\u2019t want that handshake to join. Errant says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad,\\u201d as though he knows Omar\\u2019s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, \\u201cFor fucks sake! He knows that and he\\u2019s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He\\u2019s inserting himself here and of course, Omar\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh thanks very much.\\u201d He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, \\u201cOh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.\\u201d I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I\\u2019m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there\\u2019s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I\\u2019m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he\\u2019s a jerk, don\\u2019t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I\\u2019m still so agitated I can\\u2019t calm myself down in the dream. I\\u2019m feeling both threatened that Errant\\u2019s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I\\u2019m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I\\u2019m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won\\u2019t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I\\u2019m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Coffee Pot\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It\\u2019s snowing out. There\\u2019s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it\\u2019s still snowing. There\\u2019s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there\\u2019s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don\\u2019t. The house is brick. It\\u2019s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it\\u2019s taller than it is wide. It\\u2019s old. I can tell it\\u2019s old because the glass isn\\u2019t flattened by a machine, it\\u2019s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I\\u2019m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It\\u2019s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say \\u2018it likes\\u201d because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It\\u2019s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it\\u2019s mostly black. It looks like it\\u2019s made of cast iron but it\\u2019s not because it\\u2019s light when you pick it up. I think it\\u2019s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It\\u2019s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There\\u2019s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It\\u2019s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I\\u2019ll sometimes look for it. I\\u2019ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it\\u2019s going to disappear and come back again. This day it\\u2019s missing. I have a roommate. She\\u2019s more like a neighbor but she\\u2019s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I\\u2019m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I\\u2019ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I\\u2019m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, \\u201cHave you seen the coffee pot?\\u201d She continues to look at me but doesn\\u2019t nod her head yes or no. I say, \\u201cJust in case you\\u2019re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you\\u2019re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?\\u201d She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I\\u2019m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It\\u2019s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it\\u2019s happy. When it\\u2019s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it\\u2019s been. It\\u2019s like every time it comes back it\\u2019s a little bit different. Sometimes it\\u2019s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It\\u2019s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it\\u2019s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Cold Water\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large ranch style log house. There is a lot of iron made stuff and stuff made out of wood. There are really old fashioned cooking implements nailed to the wall. There are farming pieces and sides all made of iron and hand-hammered - you can see the little pound marks and everything. It stretches from the eating area through what would be the kitchen area into a longer gathering place where there are other rooms that are dark - I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s in them but I think they are bedrooms. I\\u2019m standing in that area. I\\u2019ve walked in through the front door, through the parlor, through the kitchen area, and now I\\u2019m standing in the back parlor. Other people are there and in my dream I know them but I don\\u2019t recognize them with my conscious mind to give them a name now. They\\u2019re dressing in various kinds of wetsuits. They have diving equipment and masks. Some of the wetsuits are the short ones, some are longer in the leg. The idea is to go out snorkeling or diving into the stream that runs on the property behind the ranch house. I feel like I\\u2019m ready to go and I\\u2019m confident. So, I walk out and it\\u2019s winter. There\\u2019s snow on the ground. I walk out the door along the snow, along the bank of the river, until I get to the point where it\\u2019s been decided that I will enter. Everyone is entering at a different place. I start to climb down a river bank that\\u2019s probably about four feet high. I\\u2019m backing down on my stomach. Where my feet are supposed to hit solid ground, they don\\u2019t. It breaks from underneath the weight of my body, but there\\u2019s so much of my body already over the embankment that I can\\u2019t pull myself back up and I just slip down into the freezing icy cold water. I\\u2019m trying to shout for help. I can feel my limbs starting to freeze. But nothing comes out of my throat. I keep trying to shout louder but my voice won\\u2019t obey my emotion. I\\u2019m trying to say help and I\\u2019m trying to say I\\u2019m cold, but nothing comes out. I can see people around me but they aren\\u2019t noticing that I\\u2019ve broken through the surface and I\\u2019m sinking.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Creek\\u201d I\\u2019m in a forest and it\\u2019s winter. There are various people out in the forest as opposed to being in the squat stone building that maybe people live in. it has the atmosphere of danger and some kind of threat. I feel like people have been fighting recently. There\\u2019s a woman and she has sleepy eyes and a drink in her hand. I think she\\u2019s drunk. She\\u2019s wearing a long cloak and has some small beads that she\\u2019s wearing on her forehead. She\\u2019s older. There are bodies lying around, too, I can see them. They\\u2019re knights and their armor has been smashed and dented. I\\u2019m also wearing a long gown covered with a cloak. I don\\u2019t feel cold, but I know I would be if I weren\\u2019t wearing so many clothes. I\\u2019m waiting for people and we\\u2019re supposed to be leaving to go somewhere. I see one of the people I\\u2019ve been waiting for, a younger woman and she\\u2019s garbed the same way we are. I can see through the evening a low stone building. It looks like there is a big stone wall around the building. It\\u2019s like a low big building with a defense wall around it. We\\u2019re waiting for one more person before we take off. We have to go across the creek and through the other side because it will be safer that way. The creek is frozen over. As I\\u2019m standing there, I\\u2019m watching an animal go across. I can\\u2019t quite see what kind of animal because it\\u2019s dark and I\\u2019m trying to figure out what they are. On the other side, I see a bigger roundish black animal and a very small one that\\u2019s maybe the size of a dog or a cat. As my eyes start to focus in on them and get used to the dark, I realize the small one is a baby bear. The woman beside me says out loud or telepathically that she has to go get that bear because it\\u2019s her spirit animal. So she starts to slide down the bank, taking small steps and sliding on her bum a bit. Everyone is quite respectful and nervous of the creek because we don\\u2019t know if we can break through or not. But she wants to get the baby bear because it\\u2019s part of the journey. The other animal is not the mama bear; I think it\\u2019s a teenage bear. The baby is struggling. Its legs are too short to navigate the land. The younger woman starts across the creek. She asks, \\u201cWhere did it go? I don\\u2019t see where it went.\\u201d I\\u2019m scanning the area with my eyes. I see another body, also female, at the side of the bank. She looks dead. The little bear has stumbled across towards her over the snow banks and frozen water that was heaved up over to the side. It looks like it\\u2019s trying to rouse her, licking her face and pawing at her. She doesn\\u2019t stir and I really think she\\u2019s dead. As the other woman stands up and walks across the creek, she\\u2019s about half way across and I see close to the shore I\\u2019m standing on, a hand reaching up from the ice. The hand has long thin fingers and reminds me of a sloth\\u2019s hands. I know it\\u2019s not human. It looks familiar but I don't quite know what it is. The baby bear stops trying to rouse the dead woman and has begun making its way towards the younger woman that was going to get it. It\\u2019s moving the way a puppy wags its whole body in happiness about being picked up or given attention. She does get the bear and pick it up. Now we have everything. There\\u2019s a woman behind me - the woman that looks drunk -, me and the one that has the small bear. We start to make our way across the creek. Then the dream blips out. We\\u2019ve made it across and there is less snow so the walking is easier. We\\u2019re going away from the small castle with the defense wall around it. We\\u2019re moving through the forest.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Curio Shop\\u201d My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I\\u2019m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It\\u2019s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can\\u2019t even see what\\u2019s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don\\u2019t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We\\u2019re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They\\u2019re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we\\u2019ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It\\u2019s purple, but it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s blue. It\\u2019s got fur all over. The fur doesn\\u2019t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there\\u2019s this creature in the store and my son\\u2019s got him. I don\\u2019t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they\\u2019re half off, they\\u2019re still really expensive and I don\\u2019t think I need a spoon that badly. I don\\u2019t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I\\u2019m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s this one.\\u201d I still think it\\u2019s expensive and say I don\\u2019t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my son?\\u201d One of the male shopkeepers says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to follow me.\\u201d So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d and it just bursts out of my body. I\\u2019m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it\\u2019s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I\\u2019m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that\\u2019s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, \\u201cNo way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!\\u201d So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, \\u201cRun! We have to get out of here!\\u201d So we start running. I don\\u2019t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We\\u2019re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can\\u2019t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s go in there. There are other people.\\u201d The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, \\u201cLet\\u2019s change our clothes, \\u201c so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He\\u2019s right there. I tell him, \\u201cYour partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can\\u2019t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.\\u201d He\\u2019s not helpful. In fact, he\\u2019s in league with the other one. So now we\\u2019re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can\\u2019t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got my son! You\\u2019re holding him and I want him back.\\u201d Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, \\u201cFine fine, okay!\\u201d He writes this phone number down. I say, \\u201cA phone number?! Are you kidding me?!\\u201d I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I\\u2019ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I\\u2019m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It\\u2019s a 10-digit number. Now I\\u2019ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It\\u2019s like 164576476470, like that. The 4\\u2019s and 7\\u2019s won\\u2019t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I\\u2019m sobbing and saying, \\u201cJust tell me where he is. Just go get him.\\u201d One of them says he\\u2019s in the basement. \\u201cThe basement of this building?!\\u201d I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I\\u2019m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m trying to get back into the dream, but I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Disc, the Irish and the Owl\\u201d This dream I think I am in some kind of consciousness of one of my best friend\\u2019s from high school. I\\u2019ll call her Ellie. She died of cancer in her thirties in real life. The dream setting is I\\u2019m in outer space on a big round disc. It\\u2019s flat and shiny on one side and rough and rocky - the rocks are black with granules in them, like sand, that seem to be picking up a little bit of stellar light. There are lines on top of the disc that radiate out from the center towards the periphery. In the center are a few people. As I get closer to the disc, I\\u2019m standing on it in one of the radii. There\\u2019s my friend, Ellie. She takes me around the disc and I seem to gelan that there are twelve of these radii. Each one goes towards the periphery and there\\u2019s a door on the periphery. I go into some of the doors and see people. The first one I go in is a washroom. There\\u2019s various people in there and they\\u2019re trying to get something sticky off their hands. I feel a little confused as to why I\\u2019m in here - I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to discover or look for. So because it\\u2019s a washroom, I go into one of the stalls and decide to sit down on the toilet and see if I can urinate. I do. Then I take some toilet paper. It\\u2019s sticky! So, I wipe myself, but then it won\\u2019t immediately leave my fingers and go into the toilet. So I get another piece. I try to wash the first piece off my fingers, but it too is sticky. I rub my fingers together to try and get it off, put it into the toilet and it does. It disintegrates a little, but there are still pieces on my fingers. I dress and go to wash my hands. I notice that there\\u2019s little bits of shit all over everything. Now I don\\u2019t want to touch the taps because I think that will get on my fingers. I can start to smell it now and it\\u2019s disgusting. I just want to leave that area. I think there are little bits of shit on my leg and the back of my jeans and on my arms and clothing. Just little tiny pieces. I can\\u2019t find anywhere to wash that\\u2019s also not covered with shit. I come out of the bathroom and look at Ellie. Then I look down at myself and it\\u2019s all cleaned. So I wonder why she\\u2019s taking me through these experiences. She sends me down to what would be the 6 o\\u2019clock position. We had been standing at 12 and this washroom was about at 2 o\\u2019clock. There are people in some kind of friction, perhaps arguing. I don't get involved with that. Instead of going all the way around the clock, I come back up the same side I went down towards her. Without saying anything, I communicate to her that I\\u2019m really not enjoying this experience. She says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go back to my house for dinner.\\u201d She\\u2019s from a large Irish family with 6 kids. We appear in her house. A few of the kids have a friend, so there are a large number of people in the kitchen. There were four boys in that family, two of them were twins and then herself and her sister. The twin boys each have a friend over and there\\u2019s one extra friend. The older two boys are in the den watching tv. I look at the friends and think that they\\u2019ve been smoking. The mom puts the meat on a plate and puts it on the table. I think to myself that there\\u2019s not enough for the number of people that are there, but I\\u2019m not very hungry anyway. So I don\\u2019t take my plate and line up to get food. The boys and their friends do. They take almost all of it and there\\u2019s just Ellie, her sister and me and the two parents who haven\\u2019t eaten yet. They tell me to take my plate and go get some. So I take the saucer from underneath the tea cup, so it\\u2019s a very small plate and I just put a little bit of meat on it, a tiny bit of potato and some gravy. Then I turn around and there\\u2019s this whole other plate of meat. So I say, \\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t see that.\\u201d They say, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s okay, here, take another piece.\\u201d Somebody puts another forkful on my plate. So we eat. Then the boys and their friends go back outside for a little while to run off some of their energy. I go into the sisters\\u2019 room and see that it used to be the pantry because there\\u2019s not very much room to walk around the bunk bed. Somehow or other, Ellie\\u2019s sister has managed to sit in this little tiny space and she\\u2019s playing with some plastic toys that are lined up on the floor. She seems to be happy. I go back out. Now I feel like I have somehow become Ellie because she is gone and I\\u2019m just there and her family is treating me as though I am her. I go out into the kitchen, clean up the rest of the dishes. Then I check on the boys - I go into the den. The mama is in there as well and someone comes to the door and she knocks on it and asks the mom for some help. The mom lets her in and offers her some food. The woman accepts the offer, takes some and asks the mom if she will take out her stitches. So the mom gets some first aid things, gets her food, takes out her stitches, wraps the food up for her, sends her away out the door. As the woman is leaving, she says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you again in the morning.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow this family gives so much to other people.\\u201d Then I leave the den, go back out into the kitchen and the boys come home. I look at them and their eyes are red. I think they\\u2019ve been smoking and I wonder why no one else seems to comment on them. But one of the twins looks guilty and puts his head down and doesn\\u2019t meet his mother\\u2019s eyes when he walks by her. Now it\\u2019s nighttime. Everybody is getting ready for bed. The whole family is home. I go into my room. I see an owl. It\\u2019s looking in the window at me. I realize it\\u2019s a pink owl - that\\u2019s the name of the species. I like a cigarette and smoke it. So, now I\\u2019m confused. I realize that Ellie smoked in high school, so I must be her. I lie in bed, watching into the night and I see the owl fly off towards some celestial body in the sky. Then it becomes morning. I haven\\u2019t slept. I just stayed in my bed. I only had one cigarette, but the room is smoky. I get up in the morning and instantly the bedroom changes into an eating area again. There\\u2019s all kinds of extra people in it - everybody has an extra friend. There are extra adults who have come with the parents and there\\u2019s food on the table. The meal is shared around again and it seems to keep growing from the plate. Even though it doesn\\u2019t look like there\\u2019s enough food to satisfy everyone, there seems to be enough. Then the food is cleared away and the dishes are brought into the kitchen to be washed. When I\\u2019m out in the kitchen, the final scene I notice is one girl that was very nasty. Her name was Lynn. She\\u2019s also sitting in the middle of the kitchen. I remember she was a person who tried to insert herself into the friendship that I had with Ellie, but it didn\\u2019t really work. There were no ties or anything in common. She\\u2019s sitting there and no one is talking to her. I just walk by her, noticing her presence, but don\\u2019t speak with her. She is not nice. I don\\u2019t look at her and don\\u2019t want to interact. I continue washing dishes and then wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Domo\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to teach my class and there\\u2019s so much noise that I can\\u2019t even hear the sound of my own voice. I\\u2019m not sure what building I\\u2019m in, it\\u2019s got a sloped ceiling but the ceiling is also really high and there\\u2019s a little bit of slope to the floor. It\\u2019s almost like a lecture theatre, except there are no chairs. It\\u2019s supposed to have really good acoustics but it doesn\\u2019t because there\\u2019s so much background noise, but it\\u2019s not the students in the class that are talking, it\\u2019s students in the hallway and crowds of people outside. I can hear construction, jack hammers and buzz saws. It\\u2019s a cacophony of sound and so loud that I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m speaking or not. I can\\u2019t start my class. I go to the hallway, open the doorway and ask the people out there waiting to go into another class if they could please be quiet because they\\u2019re so loud. As I\\u2019m saying this, I realize there\\u2019s not supposed to be any talking in the building. So they say they will be quiet. I go back into my class. As soon as I start teaching, I can hear them again. They\\u2019re playing sports in the hallway, yelling and cheering. I can\\u2019t start. Then I\\u2019m sitting off to the side, I still have to sit there for the full hour, but I\\u2019m not teaching because I can\\u2019t. I see my brother. He\\u2019s not in the class, but he\\u2019s wandered up from the construction sight where people are building something. He\\u2019s taking a break. We talk for a few minutes. I feel really good to see him in my heart, I feel comforted by his presence. Then, it\\u2019s quieter. It stays quiet. I say I\\u2019m going to start trying to teach my class again. I ask him: \\u201cWill you stay?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t practice yoga, but he says, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll try it this time.\\u201d There he is. I move my mat from the middle of the class up to the front as though I\\u2019m a participant. This way I can be beside my brother. My voice, because of the design of the acoustics, it doesn\\u2019t matter that I\\u2019m not facing my class because the voice is supposed to carry anyways. So I start teaching and it\\u2019s so nice and quiet. I get through the sun salutations and a few other postures, then all the horrible noises start again. I try to teach a little bit more but I can\\u2019t hear my own voice. I do a few more things just continuing on, hoping the class can see me and just follow along. This works for about five minutes, then the whole cohesiveness disintegrates so I stop. By this time the hour I was supposed to be in there was over and I\\u2019m free to go. I ask my brother, \\u201cEven though it was only a part class, what do you think? You looked like you were doing everything just fine.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYeah, you know it is a good class. But I\\u2019m not going to start doing it every day.\\u201d I laugh because I know he wouldn\\u2019t do that anyway. He goes back to the construction area and I go out the opposite door of where the students are going into the noisy hallway. I exit out of the building but it\\u2019s not really a hallway, everything turns into glass. There\\u2019s a glass vestibule and a door to the outside which is a docked area with a walkway and piers but I don\\u2019t see any ships. It\\u2019s good to be out in the sunlight and air. I see the husband and two kids of the two studio owners I work for. I walk towards them. I\\u2019m supposed to meet them because we\\u2019re all waiting for her. While we\\u2019re waiting, one of her kids is squatting down on the dock and looking into a hole in it. I\\u2019m curious at what they\\u2019re doing, they\\u2019re trying to pull out a bug. I walk over closer and actually see that he\\u2019s pulled out one already and it\\u2019s just sitting there. I wonder what kind of bug it is. I squat down closer to see and I\\u2019m just watching, I haven\\u2019t said anything to him. He has some kind of tweezers and is trying to pull out another bug and he\\u2019s working away at it for a few minutes. Then he says to me, \\u201cCan you see it down there?\\u201d I get a flashlight out from the back of my cell phone and am shining it around in the hole. I can see something but I don\\u2019t know what it is. Then he says to me, \\u201cHere,\\u201d and he hands me the tweezers. \\u201cCan you try?\\u201d So I get down a little closer on my belly. I can see something down there now. I want to be careful I don\\u2019t injure it. I put the tweezers around it gently and start to pull a little bit. Then I take it out. I have it just behind it\\u2019s skull, around its neck. I set it on the dock. It\\u2019s just sitting there, kind of like it\\u2019s stunned, probably because of the light. It was quite dark down in the hole. It\\u2019s got a very very very dark green body and a gold head. It has a band of gold at the top of its tail and the rest of its tail is green, a greenish black. I say, \\u201cOh what is this?\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t have scales, it has the body of a beetle, but without the hard shell on the top so it\\u2019s soft. It\\u2019s tail is reptilian. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a domo.\\u201d I say, \\u201dHmm, I\\u2019ve never heard of that.\\u201d We look at it a little bit more. It has really beautiful black eyes and it looks like there\\u2019s a soul in them. Probably it\\u2019s three inches long. I say, \\u201cOkay?\\u201d He says yes. Then I put it back in the hole. The other things that he\\u2019s pulled out look like dead bugs, probably that the domo has fed from. I just use the side of my hand to brush them back into the hole. I give the son back his tweezers. We stand up. The daughter says something to me but I can\\u2019t recall now what it was. We move off to the side away from the dock. We\\u2019re still waiting for their mom to come. We sit. I don\\u2019t know how we got inside the building but we are. We\\u2019re in a different part of the building. The kids are playing together and I\\u2019m sitting down. The husband comes over and starts talking to me about something. Then he says, \\u201cJust a sec, close your eyes.\\u201d As soon as I close my eyes, I feel this big particle start to fall on my eye and face. He blows on my face. I feel it move along my eyelashes. Then he says, \\u201cOh are you upset that I did that?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking it was a little bit weird having his breath so close to my face. I don't think he meant anything intimate by it. I think he was just having a dad reflex, like when you say hold still and blow to interrupt a thing that was going to fall in your kid\\u2019s eyes. I say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But then I look at the thing and it\\u2019s like a big giant salt crystal, probably a quarter inch by quarter inch like a triangle cube. Now they\\u2019re falling all over the place. There\\u2019s a bed that\\u2019s not mine and somebody is supposed to be lying in it. These salt crystals are all over it. I look and there is a handheld vacuum off to the side. I say, \\u201cHey I\\u2019m going to use this and see if I can get these things off the bed before they fall all the way down to the bottom.\\u201d I turn the vacuum on and suck up these things. But there are so many of them that they are spilling out of the vacuum as quickly as they\\u2019re coming in. I dump these things out of the vacuum. I open the vacuum up, clean it all out, put the vacuum together and turn it on. I put my hand over the nozzle and feel that it has good suction. I go back to the bed and try to suck these into the vacuum. I pull the mattress away from the side of the bed so I can get in there. I do this a few times. Now I realize that I do need to sleep here. I don\\u2019t want to lie on these hard crystalline things. I\\u2019m trying to get them off the bed. I\\u2019m fiddling with this and trying to clean it. Then I see that the studio owner, the kids\\u2019 mom, is back. Something completes. I don\\u2019t have to wait anymore. I\\u2019ve done what I\\u2019m supposed to do and can check out now.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Ex\\u2019s Whiskey Bottles\\u201d I\\u2019m in an apartment. I\\u2019ve just moved there. I'm surrounded by all these things, almost three-quarters of them are my ex-husband\\u2019s. I don\\u2019t notice this until I\\u2019ve hired two people to come help me clean because I can\\u2019t get it all done. One woman makes a comment that she can\\u2019t clean around all this stuff. She asks me if I can move it. I apologize and say, \\u201cYeah, I\\u2019m trying to go through all this.\\u201d Then I ask her what stuff she\\u2019s talking about. I look at it and the stuff she\\u2019s talking about is gold whiskey decanters. They\\u2019re all different kinds and shapes and they\\u2019re valuable and they\\u2019re all empty. People have given them to us. I never filled them because I don\\u2019t drink whiskey. I didn't throw them away because they were gifts. Some of them I haven\\u2019t even looked in. So she\\u2019s indicating them. I pick them up. These ones are squares - six squares made of gold with rings on the top that you pull on and the decanter slides up out of the square gold carrying case. That\\u2019s when I notice they\\u2019re empty. Then I realize that he\\u2019s taken some of them, but only the ones that had whiskey in them. So I think, \\u201dWhat am I going to do with all these?\\u201d Then I open the door and in the hallway, some sales rep from a whiskey company has set up a display of different kinds of whiskey. I think, \\u201cHmmm, I wonder if I can just set all the decanters up there when they\\u2019re not looking and they'll just think it\\u2019s part of the display.\\u201d So, now I\\u2019m busy with that. I\\u2019m opening the door, peeking out into the hallway, and waiting for all the people to leave so I can do this.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Family\\u201d In my dream I am always with this family - it\\u2019s a large family, there\\u2019s like 7 kids in it. I\\u2019m always over at their house, although I\\u2019m not a biological part of their family, but I\\u2019m there because I just love them and they don\\u2019t just tolerate me, they make me feel like part of their family. I\\u2019m not adopted. I do at times go home, but in my dream I don\\u2019t see anything of my own home, I just know that I do go there sometimes. The dream starts where we\\u2019re doing various different activities. There are some scenes where I\\u2019m in the downstairs bedroom which has three single beds in it and most of the kids seem to go down there to hang out. So some of the older boys are having their own conversation in one part of the room and I\\u2019m talking with the four youngest ones. One of them is my age, the other one is only a couple years younger and there\\u2019s another one about two years younger and an even younger one. So we just hang out, play games, talk. Sometimes the scene changes and we\\u2019re outside and we\\u2019re doing outdoor things or down by the lake - beachball, swimming, splashing around, stuff like that. It\\u2019s like the dream is establishing a long line of family activities. There\\u2019s even some that\\u2019s just meal time. And movies. So, this goes on until one day I\\u2019m again sitting in the downstairs bedroom that has the three beds in it, and one of the youngest two boys is now between the ages of 12-14 - it\\u2019s not specific in the dream, he\\u2019s not a boy but he\\u2019s not a man, so he\\u2019s a younger teenager. All of a sudden, he throws me on the bed, hikes my skirts up over my head and puts his mouth right on my clitoris, and then starts massaging it with his tongue. I\\u2019m in shock. I don\\u2019t react for maybe two seconds. And then I\\u2019m like: \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d At the same time that he does this, one of the other kids stands in front of the bed and opens up a giant sweater that becomes like a billboard, so the older kids don\\u2019t see this. I realize at the same time that this happened, this other sibling knew about it ahead of time and was helping. Anyway, that happens at the same time that I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d And I\\u2019m saying \\u201cStop it!\\u201d and he does. And then he goes into the bathroom which was a room - it\\u2019s like an ensuite large bedroom type of thing. There are so many kids in that family that they share a bathroom in the basement, another one on the main floor and another one on the top floor. I\\u2019m just sitting on the edge of the bed, and I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat the fuck? I didn\\u2019t see that coming.\\u201d And then I realize, oh maybe I did see it coming, I was just oblivious, because he\\u2019s always hanging around with us - my friend and I. Maybe he had a crush on me. Now I\\u2019m starting to feel like I\\u2019m partially responsible for that happening. So I start to feel bad. I start to feel guilty. So after a few minutes pass and I collect myself, and no one else noticed (the billboard sweater blocked the other three), so there\\u2019s still a fair amount of activity still going on in the room that was still going on when it happened and was still going on before that. So in a way, it kind of allows me to calm down because nothing else has changed, although that for me has changed. I feel like unless I sort this out, I won\\u2019t be able to come to this house anymore with this family I\\u2019ve come to love so much and is part of my sanctuary. So I go in the bathroom thinking I\\u2019m going to find some kind of wounded boy, and I\\u2019m going to see if he\\u2019s okay and I\\u2019m thinking we\\u2019re gonna have to have a conversation about this. And he\\u2019s doing something else. One of the younger siblings is in there having a bath. And I\\u2019m like, okay, so I go over to the cabinet. I\\u2019m getting things out for the younger kid\\u2019s bath, like soap and a towel and washcloth and setting them on the edge of the bathtub. And I notice that there\\u2019s a jar of alcohol in there, and I\\u2019m like: \\u201cWhose is this?\\u201d And I find out that it\\u2019s that boy\\u2019s - the tweenager - that molested me. And the younger one in the bathtub has also been sipping away at it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere did you get this?\\u201d Well, they stole it from their parents. But it\\u2019s like in a mason jar, an empty mayonnaise jar that has been cleaned out with the lid on it and stuffed in there between stacks of washcloths and cotton balls and toothpaste and stuff. So nobody notices - I guess with a house full of seven kids you don\\u2019t keep track of everything. So I put the lid on it and say, \\u201cYou guys shouldn\\u2019t be having this.\\u201d And then I close the shower curtain so the younger kid is in there having a bath, and he\\u2019s not that young - he\\u2019s like 10. And I talk to the other one. But just as I\\u2019m about to talk to him, I realize oh my god, he knew exactly what he was doing. He\\u2019s done this before. And I never even thought of him as old enough to have been having sex. And what\\u2019s all going through my mind at the same time is this - there\\u2019s been times when he\\u2019s not been participating in stuff with the rest of the family. So instead of having a talk with him because I\\u2019m worried about him, I\\u2019m feeling guilty, I feel like I\\u2019ve also appeased him. So instead of having a talk from that angle, I\\u2019m like: \\u201cHave you had a girlfriend before?\\u201d And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cyeah I\\u2019ve had one for two years.\\u201d First it was so and so, and then it was somebody else. And he starts telling me that he thinks I\\u2019m amazing and he wants to go out with me. It\\u2019s not just a crush, the things he\\u2019s saying to me sounds like a mature man. It\\u2019s just that he looks a lot younger, and I never thought of him like that. And part of me realizes that because I\\u2019ve known him since he was young, I still treat him like a baby and think that he\\u2019s younger than he actually is. So in the dream, I realize that I\\u2019ve underestimated him but I\\u2019m still not comfortable because I\\u2019m enough older than he is that I don\\u2019t feel comfortable even though he\\u2019s technically old enough to have a relationship and has already had two. Then I tell him this: \\u201cLook I really care about you and think of you as a sibling. I\\u2019m not comfortable with this. I\\u2019m too old.\\u201d Then he seems okay with this, so I go upstairs because I don\\u2019t want to stay in the basement anymore. I still haven\\u2019t resolved my own feelings about feeling violated. And the scene shifts. So now one of the kids in the family that\\u2019s always a bit younger, I start to look at her, and I wonder about her features. I\\u2019ve always thought that she was a girl, but just not very feminine looking. And she always kept her hair short. And I always wondered why no one ever made her wash her hair. Her hair was always dirty and it was parted at the side like an awkward side - way over past a normal side part, like an old man comb over. And again I always wondered why did no one ever tell her to fix her hair? And she\\u2019s always worn these very baggy shaped overalls. As I look closely at her face - she has acne - I wonder what she would look like without the acne. None of the other kids have acne - they\\u2019re all really clean. I look at her features and I think she does look like the other kids - you can see the family resemblance. But yet, there\\u2019s something really different about her, and I realize I\\u2019m looking at androgyny. So now for the rest of the dream, I refer to her as them or they. And now whatever happened to the one that was around my age, that kid is gone. I\\u2019m now closest in age to \\u201cthem\\u201d - that child has no name in the dream. We start doing some things together. Although I realize that their mom loves them, I guess because there are so many kids in the family, she also doesn\\u2019t notice a lot of things that they actually do. I start to feel like a mom and I start to mother them a little bit. I don\\u2019t ask them about their hair. But I start trying to get to know them a little bit better - just asking them what they like to do and things. And they start to confide in me and they share that they don\\u2019t have a sexual identity - they don\\u2019t identify either as male or female. In fact as I get to know them a little better, I see both male and female, so beautifully intertwined in this being who has never been criticized or singled out for their preferences, so they\\u2019ve just been allowed to wear what they wanted to wear, and wear their hair the way they wanted to have their hair. Then on their sixteenth birthday, an envelope comes in the mail addressed to them, and they\\u2019re really excited as they open it. It\\u2019s a letter from the army! I say, \\u201cWow! I didn\\u2019t realize that you had any interest in joining the Army. What about this interests you?\\u201d And they say it\\u2019s about the beautiful uniforms and they start to describe the fabric and the shape of them and how they outline the strength of the shoulders - they taper down to here. They want to be an officer - not the infantry, the foot soldiers who fight, but an officer and organize this and be part of the structure. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Feedback Centre\\u201d In this dream I am in a conference center, but it\\u2019s not like a square room with a whole bunch of chairs lined up in rows and then there\\u2019s a raised stage with a podium or anything like that. It\\u2019s more like where you would go see a movie because there\\u2019s one wall where you take a number and you sit in some chairs like when you go get your driver\\u2019s license. So you\\u2019re sitting there and there\\u2019s a whole bunch of different windows. And you wait there until your number\\u2019s called and you go up to one window and receive your feedback. Then you\\u2019re allowed to take your feedback to tables that are set up more like round tables, some are rectangular and long though, they are different shapes. You can order food and you can meet people, you can talk to other people. It\\u2019s full of people. The atmosphere is very loud - it\\u2019s almost like there\\u2019s music going on, like satellite music being pumped in. There\\u2019s no point where anything is silent. It\\u2019s busy. It\\u2019s moving fast. There\\u2019s a service staff there that\\u2019s bringing people food and alcohol. And I\\u2019m finding that it\\u2019s overwhelming. I\\u2019m overstimulated. I don\\u2019t really want to be there anyway. I took a bus to get there. I left my peaceful quiet home to get on this bus to go get feedback which I\\u2019m a little excited to see, but I\\u2019m also dreading some because with feedback there\\u2019s always some that seems to be laced with people\\u2019s jealousies, base emotions. People that give feedback don\\u2019t really understand what the program was. As well as positive feedback. So it\\u2019s with mixed emotions that arrive at this place, the Feedback Centre, to receive my feedback. It\\u2019s not clear on what program I\\u2019m teaching or participating in. Some of the feedback is just on conversations that you\\u2019ve had with people or things that you\\u2019ve said. So it\\u2019s vast and at the same time really specific. So I line up. I\\u2019ve got my number in my hand and wait until I\\u2019m called. I\\u2019m chatting with other people - just mindless talk, it\\u2019s small talk. I receive my feedback. I\\u2019ve got it in my hands and there\\u2019s a whole bunch of different papers. It\\u2019s like the things people would fold up and put in a feedback box, so when you empty the box out, there\\u2019s all these small folded up pieces of paper. I have them in my hand. I\\u2019m looking around to see if there\\u2019s anyone I know at these tables so I can sit down and sort through this and I do. I see a group of friends that I know (I know them in real life as well) - they used to be my neighbors and I still see them, sometimes we go out dancing together. So I go and sit with them. Some of them have already ordered food. Some of them have already ordered a drink. I realize that they are not even there to get feedback. They\\u2019re there to just participate in a dinner out together, so they\\u2019re celebrating someone\\u2019s birthday. But that\\u2019s okay. They see me and they wave, \\u201cHey Freya\\u201d and I go sit with them. I start looking through my feedback. One of them asks me if I\\u2019m going to get something to eat or drink. I say no, I\\u2019m going to be going soon. I\\u2019m sorting through my feedback pile, opening up all the papers, flattening them out, setting them in a pile. A server comes over and asks me if I\\u2018m going to get anything. What am I going to order, she says. I tell her I\\u2019m not going to stay very long. She says, \\u201cWell you have to order something in order to sit at this table.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cOkay then please feel free to set a menu down here.\\u201d So I start looking through the feedback and in my dream I\\u2019m not reading any of it. It\\u2019s like the words aren\\u2019t even in English, they're just like blah blah blah, until I get to one that says, \\u201cYour feedback is too ripe.\\u201d And the \\u201ctoo ripe\\u201d is in quotation marks. And I think, \\u201cMy feedback? What have I even given feedback on?\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to scroll through my mind and think what I\\u2019ve done in the last year where I\\u2019m providing feedback to others. And I see it\\u2019s signed by Oake, and I realize it\\u2019s Oake from my Priestess School. So while I\\u2019m sitting there thinking what she could mean by that and what does too ripe mean, the server comes by and I order a salad and a cider. She goes away. And then one of the neighbors starts talking to me and she\\u2019s describing her vacation and asking me if I\\u2019m going to go on one. She says she\\u2019s single and would I come on one with her and I\\u2019ll be her roommate. She starts describing its attributes and stuff, so I\\u2019m a little distracted from my feedback pile but I\\u2019m enjoying the conversation and actually considering going on the vacation with her. So I leave my pile of feedback notes and she grabs me by the hand and takes me over to this other table. They have brochures for sunny vacations and she\\u2019s all excited and animated about it and she\\u2019s telling me some of the ones she\\u2019s been to or where she wants to go. Suddenly there\\u2019s a portal in that table and it opens up and we\\u2019re at a pool. I\\u2019m in a bathing suit. So is she. We dive down into the swimming pool and swim more than a couple of lengths - enough swimming so that I look at her and say, \\u201cOkay i can\\u2019t swim anymore!\\u201d And she says, \\u201cAlright let\\u2019s get out.\\u201d So we get out and dry ourselves off. We put our towels around our waist and go up and look. There\\u2019s a freezer full of M&M\\u2019s food - it\\u2019s premade food you can order, all in cardboard boxes - they have stores with just a sea of cardboard boxes of premade food. It\\u2019s disgusting and I don\\u2019t want any. She\\u2019s pulling out all different kinds of boxes and getting really excited about her purchases and by this time I really don\\u2019t want to participate in that. I\\u2019m trying to think of how to get out of it politely without offending her. So I just tell her I\\u2019ll carry her boxes for her and I do. Here we are in bare feet now with towels wrapped around our waists, in bathing suits, walking up a street and getting on a bus, going to her house, dropping them off. She stays there and now I\\u2019m standing there and I feel slightly out of place and uncomfortable in my bathing suit with no shoes on. I can feel the grit of the road and the sidewalk and the dirt from the floor of the bus. I get back on there with my towel wrapped around my waist, go back to the Feedback Centre, walk in and now I don\\u2019t know where my actual clothes are because they\\u2019re in this portal from the table with the vacation brochures. I go back to my table. My friends are now eating dessert. My salad and cider seem to have disappeared. I pick up my feedback stacks and I look at them and I feel some kind of umbrage that after all of the stuff that I\\u2019ve done for Oake for her school to help her that her feedback for me is that mine is too ripe. As I sit with this, I realize that I have given feedback to her school that she took and was appreciative of it at the time and actually followed through on some of it and it improved her situation. And I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, and now you\\u2019re telling me in this not directly to my face way that it\\u2019s too ripe.\\u201d I realize that she means it\\u2019s too blunt, it\\u2019s too straightforward, she wants it to be softer and padded with flowery poetic language and stuff so that it doesn\\u2019t cut through to the chaste so well. The last part of the dream is the person who is celebrating the birthday that all these neighbors are there for, I realize I don\\u2019t have a gift and everybody else has given him something. I feel obligated to do so, so I go out to the parking lot and my daughter or my nephew is there and I tell him/her this and they give me a bag of caramel corn to give to this guy and a birthday bag to put it in. So I go walking back in with the bag of caramel corn. I find him. I\\u2019m feeling kind of ashamed of the gift because he\\u2019s getting purchased things and gadgets and stuff. I walk over and give him the bag and say, \\u201cKiss on a cheek. Happy Birthday. Sorry, I didn\\u2019t realize it was your birthday when I came here.\\u201d He takes the gift and says thank you. I turn around and walk away, take my feedback things from the table, deposit them in the used bin, so it checks off my name that I\\u2019ve had it. I turn around and see that he\\u2019s put all the gadgety gifts and everybody is excitedly digging into the bag of caramel corn. So instead of being a 3x6 inch one, it\\u2019s now this giant back of carmel corn and they\\u2019re all like,\\u201d Woohoo! Caramel Corn! This is the best gift ever.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Flying Machine\\u201d In this dream I\\u2019m at my dad and stepmother\\u2019s cottage. It\\u2019s located in the Boreal Forest and the forest is so thick that you can\\u2019t possibly walk through it. There\\u2019s no path. There\\u2019s no space between the trees and the underbrush. So, there\\u2019s just a clearing. My stepmother makes sure that I understand I\\u2019m not allowed to sleep in the main cottage, so I have a cabana - a small one room that fits a single bed cot. There\\u2019s nothing else in it, just a cot. It\\u2019s made of wood and it has a roof and a door. This is where I sleep and I have a flying machine - it\\u2019s made of metal and taffeta - weather-proof material that tents are made out of and actually windsurfer sails are also made out of it. It\\u2019s like a parasailor. I think in real life, people are led up to gliders to a cliff and then they\\u2019re strapped in and then they glide all the way down. This is what it is, only it has a bottom, so I can actually cross my legs, sit in the stretched taffeta material and operate the lever that will lift the wings out so I can go higher or lower that one side of the wing down so I start to come back down towards the earth. So I\\u2019m wearing a dress and I walk from my cabana down to the shore, get in my flying machine, and the wind just takes me up. And it\\u2019s amazing. It\\u2019s so quiet up there - the quiet has texture to it and it just goes through my whole body and I orgasm. I fly around for a while and then I shift the gear and come back down and land the plane. I\\u2019ve done this before and I have a picture of me flying it with a friend in it. The friend is there on the shore, but she won\\u2019t come up with me in it, although the dream is in multiple timelines so I know she has. She just doesn\\u2019t during this particular dream. And then my stepmother creates some drama. She doesn\\u2019t want it on the dock and stuff, so I speak to a neighbor and the neighbor tells me it\\u2019s fine to leave it there. So I go up in it again and fly around and it\\u2019s just so peaceful and so freeing and then I land it when it\\u2019s time down on the neighbor\\u2019s dock. My stepmother is a little bit pissed off, but what can I say, it\\u2019s not her dock. So I go and sleep in the cabana and listen to the birds and the sounds of nature. I go up and down in this thing multiple times. I try to convince my friend to come with me, but she\\u2019s scared. I take her for a dry run in it where we don\\u2019t leave the land. She doesn\\u2019t want to go in it though, so she just wanders off. I fly in it again, land it, and then in the dream, I become bored with doing this in this one particular place. I\\u2019m not really welcomed in the cottage, so I decide to do something else and the dream exits that forest and I go back to the city.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fortune Teller\\u201d I\\u2019m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It\\u2019s summer. It\\u2019s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It\\u2019s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I\\u2019m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I\\u2019m with some friends. I can\\u2019t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s aunt. She\\u2019s in the boat that I\\u2019m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She\\u2019s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I\\u2019ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who\\u2019s driving the boat is not me. It\\u2019s a motorboat - something I don\\u2019t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I\\u2019m hazy on one that is - it\\u2019s not water skiing, it\\u2019s not floating, I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we\\u2019re staying. I guess I\\u2019m in a motel because it\\u2019s on the ground. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I\\u2019m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It\\u2019s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it\\u2019s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There\\u2019s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it\\u2019s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I\\u2019ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there\\u2019s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They\\u2019ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that\\u2019s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she\\u2019s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she\\u2019s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she\\u2019s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that\\u2019s complete. So they\\u2019re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life\\u2019s purpose. I\\u2019m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I\\u2019m really surprised that she\\u2019s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there\\u2019s somebody ahead of me. I don\\u2019t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don\\u2019t go in with her and I haven\\u2019t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she\\u2019s advertised. I don\\u2019t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She\\u2019s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She\\u2019s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she\\u2019s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they\\u2019re laughing like, \\u201cWow! I can\\u2019t imagine myself doing this!\\u201d Or \\u201cI\\u2019m so surprised at what she said!\\u201d These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They\\u2019re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it\\u2019s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it\\u2019s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren\\u2019t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I\\u2019m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She\\u2019s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It\\u2019s a woman I know. I\\u2019m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life\\u2019s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there\\u2019s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she\\u2019s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives. She says, \\u201cWow I\\u2019ve made $350 doing this.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a \\u201cwho knew?!\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYou are making this up?\\u201d She\\u2019s speaking as though she\\u2019s making it up. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Fun House\\u201d We are at a carnival. It\\u2019s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I\\u2019m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don\\u2019t really want to because I know they aren\\u2019t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they\\u2019re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she\\u2019s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that\\u2019s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I\\u2019ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They\\u2019re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She\\u2019s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it\\u2019s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We\\u2019re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there\\u2019s a door. It brings us into something we\\u2019re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We\\u2019re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don\\u2019t have the shoes on because I\\u2019m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they\\u2019re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn\\u2019t make me put the shoes on. I\\u2019m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she\\u2019s glaring at me, I also retort, \\u201cWould I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.\\u201d I think I said Christian, but I can\\u2019t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she\\u2019s moved back and I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good. Maybe she won\\u2019t bother me anymore.\\u201d On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a window, but it\\u2019s close to the ground - it\\u2019s a crawlspace. She\\u2019s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She\\u2019s looking at something on the other side. I don\\u2019t feel like crawling there. I can see that she\\u2019s jumping up and down. She\\u2019s excited about what she sees, so I\\u2019m content to sit on the other side and wait until she\\u2019s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it\\u2019s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she\\u2019s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It\\u2019s dark. We don\\u2019t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it\\u2019s dissonant. It\\u2019s really unpleasant. I think, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.\\u201d So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it\\u2019s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he\\u2019s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She\\u2019s a naturopath. She\\u2019s there with Trisha. i wonder what they\\u2019re doing because the carnival doesn\\u2019t seem like their thing. I\\u2019m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, \\u201cYes, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d Instead of staying on the ground, we\\u2019re suddenly transported upwards a little. I\\u2019d say we\\u2019re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They\\u2019re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they\\u2019re ants and they\\u2019re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He\\u2019s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he\\u2019s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn\\u2019t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Grid\\u201d In my dream last night, I\\u2019m a time traveler. The framework of the dream is set up on a grid system. I have lived in Toronto, Ontario, but I don\\u2019t live there now (for a short period of time I was there) and it\\u2019s a very easy city to get to know if you spend some time on the grid, which is a north-south-east-west system. In the dream, if you stop at a washroom or go down into the subway, you end up in a different time zone when you come out. So the whole dream is me trying to gather people together so that we\\u2019re all going into these wormholes at the same time so we don\\u2019t lose each other. The interesting thing is I keep waking up out of this dream and then going back to sleep and simply picking up where it left off. But every time I go back to sleep. I\\u2019m trying to regather the people that I was with before I woke up. The dream starts and I\\u2019m with my own family and one of the places in the grid is a restaurant, but it\\u2019s one of the older kinds of restaurants where the upstairs also has sleeping rooms for travelers. Not all of the people in that time zone are good people, so I\\u2019m warning my daughter to stay away from one of these girls because I can just tell by the look of her that she\\u2019s a thief and a prostitute. She\\u2019s sizing us up and I know if we don\\u2019t keep our money and valuables safe, she will steal from us. I\\u2019m trying to get the door of the restaurant locked because the prostitute has gone off with Omar and I don\\u2019t want her to come back in because I don\\u2019t want her to follow us through the next wormhole. So I do manage to keep the door locked and the prostitute comes out an hour later from the doorway and she has only her underwear on and her bra and she\\u2019s saying she\\u2019s desperately trying to get in and I know this is part of the trick because I can tell by her face that she\\u2019s not really upset. And I just know this. I do manage to succeed in convincing them to keep the door locked. Then I see her coming out of a different doorway about five minutes later. She gets up and she\\u2019s fully dressed and I can see in her hand that she has two different wallets, so she managed to get them from someone else, but not us. So this is going to sound funny, but it\\u2019s winter in the dream on the grid, and I\\u2019ve got my kids\\u2019 things to carry plus some supplies - food and an extra change of clothes. And my daughter is pushing me around in a shopping cart - she keeps telling me to get in with my stuff and it\\u2019s hard to push it because it\\u2019s a shopping cart and the snow keeps building up on the wheels. So we\\u2019re putting the heavy things in there and I\\u2019m having a hard time pushing it and my daughter keeps wanting me to get in there and rest, and she is pushing me around so we look like homeless people. We go into this other portal and come out on the other side and it\\u2019s a party. It\\u2019s packed with people and there are people that I know. So, one of these couples that I know are people that I know from the Sail Club, and I realize that the man is screwing around on the woman and I think, \\u201cOh no, that\\u2019s horrible!\\u201d And I wrestle with the idea of telling her. And I don\\u2019t yet because it\\u2019s a really tough decision to make and is it any of my business, and what effects of that decision will it have on others. So while I\\u2019m wrestling with that decision, I realize that she is actually aware of it and just doesn\\u2019t appear to either care or acknowledge it, so I don\\u2019t tell her. In the same scene, there\\u2019s another little girl and she\\u2019s being shadowed by a teenage girl. So the first girl is 8 and the other is maybe 16. They go into the showers and I\\u2019m standing there because I\\u2019m on this other girl because of the shadowing. So they both get into the same shower and I\\u2019m thinking this isn\\u2019t right. And then I walk in and look and they are showering together and they are undressed. I step in and open the door and I ask the younger girl, \\u201cAre you alright?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t answer me. So I glare at the other one and fierce her down and take the younger girl and put some clothes on her because her clothes have disappeared, so I\\u2019m just taking some various things and covering her up with them. I say, \\u201cIs this yours? Is this yours?\\u201d and people say, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not mine,\\u201d and so I put a various eclectic wardrobe on her. And then I\\u2019m wandering around the party with her in my hand asking anyone if they know who this girl is because she doesn\\u2019t talk. People will say, \\u201cOh, I saw her with so and so,\\u201d and then the so and so won\\u2019t be there and there\\u2019s different so and so\\u2019s every time and I can\\u2019t find who this girl belongs to. But then I\\u2019m starting to get concerned that I\\u2019m getting sucked into or overly involved with the dynamics of the people at this party and I\\u2019m afraid that I will forget that I\\u2019m a time traveler and that I\\u2019ll lose my time traveler family, so I start to gather up the people that I came with - my daughter, some other nameless people who are just there, they are part of my travel group - and I\\u2019m looking for someone now. I say I need someone to take care of her for me, and this couple - the oblivious woman and the man who is screwing around on her all the time - say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take her. We\\u2019ll love her. We love everybody.\\u201d In the dream I\\u2019m not concerned that she\\u2019ll be sexually abused. I know that they are going to take care of her. They\\u2019re good people, they just have this other weird cake. And so I leave her with them and get back into the shopping cart outside of the door and we go down and I\\u2019m starting to recognize streets. I\\u2019m starting to look a lot more closely at the grid because I want to plan where we\\u2019re going and not just go into any door and be more conscious of the grid. I\\u2019m starting to feel more textures in the dream. So as I climb back in the cart, I\\u2019m feeling that the front handle of it is actually cold and it\\u2019s plastic feeling and the metal of the cart is even colder and I\\u2019m trying to pull the sleeve of my coat down over my hand so it won\\u2019t stick to it. It\\u2019s actually not that comfortable riding in it because the wheels keep getting stuck and it\\u2019s bumpy. But this is what she wants to do and I let her. We have some conversations. She\\u2019s still bothered by locking the prostitute out of the first scene, and I tell her that regardless of what we did she would still steal everyone\\u2019s wallets and she would still make the same choices and it\\u2019s not our purpose to try and change people\\u2019s choices here, but to learn the grid and to find our way through it. So I\\u2019m starting to read the signs and I\\u2019m recognizing where we are - what starts to become a sense of direction in the grid. My daughter keeps steering the cart. Now I don\\u2019t know where my consciousness goes during this - maybe I go to sleep in the dream and I wake up. Instead of staying on the grid we\\u2019ve gone off to side grid things and we\\u2019re in smaller parts because she likes them better because they are closer together and more intimate, but they don\\u2019t have any identifying characteristics. So it\\u2019s a lot harder for me to find the main patterns of the grid when she does this, but we do. So the second time I dive in and dive out, it\\u2019s me finding our way out of this non-identifiable part onto more of the main grid. And then we come to a wormhole that I know we\\u2019re supposed to go into and I don\\u2019t want to go in, so I linger outside of it. Now it\\u2019s just my daughter and I. Because she went off the grid, we lost the other people we were supposed to be traveling with. I\\u2019m hoping that by staying on the grid, we\\u2019ll find them the next time we pop up somewhere. I also think that maybe if we wait, they might pop up out of this wormhole because I think they\\u2019re going to be looking for us. So while we\\u2019re waiting around this one crossroads, I talk or make a connection with an older man. At first he\\u2019s just an older man. We just have a conversation about some kind of philosophy or something. I\\u2019m not really paying much attention to the conversation. Then we decide to go down into the wormhole and we do, and we\\u2019re staying together and I\\u2019m giving her instructions, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gotta make sure we don\\u2019t get separated. Don\\u2019t go off onto any areas without telling me.\\u201d We pop up successfully and I see the rest of the people that we\\u2019re supposed to be with and we rush and we connect back with them. In the dream I don\\u2019t remember exactly what they said, but they\\u2019re telling us what happened during their wormhole experience. The interesting thing about this as the dream is starting to come to a close is that together we find the next wormhole that we\\u2019re supposed to dive into, but people keep needing to go to the washroom. But I\\u2019m telling them they can\\u2019t do this because each washroom is a wormhole and we\\u2019re supposed to stay together. Some of them decide to do it anyway and I know that here we go again, we\\u2019re going to get sidetracked from our purpose. Well, we keep trying to find each other. And then I see this old man again and he\\u2019s standing up - he\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am. Now as I start talking to him I\\u2019m not just seeing him for what his profession is with small talk, but I start to feel beyond the surface of his skin into the character and kind of being he is, and he\\u2019s just so beautiful on the inside. My being feels his being. I tell him that once I go down into the wormhole, I won\\u2019t ever see him again. And he says, \\u201cyes, I know.\\u201d And then we just start to hug, but it\\u2019s the kind of hug where you just kind of fall into the other person - it\\u2019s not a squeezy hug, it\\u2019s just so enveloping and I just stand there. It seems like five minutes go by and I\\u2019m so comforted by this hug. And I realize as we\\u2019re doing this that we also need to not get so preoccupied with staying on the grid, that we\\u2019re missing the connections with the people that are in between wormholes. And then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Inner City\\u201d In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It\\u2019s really hot. There\\u2019s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I\\u2019m inside a building. It\\u2019s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I\\u2019m helping people. I don\\u2019t know the people I\\u2019m working with. So I\\u2019m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It\\u2019s really oddly shaped. It\\u2019s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It\\u2019s covered with sticky potato. I think it\\u2019s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there\\u2019s this big hose thing that\\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. It\\u2019s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I\\u2019m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there\\u2019s a sieve thing on it. I\\u2019m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they\\u2019re moving really fast. They\\u2019re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She\\u2019s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I\\u2019m helping. I feel like she\\u2019s centered me out as though I\\u2019m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn\\u2019t up to par. It\\u2019s a whole demeanor like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to watch you even closer.\\u201d She\\u2019s making me nervous now. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I\\u2019m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They\\u2019re trying to speed up and they\\u2019re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can\\u2019t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There\\u2019s a ramp and there\\u2019s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I\\u2019ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I\\u2019m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don\\u2019t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I\\u2019m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They\\u2019re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren\\u2019t. She\\u2019s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She\\u2019s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there\\u2019s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t she put the bigger rock that\\u2019s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?\\u201d Now I notice that she\\u2019s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she\\u2019s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She\\u2019s calling the thigh bone a \\u201cfemoris\\u201d but in a sing-song type voice. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cUh, no!\\u201d But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, \\u201cI wonder if they knew she was in there?\\u201d I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We\\u2019re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There\\u2019s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we\\u2019re instructed to sit back into child\\u2019s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It\\u2019s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I\\u2019m stretching and there\\u2019s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don\\u2019t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I\\u2019m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I\\u2019m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I\\u2019m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I\\u2019m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone\\u2019s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I\\u2019m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Island of Avalon\\u201d I\\u2019m in a flatbed boat like a pontoon boat with several people, some of them I don\\u2019t know. There\\u2019s a woman with dark hair pulled back into a bun. She has higher cheekbones and slightly Asian features. I have two friends who I do know in real life - Julie and Alice, Keith and a couple other people who I don't interact with enough to see their features, so I can\\u2019t describe them or give them names. We are on a daytrip to an island. For our entertainment, we have each brought a guitar. I have mine, although I don\\u2019t take it out of its pack. Alice has one. Julie is playing something that sounds like a guitar but it has no body, just a neck which looks like a broom handle with a string that goes from one end to the other and acts like a guitar strap so you can put it around the back of your neck. She\\u2019s playing a non-existent fretboard. Her hands go up and down the broom handle making guitar-like sounds. When Alice brings hers out I comment that I didn\\u2019t realize she could play the guitar. She says she\\u2019s been playing for some time. It\\u2019s a sunny day - the skies are blue, it\\u2019s pleasant and balmy. The waters are a bit choppy but it\\u2019s not alarming in any sense, so everybody is kind of relaxed. The woman with the dark hair in a bun says we\\u2019ll be arriving in a couple of hours so just continue what we\\u2019re doing which is playing songs. Alice is leading the song. She plays the first fret, second fret, then up to fourth fret in bar chords. I get my guitar out and using the same fretboard pattern I begin to pick out a melody. At one point she stops me, corrects me and tells me that she\\u2019s playing a finger pattern with E Major with the first index finger barring the strings on the first, second and fourth fret. I tell her that\\u2019s exactly what I was doing. She sits back down. We eventually get close to the island. The woman with the dark hair bun tells us we\\u2019ll be there in a few minutes, so we all start stowing away what we\\u2019ve got out and putting it into our packs so we\\u2019re organized. We pull up to a dock and tie up. Everybody gets out, walks up the dock, up a path and into a small cottage. Inside the cottage, we put various things away. People eat. There is some discussion and conversation during the making of food, but it\\u2019s not a community meal because we\\u2019ve each brought our own things. So basically we\\u2019re just cooking it up then eating. There is some kind of event that we\\u2019ve come for. When it\\u2019s announced, because it\\u2019s all couples I say I\\u2019m going to stay behind. The woman says, \\u201cAre you sure? There will be dancing after.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not doing this couples thing by myself.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve elected to stay behind. However, after the meal, we walk back to the boat and I\\u2019m needed to help cast off. So I do this. Then I linger for a little while on the dock while the others sail off on the small barge. I stay there and am relaxing, feeling my breath and lying on my back looking up at the sky, feeling the gentle movement of the water. I don\\u2019t know how long I stay there, but it\\u2019s still daylight when I decide to go back to the small cottage. When I arrive there I see my friend Keith has also stayed back and he\\u2019s putting some things into his pockets. He has something the size and shape of an aerosol can. He takes that in one hand and takes the lid from a deep pocket in his pants and places it on. Then he\\u2019s taking something else out of his back pocket that I realize is a used condom and I think, \\u201cHmm, I wonder what he\\u2019s been doing...or it\\u2019s obvious what he\\u2019s been doing while we were gone.\\u201d He\\u2019s about to dispose of these items in the garbage when the woman with dark hair comes back in and he hurriedly tucks them back in his pocket. He doesn\\u2019t want her to see. She tells us that if we want to find out what happened ten years ago, we\\u2019d better hurry but we\\u2019re not to let on we\\u2019re looking for this or the people that live here will not share information. So we exit out the cottage following her deeper into the island. We\\u2019re in a gathering place in a village. There are people, but when I look at them, I sense that they\\u2019ve lived there for generations and are not used to strangers because they\\u2019re staring at us oddly. It\\u2019s not an entirely welcoming stare as I interpret hostility. We are looking for some indication that a cataclysmic event happened ten years ago. So we are looking for disruptions in the smooth running of events or maybe that the town hall is missing some dates of town hall meetings from ten years ago. In fact, we find this evidence on the front of the town hall, itself! There\\u2019s a pole in front of the town hall building that has dates etched into it and there is a disruption. That\\u2019s when I see that the name of the island is Avalon. There\\u2019s a period of time where there are no dates and it is in fact ten years ago. I try not to react or look at my companions as though I\\u2019ve noticed something. We continue to wander around the village looking for such evidence as to corroborate this. The sky begins to be less bright. I look up and notice the sun is beginning to set. I realize we must make our way back to the cottage we\\u2019re staying in. Without verbalizing this to my companions, we just begin to retrace our steps back to the path to the cottage. By the time we get to the cottage, it\\u2019s twilight. We go in. we\\u2019re having a discussion - the dark haired lady, Keith and me - about what we\\u2019ve found. We each found different things to confirm that something tragic happened there ten years ago. The people who live there either don\\u2019t remember and have some kind of amnesia or they do remember, but are refusing to talk about it and don\\u2019t want anyone else to know. While we\\u2019re having this discussion, the rest of the group that went to the event come back in and they are not there to track what we\\u2019re tracking. At this point, my recall is not sharp. There\\u2019s no sleeping or staying overnight in the cottage. We simply leave the next day and it\\u2019s daylight. The other friends that attended the event are oblivious of what we\\u2019ve done and we\\u2019re simply back in the little barge with the same guitars singing the same songs and heading away from the island as though the island didn\\u2019t even really exist and we never even stopped there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Kingdom\\u201d I arrive. The road here was bumpy. I step out and walk in through a stone archway into an open area. I am greeted by a few people I appear to know already. They\\u2019re telling me some news and saying that the king has been very sad lately and is not doing well at all. They haven\\u2019t seen him in a little while, but he\\u2019s still there. We go through the open stone area - it\\u2019s a large room made of stone. We go out a side opening. Everything is very rocky and I realize this whole structure is built on the side of an escarpment. It\\u2019s built into the rock that\\u2019s part of the escarpment. I walk downhill over this rocky dry land. I come to a lower area. There are some more people, maybe 3 or 4. I think they\\u2019re fishing. Some people are standing in the water up to their thighs. I don\\u2019t really understand the clothing. Some have rolled their clothing up to the top of their thighs. Others are wearing muslin over top and it\\u2019s getting wet in the water but no one seems to care. I go in the water and roll my dress up and tuck it in. I can feel the skin on my legs and the coolness of the water. I can feel the rocks under my feet and some of them are a bit slippery and some are a bit sharp. I have to go in the water very, very carefully. I\\u2019m only standing in the water for a few minutes when a young man comes towards me. He seems to have some kind of authority. I also know him really well. We converse for a little bit. He tells me of some of the problems. He tells me there\\u2019s been some changes and deaths. Basically, I gather that everything is still intact. At this point I realize there\\u2019s another property. There\\u2019s a road that goes from the property we have, down into where the rocks descend in altitude and then ascend again to this other property. Everyone calls this other property a castle. But no one has been there for a really long time because the king hasn\\u2019t wanted to go there. The reason there\\u2019s activity right now is that he\\u2019s decided that he\\u2019s going to open it up again, so there\\u2019s preparations and excitement in the air. At this point, the conversation is that the king is coming down or getting up - I\\u2019m not sure which one. There\\u2019s another young man who is older than my friend. People are calling him the prince. I see the King and he has painted his skin with woad. He\\u2019s been doing this for a long time. People are saying it\\u2019s because of his grief. The woad painting is part of this culture and it\\u2019s not unusual to anyone. We ascend back up the rocky part I had just climbed down. Now my friend - the younger prince - is holding my elbow because now I\\u2019m wet and barefoot. We go back into the original opening in the rock that I arrived into. Now the king comes in this same opening. I see that his face is lined more with a lot more wrinkles. The woad is covering some of the wrinkles. He\\u2019s also used some kind of black powder to create upward sweeps between his brows to his brow line and from his bottom lip down through the center of his chin. It\\u2019s making him look angrier and more expressive of that emotion. I can see underneath all this paint to the face I have known before. Everything is made out of this rock from the land. There\\u2019s a rock inside here that we use as a seat. We sit. He starts talking to me. He feels like a fatherly figure but I get the impression that he is not my father. He sits down and tells me that we\\u2019re going to be opening the other part today and he\\u2019s ready to finally face this challenge. He\\u2019s also looking forward to it because it\\u2019s reuniting everyone in his kingdom. It\\u2019s difficult to get to, though. The road is overgrown. He indicates that there\\u2019s been a zipline installed at the top of this open window carved into the rock. Everyone is going to have to zipline down to the other castle. I agree and say, \\u201cThis is fine, I can do that.\\u201d My friend tells me he appreciates me being there. At this point, two men in suits enter in through the opening. They\\u2019re smiling. The king stands up and greets them. They tell him that they have some good news for him. They start talking, telling him that someone wants to give him some money for a piece of the road. They say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got it all written up on this contract. It will all be very friendly. You\\u2019ll get all this money and it\\u2019s just for this one section of road that goes from this piece of land to the castle.\\u201d I can feel myself getting really angry inside. I look over at the king and he seems to be considering it, which makes me even more angry. All of a sudden I stand up and yell at them: \\u201cHow dare you come in here with your lies! You tell him that this will be okay. I know you\\u2019re going to trick him. You\\u2019re going to get him to sell that and then he won\\u2019t have any access to his home. You\\u2019re trying to force him through this treachery to sell his own home.\\u201d Now they\\u2019re really angry. The king says, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019m not going to do that.\\u201d He yells at them and tells them to get out. They pack up their papers and leave. Nobody says anything to me about my outburst. The preparations continue. Each person is holding one thing. Suddenly I look down and see if I have some kind of tray. There are a whole bunch of things on it, but I don\\u2019t know what they are. My mind thinks: \\u201cHow are they going to stay on while on a zipline? Aren\\u2019t they going to fly off?\\u201d We start going towards the opening. The oldest son takes the zipline first. You can\\u2019t even see him at first - he goes way down and then he goes up and through the trees. I think it looks like he made it. My conscious mind is thinking this looks more like a T-bar from a ski hill. Another one arrives but I let it go past just in case the older one slows down when he goes up the last ascension. Then I put the tray on this next one. As I watch it go on the zipline, nothing slides off. I think, \\u201cHmm.\\u201d Then I take the next one. I grab on, sit on the T-bar part and zipline down. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Language\\u201d This dream is a little complicated to explain. The best way I can lay out the architecture is that it\\u2019s kind of like a spiral. The first layer, when I go through it, I\\u2019m not quite in it, then each layer I'm a little deeper in. There\\u2019s also a vehicle for getting there and I don\\u2019t know how to describe it. It doesn't move on the land. It\\u2019s not an airplane. It doesn\\u2019t go way high up in the sky. It hovers a little above the rooftops - perhaps the layer where birds are normally in, though I don\\u2019t see any birds in the dream. It moves really quickly. It moves through time, as well. So the dream begins. I\\u2019m exiting out of this vehicle into a town. I\\u2019m walking around the town looking for where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I don\\u2019t understand any of the language being spoken. So, I can\\u2019t ask anyone where to go. I\\u2019m just trying to feel my way around. I\\u2019m looking for a mental map of the things I need. For example, I\\u2019m looking for a place to eat, a place to study, a place to sleep. So the first time I go through here, I\\u2019m feeling ungrounded. I\\u2019m alienated because I don\\u2019t speak the language. But I\\u2019m starting to feel familiar with the urban landscape. There's a certain time I have to leave. I need to be back at that vehicle. So I\\u2019m rushing to get there. I get back in it and I leave. Then I re-enter that same town, exiting the vehicle. This time I\\u2019m looking for parks and recreational places. I\\u2019m looking for a place to swim and rest outside - not necessarily a beach, but a place I can rest after swimming. This time I have my son with me. We have found a place to rent bicycles and have rented a tandem bicycle. So I place my son on the back and I\\u2019m on the front. We both have little backpacks with what we need for the day. We are just leisurely riding around. We go to the place for swimming, not an ocean, I have a feeling it might be man made because it\\u2019s too small to be a lake. It\\u2019s quite beautiful. The water is clean and fresh, and there\\u2019s a groomed grassy area, as you would find in a park. We lay down some big towels that we\\u2019ve taken from our backpacks and we\\u2019re just lying there resting. It\\u2019s a nice day. After a little while we get hungry. I\\u2019ve already scouted a place where we can eat. So we get back on the bicycles and take our towels and everything with us. But our towels are wet and I notice that they\\u2019re wet when I put them in the packs. I\\u2019m thinking that we\\u2019ll need a place to spread them out so they don\\u2019t get moldy. So I take my son on the bicycle. We go to the place to eat. The food is good and tasty. I\\u2019m trying to decipher the language that the people speak. As I taste the food, I\\u2019m trying to taste the language. I\\u2019m trying to decipher it by noticing the flavors. When we\\u2019re both finished, instead of getting back on the bicycle, we walk through the urban area where we\\u2019ve eaten. I think, \\u201cWow, it would be really nice to have some kind of memento from the day.\\u201d So we enter one of the shops. It\\u2019s quite dingy. There are tables set out in garage sale type style. To enter the shop, you go through the door and downstairs to the basement, which is probably why it feels so dingy and dark. But the items on the table are quite expensive and big. A lot of them are made of big chunks of led crystal. I don\\u2019t want to carry something around like this - it\\u2019s not really my thing, anyway. They\\u2019re really rather formal. But we see this little spoon. It\\u2019s like a baby spoon, made of silver - it\\u2019s good metal. I look at the top of the spoon and it\\u2019s actually carved into - a rough rendition of Pikachu. I call my son over and say, \\u201cLook! Who\\u2019s that?\\u201d He says, \\u201cPikachu.\\u201d I say, yes. Pikachu is wearing a little hat with a small tiny delicate chain from the center of the hat down and there\\u2019s a hook on the end of it. There\\u2019s a hole drilled into the spoon and the hook sits there nicely, so it doesn\\u2019t dangle and it\\u2019s actually part of Pikachu\\u2019s hat. So I purchase the spoon and we put it in our backpack. Now I\\u2019m thinking we have to spread these towels. Now I\\u2019m wondering if we\\u2019re staying here and I\\u2019m starting to get a little bit nervous because it is getting dark. We don\\u2019t appear to be leaving in the vehicle and I haven\\u2019t arranged for us anywhere to sleep. So we\\u2019re back up on street level and I\\u2019m walking to where we entered this level. But then I see that more people are walking that way and I see the vehicle. We get in the vehicle and sleep on it. Nice passes really quickly, then we exit back out at daytime. This time I have both my son and daughter. My daughter is older than my son. I\\u2019m bringing them with me to a house that I\\u2019ve prearranged to meet someone in - someone I had forgotten that I met on the first voyage there. So we do this. We\\u2019re not on the bicycle this time, we\\u2019re just walking. We get to the house and there\\u2019s a library upstairs. So I take my kids up to the third floor and they\\u2019re in the library. Then I walk back to the first floor to meet the person I\\u2019m supposed to be studying the language with. It\\u2019s someone I feel I\\u2019ve met before - there\\u2019s some familiarity about the man. We sit at a table and he\\u2019s teaching me a word and I\\u2019m repeating it - that\\u2019s how I\\u2019m learning, back and forth rote memory style. Then I ask him, \\u201cIs there a washing machine here? I still have these things from the picnic and I need to wash and dry them. They are muddy and wet.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, there\\u2019s one in the basement. Help yourself.\\u201d So I take everything down, load the washing machine, put soap in it, and come back upstairs. Then I realize I\\u2019ve put my muddy pants in there and I\\u2019m just wearing my underwear and the shirt I had on underneath. I ask him if there\\u2019s anything I can borrow. He says, yes. He hands me a pair of pajama bottoms. So I wear those and we continue the language lesson. We continue for a bit longer, then I go back downstairs to switch the laundry and put things in the dryer. I come back up the stairs. This time, there\\u2019s a second person in there for a language lesson. I also recognize him - he\\u2019s a colleague. So now the first man I was learning from is tutoring someone else and I\\u2019m practicing the language with my colleague, Keith. We both have a test coming up and we\\u2019re studying together practicing this language. The first man who is the tutor comes back into the room with Keith and me. He says the time is up. Keith leaves. I go back and get our laundry and put in our packs. I thank the man for his time. My kids have come downstairs from the library and we get our packs. I never take the test. We just get back in the vehicle and leave. There\\u2019s one more layer where I come back. I exit the same vehicle into a landscape with the same kind of architecture. This time I don\\u2019t have my kids. I walk to the place where I had picnicked with my son. I\\u2019m taking my time. It\\u2019s a nice day. The weather is temperate - not too hot, not too cold. I\\u2019m not swimming. I\\u2019m just lying on the grass in meditation, looking at the clear blue sky. I rest there for some time. It feels really good. The day is only half gone and the vehicle isn\\u2019t coming back until the end of the day. So I still have half a day to spend. I don\\u2019t want to stay by the beach anymore. So I walk back through the small town. I\\u2019m not feeling particularly hungry. I end up at the house where I had studied before. Before I go in, I see the same man that had tutored me. There\\u2019s still a nagging question in my mind about where I had seen him before. He waves over to me and indicates that I should come in even though I don\\u2019t have an appointment. We go back into the room where I had the tutoring session before. He indicates with his hand that I should sit down. So I do. Only this time he has a plate of food. He divides it into two and pushes one plate over to me and keeps the other plate for himself. I\\u2019m eating this really, really slowly, trying to figure out the flavors. I don't even know what the food pieces are. So I\\u2019m eating slowly and thinking about it. He hands me this other thing. It is the size of a potato, but not as hard as a raw potato. It feels like a thick, doughy thing. I wonder what it is. He indicates that I should dip it into the food, then take a bite. So I do. It tastes somewhat bread like, but doughier. I still don\\u2019t understand the spices. Actually I don\\u2019t like the texture of it. After the first bite, I set it back down and continue to eat the food with my fingers. Then I wish I had the spoon I bought last time and gave to my son. Then he gets up and indicates for me to look at my legs. I see that my pants are all muddy again. He asks me in the language if I want to use the washing machine. I say yes. Then I stand there for a second. He takes that same soft pajama-like thing out of the door and hands it to me. So I go back downstairs to where the laundry is and I take the rest of the things from my pack because they aren\\u2019t clean either. I put everything into the washing machine and come back up with the soft clothing on. Now he\\u2019s sitting down on the floor. There\\u2019s something on the television, which I hadn\\u2019t noticed was there. I sit down on the floor beside him. I don\\u2019t understand the language that the people on the tv are using. So I kind of drift off and am daydreaming. I am just waiting for the laundry to finish. He comes over a little closer to me and I feel that there\\u2019s some kind of sexual energy between us. Then I suddenly remember who he is. He\\u2019s someone I had tea with on a meetup - I was just meeting him, but we never went on a date. But there\\u2019s energy there. He just brushes down my arm, down the side of my leg with his hand, like he is testing to see where this is going to go. I do feel my body respond - it\\u2019s warm. But I don\\u2019t really want to engage with him that way. I still acknowledge that it felt nice, though. He backs away, but doesn't go too far. He seems content with just acknowledging that the energy is there but not taking it any further. Then we move closer to each other again and just stay there, touching, until I think my laundry is done. Then I go to the basement, get the laundry, change and give him back the pajamas he lent me and go out the door to the vehicle to fly off somewhere.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Line Up\\u201d I\\u2019m in a doctor\\u2019s office but it\\u2019s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I\\u2019ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We\\u2019re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There\\u2019s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren\\u2019t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we\\u2019re looking at is the demographic of people who don\\u2019t believe in paying their bills online or don\\u2019t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can\\u2019t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we\\u2019re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they\\u2019re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It\\u2019s mostly elderly people. But there\\u2019s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It\\u2019s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I\\u2019m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, \\u201cMy appointment was at 8. It\\u2019s 3pm. I\\u2019m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?\\u201d The receptionist who looks like my son\\u2019s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry. This isn\\u2019t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone\\u2019s appointment was scheduled for 8am.\\u201d I feel like screaming at her but I don\\u2019t. I tell her that I understand it\\u2019s not her fault, but inside I\\u2019m frustrated and angry. I\\u2019m dizzy and starting to get a headache. I go back and sit down. Now it\\u2019s almost 5pm. There is a person that does the procedure I came for and I know they tend to leave a little bit earlier than the rest of the staff. I go back to the desk and say, \\u201cAm I still going to be able to get this done today?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, you have two choices. You can wait until we open in the morning or I can give you this syringe and you can inject yourself at home. You still have to wait for your appointment.\\u201dI have this dissonance between my inner landscape which is angry and frustrated and tired and hungry and thirsty with what I\\u2019m saying to her. I tell her I\\u2019ll take the syringe full of medicine. Then I say, \\u201cWell wait a sec, if I have to stay anyways, is she going to be back tomorrow?\\u201d She tells me she is. I say, \\u201cWell nevermind then, I might as well wait and have her do it properly since I have to stay here overnight anyway.\\u201d She hands it to me anyway, and says, \\u201cWell take it just in case.\\u201d She hands me a syringe full of liquid medicine. I go back and realize that while I\\u2019ve been talking to her someone who arrived after me has gone in and got their appointment. I\\u2019m unbelievably agitated. I also realize this is just great, I\\u2019m going to have to stay overnight because you\\u2019re not allowed to go home. If you go home they put you back in the line up, so it\\u2019s a never ending cycle of having to wait from 8am until the end of the day when they can\\u2019t even take you. I push two chairs together and try and stretch my body across the chairs. My friend is doing the same thing. We take off our coats and use them as pillows and lie down. The night passes with me not being able to sleep because I\\u2019m too hungry and too thirsty. I wish I had water. I\\u2019m feeling that restlessness in your legs from not getting enough exercise. So, I start to walk around the building. I walk around twenty times and then come back in and it\\u2019s past midnight. I get back in the chairs and go to sleep. I sleep for maybe five minutes and am woken up. Some part of the chair is sticking in my back - it\\u2019s wooden and pressing in my thigh so I feel like I\\u2019m getting a bruise. I stay awake until I see the morning light coming into the building. I sit up in my chair and see the people come back to the desk. I feel like threatening them somehow and saying I\\u2019d better be first! That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Long Anxious Drive\\u201d I\\u2019m in a car. There are two people in the front seat and I\\u2019m in the back seat. The person on the driver\\u2019s side is male. He has dark hair and those sideburns that I think they call lamb chops or dog ears because they come down from the temples and into this ear-shape around the jaw line and towards the chin, and they\\u2019re a bit long because I can see them sticking out from his face. He has two cars and I\\u2019m saying to him: \\u201cWhy would you pick this car instead of your other car? There\\u2019s only one car like this and it stands out. Now we\\u2019re going to be really obvious.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t reply. We\\u2019re stuck with it now because if we go back to his house to switch cars, the police will know that we\\u2019re there. We\\u2019re trying to avoid being detected by the police. We\\u2019re trying to avoid being caught. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019ve done. There\\u2019s nothing in the car and it\\u2019s almost as though we didn\\u2019t do anything but we can\\u2019t prove our innocence. So we have to avoid detection. We\\u2019re also trying to get to a particular destination. This is also what\\u2019s adding to the anxiety. The driver is sticking to the main roads. I\\u2019ve told him several times that if he just goes off the main road there\\u2019s a whole grid of side roads that will take us the same direction, but the chances of getting caught on a side road are greatly reduced. First we\\u2019re on a highway. It looks like the old Number 7. Again, I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cWhy are we on this highway? It\\u2019s the only main route that goes here and there are police on it all the time.\\u201d He finally agrees to go off on a side road, but it\\u2019s not the one I suggested, it\\u2019s the one that takes us in the opposite direction. I think at least that will shake the police for a little while because they\\u2019re going to be looking for us traveling the opposite way. We do this for an agonizingly long twenty minutes. It feels like hours where I notice every single little thing as I\\u2019m looking at the windows. I\\u2019m hypervigilant and looking out the back window to see if I can see a police car. My eyes are glued to the back window. Then I suggest again: \\u201cIf we turn around and take one of the side roads going the other way, we\\u2019ll be getting closer to our destination instead of farther away from it.\\u201d We\\u2019re running out of gas so we have to stop at a gas station. This makes me even more anxious because what if there is an APB out on the license plate and the gas station attendants report us. It\\u2019s just horrible. We stop for the gas. I\\u2019m watching the attendants and ready to jump back in the car if it looks like one of them is going for a phone. I\\u2019m standing at the back of the car to try and cover up the license plate with my body. It goes well at the gas station. We get back in the car. No one has called the police. We start going the other way. Then the driver, when we get to the highway again, he turns left so we\\u2019re on the highway. Now the highway has stop lights on it and every two minutes there\\u2019s a red light. This is making me crazy with anxiety because now we\\u2019re going even more slowly. I finally convince him to turn right so that we\\u2019re on a side road. I can relax a little. I realize how unbelievably tired I am, yet I still can\\u2019t go to sleep. They\\u2019re driving. I\\u2019m looking out the back window and I can see some headlights. By now it\\u2019s dark and all I can see are the headlights and they\\u2019re really, really bright. I think this is it, we\\u2019re done for. But then the car behind us with the headlights turns off to the right. I feel a little bit relieved. Then there\\u2019s a stop sign and the car stops. I have my eyes peeled out the back, I don\\u2019t see any cars coming. We start driving again. The whole dream goes on and on like this, painstakingly slow and horrible. Then I\\u2019m aware that I\\u2019m dreaming and I\\u2019m aware I\\u2019m awake. I\\u2019m aware of the dream. My conscious mind says it\\u2019s had enough and doesn\\u2019t want to dream this anymore, so I just get up and turn on the lights.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Monster Outside the Window\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m sleeping in a room on the upper floor of a house. I don\\u2019t recognize the house. It has two windows that are gabled. In front of one of the windows, entering in the room, is a closet - it is not a very big one. It has two bars on either side of it with clothes hanging on. It\\u2019s probably about 7 feet from the internal door of the closet to the window. I can see the window outside of the closet. It\\u2019s almost like the closet, if you look right at it is a closet with solid walls; but when I\\u2019m in bed, I can see what\\u2019s outside of the window - both of them at the same time. So it\\u2019s almost like the walls have color and appear to be dense, yet I can see through them. The dream starts with me going to bed and I wake up in the middle of the night. I can see there\\u2019s something terrible - something I\\u2019m afraid of - outside of the window. I\\u2019m afraid to move in my bed. I don\\u2019t go back to sleep and I stay there until the morning. The day just passes in a blur. Then I go back to bed and again, I\\u2019m trying to go to sleep, but I\\u2019m awake because I know that thing is going to come back and it\\u2019s going to be outside my window again. In fact, I start to realize that it\\u2019s always outside of the window. Then, as I\\u2019m lying in bed awake, I start to get a little bit curious about what exactly it is outside of the window. So I get out of my bed and I open the door and I peek into the closet. Nothing happens yet. So I open the door a little wider and I go a little bit more into the closet. Now I\\u2019m just standing in the closet. I can feel its presence through the window pane. I\\u2019m just standing there. As I\\u2019m standing there, my ex-husband comes into the room. He starts making noise and stuff. I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing in here? Please stop.\\u201d He ignores me and comes into the closet. He says, \\u201cI have to get a shirt.\\u201d I tell him to stop, \\u201cStop doing that, you\\u2019re going to disturb it.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t. Then the thing starts to come closer to the window. Then I realize that my ex-husband and this thing are in some kind of tango together. I realize that it\\u2019s not actually me - I\\u2019m not involved with it. So I back out of the closet and into my room. Then, there\\u2019s some other event, but it\\u2019s like the first night of the dream where I know I get up, I don\\u2019t stay in my room, I go and do some other things\\u2026 but they turn into a blur. So I\\u2019m involved in this other event. Then I come back into the room and it\\u2019s night time again. My ex-husband is gone. I feel that thing that was outside of the window is now in the closet. But since I know that it kind of belongs to my ex-husband it\\u2019s not really there to scare me, I feel less frightened about it\\u2019s unknownness. So I try to get into my bed. This is pointless. I know there\\u2019s something in the closet. So I get up and again I creep over to the closet and I open the door a crack. I\\u2019m slightly afraid of what I\\u2019m going to see, but much less than the very first night. I open it up and there\\u2019s someone sitting in there. I don\\u2019t know who it is - it\\u2019s a stranger - and it\\u2019s not talking to me. It\\u2019s just sitting there. I stand there for a little while, unsure. Do I want to interact with it? But now I\\u2019ve opened the closet door, so what am I going to do now? It stands up and it\\u2019s a man. The stranger. Then the room shifts, it deconstructs and it\\u2019s not the bedroom with the gabled windows anymore. I\\u2019m in the front hall of a house, maybe it\\u2019s the main floor of this one because I had been on the upper floor in the bedroom. Then I\\u2019m involved with this other kind of transaction. Now the front door is opening and there\\u2019s someone on the other side of the door. A barter is going on. I\\u2019ve lost the rest of the dream.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Murder\\u201d I\\u2019m in an outdoor space. It\\u2019s nighttime. There are seven or eight really long, long tables set up one after the other after the other, making a long row of tables. People are gathered around the tables; some are sitting, some are standing. I\\u2019m at the second table from the back. There is a series of movements that people have to execute and they\\u2019re being judged and marked. The people who are doing the judging and marking are friendly and conversational. They go from table to table making small talk. Then they ask people: \\u201cAre you ready then?\\u201d The people respond, \\u201cyes\\u201d or \\u201cno, not quite.\\u201d So if they say yes, they go up to a space that\\u2019s around the front table and do the movements. Then basically they clear out after that. But not everyone is leaving; there\\u2019s still a lot of friendly chit-chat going on along the sides of the table. I\\u2019ve noticed that the wave of people getting up and finishing is getting closer to my table. I tell the people that I\\u2019m sitting with that it\\u2019s almost our time and maybe we should rehearse. So we do. One of the people is a spotter and holds out an arm. You have to somersault overtop the arm and land on your feet. Then the third person pierces cartilage that runs down the side of our neck, like an aquatic gill, with an instrument. It has to be done at exactly the right spot, or it will hurt. If you put it in the right spot, it won\\u2019t hurt. This also has to be done quickly. This is why some people are missing or doing the somersault improperly so they don\\u2019t land in the right place and straighten up in the right place in order to have this piercing. So it\\u2019s our turn now. The person who is judging this does come around and says: \\u201cAre you ready?\\u201d We say yes. I\\u2019m doing the somersault. There\\u2019s a taller woman doing the holding out of the arm. Then I\\u2019m also doing the piercing. So we go up to the clearing in front of the table. I\\u2019m about to do the somersault when there\\u2019s a commotion at the back. I see this couple that I noticed earlier when we were practicing in the arena. The woman is very tiny. She has short, closed-cropped dark hair. Her partner is a lot taller than she is. They look very similar and I think they might be brother and sister. I realize that when they were practicing, they had this intimacy of movement, almost like there was no separation of being. I remember noticing them before during the practice - they were skating and doing this beautifully connected intimate dance. I was marveling at how smooth it was. The commotion is that she has murdered her partner or her brother. She\\u2019s really upset. Now the people that are responsible for this event are investigating. So the group I\\u2019m with has to return to our table - we weren\\u2019t able to execute our somersault and piercing. We go back to the table and are sitting there awaiting instruction. Of the ongoing investigation, the accusation is floating around that the woman deliberately killed her male partner. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cThat can\\u2019t be right! How could it go from that beautiful and connected with the love that they shared change in that short period of time?\\u201d The investigation continues and there\\u2019s some talk between people. I can hear the people who were involved in the investigation reporting to each other. They are compiling a report. At first it seems like they\\u2019re gathering and will arrest her and take her away. She\\u2019s not actively sobbing, but she looks like she\\u2019s sobbing - her body posture looks like it\\u2019s sobbing but there is no sound coming out of her mouth and there are no tears coming out of her eyes. Suddenly someone else comes in with a question - they found something that discredits the conclusion that she murdered him and starts to report that it was an accident. Then the panic starts to settle down in the group. Some friends or family that she has are approaching her and taking her away with them. The kerfuffle starts to die down and it comes back to us that our turn is still next. We follow the crew of judges up to the area, properly execute the somersault and then I pierce the cartilage gill where I was supposed to, and we\\u2019re finished.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Night Walk\\u201d This dream starts in a house that\\u2019s mine. It\\u2019s a different kind of house - open concept. It\\u2019s two levels. There is a lot of space in the rooms. There aren\\u2019t a lot of contents in each room. I cook something for supper. It\\u2019s some kind of pasta with weird sauce. There\\u2019s this piece of chicken with breading on it. My conscious mind is thinking, \\u201cEw, I never make food like that.\\u201d The pasta is kind of dry and so is the chicken. I don\\u2019t make things with breading. I eat a little bit of supper and don\\u2019t really like it. I take about three bites and leave it. I tell my child - the child is a mixture of my son and daughter at the same time - we\\u2019re going to go for a walk after supper. It needs to be dark, so we are waiting until it gets dark. We leave out the house. I had something in my hand. The walk is down a path. We go out first through a field and then through an opening in some rocks which we go underneath. Then there is a fork and I say we need to take the path on the left. We climb up a steep ascent and navigate that. Then there\\u2019s a ridge to follow along. There\\u2019s a vista here before we climb up. Suddenly it zooms out and you can see how vast this landscape is - it\\u2019s like an escarpment and really quite beautiful. Then it zooms back in and we\\u2019re standing there. It\\u2019s a long hike. So we hike for probably half the night. I have this feeling in my body where it\\u2019s a tiny bit scary. But I have my child with me and I don\\u2019t want to communicate my own fear to my child. So I do quite well at appearing brave and courageous. The landscape is very pretty even in the night. There\\u2019s a feeling of lush. It feels Canadian with a mix of evergreen, deciduous trees. It\\u2019s cool, but not too cold or too hot. I can feel the packed dirt underneath my feet. It\\u2019s not too overgrown. It\\u2019s not a very wide path, so some of the grasses have grown into it. But you can still see the path ahead, so we aren\\u2019t night blind. There is enough light from the moon and the stars that we can see the path. So we hike and we get tired and our legs start to get a little bit sore. I say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s turn around and go back now.\\u201d So we do. We navigate exactly backwards. It\\u2019s uneventful. Nothing comes after us. There\\u2019s no need to run or hasten our pace. We arrive back at the house and I realize that whatever I had in my hand, I left there. So, my child sleeps, but I don\\u2019t. I leave the house and I meet someone else at a marina - it\\u2019s a complex of houses where people live. I\\u2019m meeting some friends there. There are lawn chairs set up in a circle. It\\u2019s an uncomfortable baby shower where people sit around in a circle talking stiffly in awkward small talk. There\\u2019s some kind of party game going on. One of the people grabs me by the hands and pulls me into the middle of the circle. I\\u2019m to stand there and grab the hands of two other people, then we lean back until there\\u2019s tension in the arms. Then that\\u2019s it. We stand back upright, let go, go back into our chairs. I wait and watch a few other people do the same kind of party trick. Then I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhen is this thing going to be over?\\u201d One by one, people start to leave. I don\\u2019t linger. Then I\\u2019m caught by one of the people I know. She says, \\u201cCome on, we have to go visit my mom. She\\u2019s in one of these houses.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll do that.\\u201d As we enter into the house, I realize it\\u2019s another baby shower of some sort. There are bits of blue decoration - like the tissue paper kind - and blue balloons stuck to the wall. Finger foods have been set out everywhere. The mom stands up when she sees me, but then she tips over to one side. I realize that she\\u2019s had way too much to drink. In fact, she seems to have had more to drink than she seems to be aware of. She doesn\\u2019t seem to realize she\\u2019s staggering and banging into furniture. I feel compassion for her. I also hope she\\u2019ll sit down. She does. She still has this loopy unchanging happy smile on her face throughout this. It\\u2019s an unwavering expression. The rest of the people aren\\u2019t really engaging with each other. I get up and slowly back away out of the room and out the front door. I leave and go back to my house. I\\u2019m walking. It\\u2019s a fairly long walk and by the time I get there, it\\u2019s morning. My child wakes up. There\\u2019s this same dried pasta with a piece of chicken still in the pot. It\\u2019s in the exact same condition as it was the night before. Now it\\u2019s nighttime again. I tell my child that I forgot something on the walk and we need to do it again. Only this time, there\\u2019s not that same little bit of adrenaline going through my body where I feel slightly scared. We go through exactly the same steps to go on the walk. It\\u2019s dark, it\\u2019s at night. I wake up before I retrieve whatever it is that I left there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Nothing\\u201d It seems to me that my apathy and feeling of not belonging, not being able to play anywhere, or seeing that my skills are not needed or wanted anywhere has soaked into my dream...All it was is a dry, hot African steppe. There was nothing in it, no activity. Just a steppe.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Passageway\\u201d The property we have is like a winery in the sense that there are wild grape leaves growing everywhere. It\\u2019s old. The house is made of stone. There\\u2019s a lot of land. We don\\u2019t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it\\u2019s sustenance farming. We don\\u2019t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren\\u2019t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I\\u2019m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it\\u2019s not one big cohesive unit, it\\u2019s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn\\u2019t know were there. I\\u2019m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it\\u2019s not heated. My dad tells me that we have to go and take stock of what\\u2019s in the basement because he has to list the house for sale. My brother and I go down there. The basement is super creepy. There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There\\u2019s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I\\u2019m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there\\u2019s a passageway that leads off. It\\u2019s like a crawlspace and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going in there. I turn around and my brother is gone. I can see his torch light and he\\u2019s in there looking around. How can he do that?! He\\u2019s in it for about ten minutes. I\\u2019m not freaking out, I know he\\u2019s okay. Nothing bad has ever happened to us in this place. I trust it, it\\u2019s just creepy. I don\\u2019t like all the slimy scuttling things and I don\\u2019t want them in my hair. I\\u2019m on edge. He pops out and I say, \\u201cWhat did you find?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what he says. This isn\\u2019t the first time he\\u2019s been in there and he was checking on what he had in there. He says it\\u2019s good. Then we go back up the stairs which are really rickety, and up into the kitchen. There\\u2019s a dug out place beside the kitchen; it\\u2019s just dirt with big stones. My dad is standing there and he says, \\u201cAlright, let\\u2019s go take stock of what\\u2019s in the barn.\\u201d My brother and I still have our torches in our hands but we put them out when we came up the stairs. The torches are all made of wax and now they\\u2019re shorter with more wax drippings on the outside because of the time we spent in the basement. We go out the side opening. There aren\\u2019t any doors, just openings. The kitchen does have glass on the windows. We go over a meadow into this other place. The stones are piled up. They\\u2019ve been chipped away into roughly big square shapes and stacked on top of each other, sawed and stuffed into the cracks to keep the weather out. Grass and bits of organic matter and seeds have grown in the sod. This is what the whole thing is made of, every structure. Now we go into the structure my dad calls the barn. It has a side entrance made of this sod packed stone. We go in there. The whole thing is one big open space which is why my dad called it the barn, except we never had any animals. There had been animals at some other point. We look around. Again, we take our torches. But the torch in this structure has never been lit. My dad has the lit torch. When we get in there, my brother and I put ours on his. Mine won\\u2019t light. My brother\\u2019s did. I\\u2019m calling to them, \\u201cWait, wait, my torch isn't lit!\\u201d He comes back. Mine is being really stubborn and takes a little while to light. It does but it's very dim, it\\u2019s like it\\u2019s wet and it won\\u2019t stay going very well. I\\u2019m not doing anything except trying to keep up with them. There\\u2019s nothing in there. There\\u2019s a place we didn\\u2019t explore, it\\u2019s another passageway off the barn. My dad turns around and says, \\u201cOkay that\\u2019s good.\\u201d I say, \\u201cAre you sure? Because there\\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. We need to organize this so that when the real estate agent comes, we have all the categories of all the places on this property written down and they\\u2019re evaluated separately or we won\\u2019t get the value we deserve.\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care. I just want to sell it.\\u201d I think he makes some comment about his age and says it doesn\\u2019t matter due to his age. I\\u2019m arguing with him and say, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s precisely why you should get out of this property what you deserve. You\\u2019re not working anymore. This is what you have to support you through your age.\\u201d Now he\\u2019s thoughtful. He just doesn\\u2019t feel like doing it. My brother and I decide to finish it on our own. We leave the barn with my dad and walk around the outside. I see that there are so many different kinds of fruit growing around - wild cherries, peaches, quinces, pears and apples. I wish I had time to gather these and preserve them. Now we\\u2019re back in the kitchen and have a little bit to eat, just some bread and a wheel of cheese. I don\\u2019t eat any of it though, I just give it to my dad and brother. Some others who are part of our extended family come to the table that is handmade out of wood. There standing there. Some of them have fruit in their hands and are eating as they gather around. This is where I identify my daughter and her ex-boyfriend. I say, \\u201cWe need to go back down into the basement and take more stock of what\\u2019s there.\\u201d We do this. My brother spends a lot more time in that one passageway. He\\u2019s growing something in it. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to move that though. Whatever it is, you need to move it before the real estate agent comes.\\u201d He says, \\u201cYes, I know.\\u201d Then he gets thoughtful and I can tell he\\u2019s thinking where he\\u2019s going to move it. He says, \\u201cMaybe I\\u2019ll just move it further back because no one is going to go in there.\\u201d I think he\\u2019s right. I worry about him because no one knows how far it goes. No one has gone far back including him. This makes me feel on edge again. Now we exit the side building. The real estate agent and lawyers will be here shortly. No one has gone through the barn yet. My brother, daughter, her ex-boyfriend and I light our torches and go into the barn. Mine is doing the same thing where it won\\u2019t stay lit but the barn is brighter because there are now four torches. I see the passage at one end actually connects to the house, but instead of going underground, it goes above ground and I find it odd that we haven\\u2019t noticed this before. The odd thing is that even though there\\u2019s nothing there and the barn is a lot dryer and there are no creepy crawlies and webs and spiders and night living things the way the basement had, I always feel a presence at my back like beings you can\\u2019t see that are in there. It\\u2019s thick with them and I can feel it. We go through the bends of the passage and we end up behind the house. I say, \\u201cInstead of entering the house through the side, my dad\\u2019s probably in there with legal people, we should go underneath so we\\u2019re quiet and don\\u2019t interrupt them.\\u201d We agree to do this, but the passage takes us into where they are. We\\u2019re sneaking around trying to be really quiet and all of a sudden my dad and the lawyers see us and we all start laughing. I say, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t think you would be here. We were deliberately trying to be quiet so we wouldn't interrupt you.\\u201d My dad remarks, \\u201cWell you never know where the passages in this house are going to lead.\\u201d Everybody thinks this is funny so it takes some of the tension off. However, I can\\u2019t shake the feeling that there are other people living in this house who we haven\\u2019t found. As I\\u2019m saying this, I look up and see the glow of a torch from inside the wall and it\\u2019s way up high in the place between the room off the kitchen and the kitchen, it\\u2019s in that wall. The wild cherry vines had covered it up but the cherries have gotten really ripe and they\\u2019re falling off because they\\u2019re so heavy and ripe, so I can see this crack in the stone. I get my dad to lift me up. I\\u2019m heavy, an adult size, so I can feel his arms shaking. He can\\u2019t hold me up for very long. I got a glimpse of people in there! There\\u2019s a dad and a mom. He puts me down. I say, \\u201cYou need to lift me up again. I saw a man with a hat on.\\u201d Someone else lifts me up and this time the arms are steadier. I see a baby strapped onto the mom\\u2019s chest and a young boy the age of nine who has covered his face with the same kind of pointy hat his dad has. I notice the mom has one of those hats, too, but the point of hers is tipped over to the side. There\\u2019s a whole room we didn\\u2019t know about and they live in this room. He puts me down and I say, \\u201cWe need to find the passageway that leads there to tell them the house is being sold.\\u201d I think the buyer is going to tear it all down and I\\u2019m worried about this family. We go through the passage again only this time we\\u2019re looking at the walls trying to find cracks. I know where this should be directionally. But once we\\u2019re in the passageway, it\\u2019s hard to keep your sense of direction. We\\u2019re in the barn again and I feel the presence. I turn around and this time it startles me and there\\u2019s the man with the hat and veil over his face. I say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the man from the room in the wall.\\u201d He says yes and I share with him that it\\u2019s going to be sold and I think it\\u2019s going to be torn down. He says he has nowhere else to go with his family. My brother says, \\u201cWell there is somewhere else.\\u201d He indicates the passageway where he has been growing things. The man says, \\u201cOh we\\u2019ve come from there and I don\\u2019t know if I want to go back there with my wife and kids. I\\u2019ve considered it but my wife wants to stay where we are and take our chances.\\u201d The dream ends with us having this conversation of where there is to go after there and the sadness that someone would even think about tearing down this magical place that holds so much history. We\\u2019ve lived there and survived. The water is pumped from the ground with the handle. We have torches. We don\\u2019t need the electricity. We\\u2019ve been able to survive on the fruit around the house. I don\\u2019t want to leave and neither does the man with his family.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Photo Chest\\u201d I\\u2019m walking across a really long bridge. It feels a little bit cold and windy and as though I\\u2019m walking against the wind and uphill. The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that\\u2019s been empty for a few years. It\\u2019s where my daughter\\u2019s grandparents used to live. They\\u2019ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter\\u2019s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It\\u2019s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It\\u2019s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There\\u2019s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There\\u2019s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It\\u2019s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There\\u2019s one point where I\\u2019m a little bit surprised at Roberta\\u2019s description. They aren\\u2019t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter\\u2019s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There\\u2019s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it\\u2019s her because her face doesn\\u2019t really change. She\\u2019s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I\\u2019d never heard of this woman before. I\\u2019m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn\\u2019t aware of. We just pass the day looking through all these generations of mostly women in the photographs. It was lovely.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Plant Hanger\\u201d It\\u2019s something like a conference, but more like a festival. I don\\u2019t know many people in it and I feel lost. I\\u2019m grateful to see that my sister-in-law is there, so we group together. She accompanies me as I move from place to place among the throngs of people. When it\\u2019s over, we stop somewhere and pick up some kind of plant. Then, I meet my friend, Michelle. She invites me back to her apartment. But my sister-in-law doesn\\u2019t come. She says she has somewhere else to go. The apartment is located on the upper floor, above a store. It\\u2019s on a very busy street in a city. I\\u2019ve been in this city before in a dream - this is the street where I saw my grandmother coming out of one of the shops. We go up the stairs to the side of the shop entrance and down a very small hall into her apartment. The kitchen is off to the left, the living/dining room is straight ahead, like an L-shaped room around the kitchen, and off to the left is the bathroom and two bedrooms. We sit down on the couch in the living room for a few moments. Her young son is there. I\\u2019ve never seen him in person before. I\\u2019m watching him play. Then, Michelle says to me: would I take a look at her plant window and help her to move all the plants in front of that window and get them hung in that place because they\\u2019re dying. So we go down to the bedroom and she shows me the window. The light that is shining through is radiant and it dazzles my eyes. I can\\u2019t even look at the window because the light is so bright. So I stand to the side of it and turn my head toward it and look that way. I see that there\\u2019s actually a sheer curtain hanging from a rod in front of the window. I didn\\u2019t notice it before because the light coming through was so dazzling. There are two plants hanging from the curtain rod. The ceiling is really high. While I\\u2019m looking at this and strategizing and thinking, hmm, how are we going to do this, she comes in and has this big vase, about 2 feet long and with mosaic on it. The colors are brilliant, mostly purple with some black, but the paint is peeling. She said: \\u201cI wonder about putting this in here, too.\\u201d As soon as she sets it down, there's some kind of reaction with the light coming through the window. All of a sudden you can see a whole lot more detail in the painting on it. But because the light is so brilliant, you can\\u2019t tell it was cracked before. I say, \\u201cOh yes, definitely bring that in here and put it in front of the window.\\u201d As she did that, everything else in the room lit up with an internal radiance of its own. So I say to her: \\u201cThat is one really high ceiling and I can\\u2019t imagine your husband having to put 16 plant hooks in the ceiling. Do you even have a ladder? So it might be better to just put 2 hooks in and we\\u2019ll hang 2 wooden dowels across, then hang the plants from those. We can stagger them. I\\u2019ve done this before in my own place.\\u201d So she agrees, then needs to go back to tend her son. So I take some measurements. Now I have in my bag, big spools of twine that I\\u2019m going to cut and start weaving into plant hangers, like macrame. So I go back out into the living room after taking the measurements and she says: \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have tea first? I\\u2019ve made some homemade cookies.\\u201d I do that and again we\\u2019re watching her son play. We can't really have a conversation because every time we start one, her son comes up with a toy and starts talking and suspends the conversation. Then she asks if I\\u2019ll watch him while she goes into the washroom. I say, \\u201cSure.\\u201d So I\\u2019m talking to him and lying on the floor. He\\u2019s moving trucks around or something. He hands me this toy and I notice that it\\u2019s got a plunger on the inside that you pull out then push - like a big plastic version of a gun. It was red and yellow with all these other floating pieces of color on the inside. I accidentally push the plunger and it squirts him in the eye with water. He lies down on the floor as though I\\u2019ve hit him. I understand that I\\u2019ve accidentally started playing with him with this squirt thing and I didn\\u2019t mean to squirt water in their house. So I get up and put it on the counter in the kitchen. While I\\u2019m doing this, Michelle comes out of the bathroom and she picks her son up and puts him on her hip and follows me into the kitchen. She\\u2019s doing something with one hand while she\\u2019s holding him with the other. I notice that there\\u2019s so much noise. I look over and see that there\\u2019s two televisions on and they\\u2019re both playing something different. I ask her if I can turn one of them off. She says yes, so I do. Then she says, \\u201cWhile you\\u2019re there, turn the other one off, too.\\u201d I look at it and don\\u2019t understand how. There\\u2019s a labyrinth of buttons and I don't see anything that\\u2019s obvious with a power switch. She says it\\u2019s the fourth one down from the top. So I push it, but the buttons are really small and my fingers are big. I accidentally push the second button first, and the television reacts and some other things happen simultaneously. She sighs, exasperatedly and comes over and turns it off herself. She sets her son down on the floor in the living room again with the toys, and says, \\u201cI need to go back in the bathroom again.\\u201d So I sit down with him. While I\\u2019m doing this, her husband comes in. I\\u2019ve never met him before. He\\u2019s surprised to see me. He sets down his suitcases, then asks if I know where the cookies are. I say, \\u201cYes, they\\u2019re in the kitchen.\\u201d So he goes in there. His son is still playing, but now he\\u2019s making utterances and they\\u2019re really deep. I notice that he has a really deep voice. I\\u2019m trying to decipher what he\\u2019s saying. Now the dad is in the kitchen and he\\u2019s talking. I can\\u2019t understand what he\\u2019s saying, but I notice that his voice is deep, too, and think to myself: \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s where the son gets his deep voice from.\\u201d Then Michelle comes out of the bathroom and she goes into the kitchen to talk to her husband and says something about there being three different kinds of cookies. She\\u2019s trying to get him to take one certain kind, but he\\u2019s ignoring her and piling up a plate of three different kinds and starts to eat them. Now I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable because I\\u2019m in their family dynamic and I don\\u2019t wish to be. I just want to make the macrame hangers for the plants. That\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Pool\\u201d I\\u2019m in a building that is several stories high. I never go outside of the building. I can just sense that I'm that far off the ground. There\\u2019s a lot of light coming in through windows in the ceiling; there aren\\u2019t any windows on the sides. Sometimes the light is so bright it hurts my eyes. At other times it\\u2019s just a presence. There are two pools in the building and they\\u2019re separated by a wall. They aren\\u2019t artificial pools. They look like natural pools insofar as if no one is in the water, the organic material will settle down to the bottom and you\\u2019ll be able to see it through the water. One of the pools is more often this way. The other one is muddy and the water does not look appealing to swim in at all. There is an army of guards surrounding both pools. They are vicious, mean, and I feel like they are alien as well. They are heartless, robotic. They\\u2019re in charge of us. They make judgments against us. Then they force us into the pools where depending on how we react, determines whether we will live or die. I see Debra and Omar. Both Debra and I are concerned about Omar as he seems to be getting the brunt of much maltreatment by these robotic guards. They\\u2019re pushing him around and poking him with things and they\\u2019re telling him he has this long list of wrongdoings. He\\u2019s going to be forced into the pool and killed. In fact, we know he is going to die this particular day. He has prepared for it in some way. Now there\\u2019s a little antechamber off the pools. We are sitting there talking to him. He\\u2019s telling us of his regrets. He\\u2019s also saying he\\u2019s in full knowledge of these and he\\u2019s voluntarily allowing them to treat him this way. He\\u2019s also explaining to us that going into the pool is part of the process and going voluntarily will make it better for him. So, this eases some of our tension and anxiety and sadness. Then it\\u2019s time for us all to leave the antechamber so we do. We go back out to the area around the pools. I notice that Omar has got metal boots - they look like the kind of boots that Roman soldiers would have worn. Now he\\u2019s also wearing the metal armor that they would have worn as well. Yet, he\\u2019s going to jump into the crystalline pool and I\\u2019m thinking that\\u2019s a really bad idea because it\\u2019s going to make him heavy; he\\u2019ll sink down to the bottom and then disturb all the dirt and organic material and it will turn into mud, and then they will judge him harshly. He does it anyway. I can feel the robotic guards start to surround us. One of them pushes me with their bayonet. I am forced into the pool as well. I\\u2019m trying not to move because I don\\u2019t want to stir up any of the silt from the bottom. Actually both of us do a really good job at keeping the pool water crystal clear. I swim to the end where it\\u2019s deeper. I find an opening where the people are not being treated as harshly and I get out and join them. Omar, however, is still in the pool. I'm not sure if he is going to be able to find an opening to get out. The guards are still really thick there and there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any escaping. The person beside me when I\\u2019m getting out says she\\u2019s been there for a really long time. Her hands are behind her back. They look like they\\u2019re tied, but I don\\u2019t think they are - I think she\\u2019s just standing like that. It makes it look as though we\\u2019re captives but really we\\u2019re starting to move more freely. So I do the same thing. I put my wrists together at the back of my body. I\\u2019m moving with the crowd. I\\u2019m slipping into the opening between the pools and I walk around the outside, allowing myself to be jostled by the people being pushed. But I\\u2019m actually not being pushed. I\\u2019m moving in and around the crowd. The constant moving is avoiding us being pushed to our deaths. This carries on for quite some time. I\\u2019m still looking to see if Omar is alive in the pool and he is. I can feel his life force starting to slip away and change into something else. I\\u2019m not hopeful that I will see him again alive and outside of the pool.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Professor\\u2019s Car\\u201d This dream begins and I have my friend's daughter with my extended family on vacation. She has a few special needs and I am caring for her. She\\u2019s a really sweet, innocent child. She is innocent to the extent that she will trust anyone. We go to a number of places on a roadtrip - it lasts a week. I feel like we might be somewhere on the Eastern seaboard of the states by the temperate climate and the vegetation and trees, as well as the hills. It is quite beautiful. We visit some scenic places as well as some historical places. My friend\\u2019s daughter is a pleasure to be with and explore with. My family begins to find an affection for her. At some time, both of my ears become sore and infected. I can\\u2019t hear anyone. I\\u2019m sleepy and I\\u2019m not feeling well. For the past two days of the vacation, I can\\u2019t wake up and I stay in the travel van. At one point I wake up and my stepmother has put cotton in my ears and I wasn\\u2019t even aware of it. Then when we get back to where we\\u2019re staying I still sleep. They ask if I\\u2019m okay. I say, \\u201cYes, I think I just need to sleep.\\u201d The vacation is over and now I return my friend\\u2019s daughter to him. When we get back to his place, he\\u2019s cleaned his apartment from top to bottom. He\\u2019s planted some beautiful plants in his bathroom - some look like cattails and bulrushes that are growing up from something in the floor around the toilet. The bicycles are all moved from the kitchen. I note that one of the bicycles is worth thousands of dollars. It\\u2019s got something for someone to sit on on the back of it, but the construction and design of it is so heavy that it takes two people to pedal it. So there is that provision. Where the bicycle chain and gears would be, there is a case overtop of it - to protect the inside of the legs of whoever is pedaling it. Then there\\u2019s another one of a different design, less expensive, more sporty for his son. So he says, \\u201cWould you mind waiting here just a little bit longer while I take these down to my garage space?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, sure.\\u201d So his daughter gets settled in her room and she\\u2019s happy to be home. She also doesn\\u2019t want me to leave. I tell her that I\\u2019ll see her again. My friend comes back up from putting the bicycles away and asks if I would like to see the car he has. I say, \\u201cI thought you didn\\u2019t have a car.\\u201d He said, \\u201cWell I did, I just couldn\\u2019t find it. But now that I\\u2019ve cleaned, I\\u2019ve got space for it and the bicycles.\\u201d I say sure. So he\\u2019s already removed it from the garage. The son stays with the daughter and my friend takes just me out for a ride. He says, \\u201cI thought you would enjoy this. I wanted to thank you for taking care of her for the week.\\u201d The car on the outside is a mint green. I notice the car\\u2019s age. It must be from the 1970s. It\\u2019s a Ford Metro. We get in and there\\u2019s chrome and teak on the inside. He presses a button and the dash expands upwards. It\\u2019s just beautiful. Everything is made of wood - the dashboard, it wraps around the driver\\u2019s side, the passenger\\u2019s side, goes all the way to the backseat; it\\u2019s on the inside panels of both doors and looks hand carved. There are these different controls. The steering wheel is a combination of teak and chrome as well. He\\u2019s pressing buttons and starting things. The car starts to take off and it feels like it\\u2019s gliding over the road. I also notice that we\\u2019re going at a fair speed and it\\u2019s not rattling or shaking. I comment to him that it\\u2019s really impressive how it drives. I say, \\u201cHow is it possible that you have a car this old and this good of shape?\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, I hardly ever drive it. It doesn\\u2019t have very much mileage on it.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWow, that\\u2019s really preserved it. This is exceptional.\\u201d We stop at an ice cream place. Here, I stand still. There\\u2019s an outdoor table, like the kind that comes up to your chest. It\\u2019s got a small round dias on the top. I\\u2019m doing something here with my ears. I need to take the packing out, putting it in plastic and throwing it away and replacing it. I have privacy. While I\\u2019m doing this, 2 or 3 young women (not teenagers, maybe early twenties) are grouped around the car and he\\u2019s talking to them. So I linger a little longer over my task. Then they walk off. But he\\u2019s still talking. So he directs what he was saying to me. I catch the last two or three words, but they\\u2019re muffled. He says, \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t listening to anything I was saying, were you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, I am. But I couldn\\u2019t hear what you said first. I was way over there. My ears are really sore and I just can\\u2019t hear. Would you mind repeating it? Is it about the car?\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t and he\\u2019s a bit peeved that I didn\\u2019t listen. So we both go into the store. It\\u2019s just a regular gas station. I don\\u2019t need anything, so just linger around the doorfront. He picks up a few things and we get back into the car. We drive a little further. I\\u2019m asking him about the car. We return to his house. I get out before he parks the car in the underground garage and go back up to the apartment. Then I just give his daughter a hug. By that time my friend has re-entered. He thanks me again and I just say, \\u201cSee you later, \\u201c and leave. Then I walk back from his apartment to the house I\\u2019m temporarily sharing with my extended family. Now, I\\u2019m working in some kind of school, preparing lessons. While I\\u2019m in the building, I notice my friend\\u2019s daughter. She\\u2019s attending the school. I\\u2019m concerned about the treatment she receives from the other teachers. I suspect that one of the other teachers may be harsh with her. I\\u2019m trying to figure out if this is true. I\\u2019m keeping an eye on these things. The other teacher I\\u2019m suspecting is an older woman. She\\u2019s wearing a plain simple dress. She looks like Jane Eyre. At one point, one of the students or an assistant of sorts, is helping my friend\\u2019s daughter in the washroom. When they are finished, I say, \\u201cExcuse me. Do you mind? I just need to talk to you for a second.\\u201d She is acting hedgy and fidgety. She doesn't want to stand too close. I\\u2019m saying to her: \\u201cThis is important. I would appreciate it if you would give me your full attention and stand still.\\u201d So she does for two seconds. Then she starts looking around again. I say, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re uncomfortable with this, we can make an appointment. But I thought we could just talk here for a second and then you can be on your way. Is there somewhere you need to go?\\u201d She says no. I say, \\u201cWell , are you able to stand here for a few minutes?\\u201d I can\\u2019t figure out why she\\u2019s fidgeting. I\\u2019m wondering if she needs to use the washroom. I ask, \\u201cIs there somewhere else you need to go?\\u201d She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m just not supposed to be talking to you.\\u201d I think, \\u201cOh this is weird.\\u201d She is the assistant for the teacher that I think might be being abusive and she\\u2019s been instructed not to talk to me. I think this is significant. Then I tell her about my rank in the school and she needs to sit there and listen to me because I\\u2019m starting to feel like the other teacher has her assistant covering for her. Now I\\u2019m really suspecting that she is as abusive as I think she is. So I pull rank. The student stands still. I read her something and tell her it is part of her job, it is her responsibility and she signed a paper to report any abuses or marks on the students that she sees. If she does not report it immediately, she is also subject to the abuse. So I can see her face as I\\u2019m reading this. Now she is paying attention. Her eyes widen and I think she knows something. So I tell her that I\\u2019m going to be watching her. Then she leaves, looking alarmed. Then my friend\\u2019s daughter is still in the washroom. I go in and check her, but she doesn\\u2019t have any marks on her. I tell her that If anything happens, she is to come see me right away and I\\u2019ll take her home to her dad.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Protective Glasses\\u201d I go back to the same theatre. This time I\\u2019m with my daughter. We\\u2019re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I\\u2019m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There\\u2019s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There\\u2019s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they\\u2019re closing them and stuff, but we\\u2019re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we\\u2019re standing there and we\\u2019re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don\\u2019t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: \\u201cWhat are those glasses you\\u2019re wearing? Are they protective somehow?\\u201d She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHmm, wow, maybe they do work,\\u201d kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there\\u2019s an indoor pool. It\\u2019s the same thing where we\\u2019re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you\\u2019re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it\\u2019s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they\\u2019re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don\\u2019t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can\\u2019t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher\\u2019s attention and say, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my daughter?\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh she\\u2019s in there, she\\u2019s in the pool.\\u201d I go back outside so I\\u2019m behind the glass and I\\u2019m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I\\u2019m scanning the water, there\\u2019s no daughter. I\\u2019m starting to get scared and thinking, \\u201cAre they so busy testing everyone that they\\u2019re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?\\u201d I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to be in here! You can\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for my daughter! She\\u2019s underneath the water. She\\u2019s not surfacing.\\u201d They look and she\\u2019s not in there. Now I\\u2019m really scared, like, \\u201cWhat the heck? Where is she?\\u201d The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She\\u2019s definitely not in the pool. We\\u2019re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I\\u2019m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She\\u2019s coming from the back of the pool. They\\u2019re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?\\u201d She says, \\u201c Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.\\u201d I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I\\u2019m upset with her.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Race\\u201d I\\u2019m in a house with a couple of rooms. The rooms are spacious. There\\u2019s a dining room with some kind of chandelier in the middle of it. There\\u2019s a foyer between the dining room and living room. The foyer has a door that goes to the outside. The living room is also spacious with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The foyer that joins these two rooms is quite large with some furniture in it as well. I\\u2019m with another woman and two men. The other woman and the man have a relationship together. At the beginning of the dream I don\\u2019t know who they are and they\\u2019re off in the shadows. I have a new relationship with the man that I can see. He\\u2019s white and has dark brown hair. I can see his features, they\\u2019re a little angular and pointy. He\\u2019s quite a bit taller than I am and slim. We\\u2019re just getting to know each other. We talk somewhat. I have a feeling I\\u2019ve been set up with him but I don\\u2019t feel any energy with him and he\\u2019s a stranger. We do start talking. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing together really, but we move around the rooms and talk in different areas. I can feel myself starting to warm toward him. He can be interesting. I am starting to like him. The woman and the other man come out of the shadowy part of the dream. The man starts to talk to the man I was with. The woman approaches me and asks if we want to leave to go out for the day. We\\u2019ve both separately agreed that we do. The vehicles are motorcycles. The man I\\u2019m supposed to ride with seems to be recovering from some kind of injury and his buddy is asking him about the injury. He tells him that he thinks it\\u2019s going to be okay. Now I look and see him flexing and extending his leg at the knee. He says, \\u201cSee look, everything seems to be fine.\\u201d So, we put chaps over our legs and put on heavier coats. We go outside, get on the motorcycles and tour around for a little bit, then come back. We come back in. I'm involved in some meal preparation, as is the other woman. The two men are also doing things to help prepare. Then we have a meal on the table. We share the meal, all four of us. The other two recede into the shadowy part of the dream and leave me with the man I was speaking with and riding with all day. Now I can feel the pulse of a growing sexual energy between us. We explore this for a bit. We\\u2019re in the foyer when we\\u2019re doing this. The other man interrupts us and tells my partner that he needs to come out and look out the living room window and see what\\u2019s going on. My partner and I separate. The two men go into the living room. I\\u2019m tidying up and getting dressed. I see that there are a number of vehicles on the other side of the street, different models of Jeep from the more rugged safari type to the SUV type. Each one has a driver that has gotten out and they\\u2019re kind of congregating on the shoulder of the road. I can see also that some of them have been injured. The men are clapping each other on the back warmly like, \\u201cYou did it!\\u201d Others are rotating one shoulder up and back and bending elbows as though the shoulder and elbow have been injured but are now starting to heal. I notice that it\\u2019s a sunny day now whereas previously very little light was coming in the windows and it was semi-dark. This living room is very bright now. We\\u2019ve got a great big long console tv like the kind people would have in the 1960s that sits in a big wooden box. They\\u2019re starting to gather around to watch a big race. Some of the men that are coming in are quite elderly; whereas the man I was sharing energy with is in his forties. It\\u2019s a variety of males. They\\u2019re finding seats in this giant living room on the couches lining the walls. They\\u2019re setting up to watch this race together and it seems to be a really big event. I\\u2019m not interested in it, but I am interested in what\\u2019s going on in the backyard. I walk out. The living room exits into a greenhouse, like a sunroom, which then exits out into the backyard. I realize I\\u2019m in my grandparents\\u2019 house on the north shore and I have been all along. I\\u2019m looking for the rose bushes. All the gardens are only at the beginning with shoots, like the beginning of spring after a long winter. I\\u2019m just going from garden to garden to see what\\u2019s coming up. I go back into the house. I see the woman\\u2019s features now and it\\u2019s my stepmother. I tell her that there are some things coming up in the garden. She then just recedes into the kitchen. I check on the men in the living room and they\\u2019re still watching the NASCAR races. Then I notice that someone recently has cut roses and put them in vases in the sunroom. The roses are this deep pinkish red in the middle with light green petals around the outside. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat an unusual rose,\\u201d and I wonder who cut them and from which bush. I go back outside. Now it\\u2019s like the beginning of summer and everything has bloomed. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and I look down the length of the lawn. I can see the top of the boathouse and it has grass on it. I want to go lie there because I want to feel the waves and hear them under my body and soak up the sun. I go around to the side of the house first to see if the red and green roses came from there. No rose bushes there. There\\u2019s some kind of gardening shelf, just a little bench made of painted white wicker, with a small cupboard underneath. I open it up to see if I can find gardening tools. Somebody has already opened it and there\\u2019s a pair of gardening gloves and some shears and a couple containers sitting on the top of the bench. I wonder who has been wearing them and if it\\u2019s the person who has been cutting the roses and putting them around the house. I go a little farther and see that one of the plants is a Rose of Sharon but it\\u2019s not in bud yet. Then I decide to stop looking around the other side of the house and walk down the length of the lawn to lie in the sun for a little while. Then I can hear people talking, the doors opening, and people starting to leave. I know the race is over. I stand up and walk back towards the little bench to see if the gloves and shears are still there. I\\u2019m going to try and find some roses because I want to put some in my own room. My stepmother comes out and says, \\u201cYou really like it here, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s beautiful. Can we stay for a while?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think so.\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good. There\\u2019s so much space. It\\u2019s nice not to have to squish myself into a room or turn my body sideways to get into a closet or out of a door.\\u201d She agrees. I say, \\u201cEven if I had a brand new house, they only make the bedrooms nine by nine now. I really like having a big bedroom.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, we can stay for a little while.\\u201d Then she recedes again. I go back into the living room. My friend and his friend are the only ones that remain. His friend asks him to come out for another motorcycle ride. My friend asks if I\\u2019d like to come and I say, \\u201cYeah, I would.\\u201d We get our motorcycle clothing back on and get on the bikes.\\u201d We\\u2019re driving down the highway. It goes around a bend and something I\\u2019m carrying, I think it\\u2019s a roll with a change of clothes in it, flies off the bike and I can see it beside the road. We don\\u2019t stop until we come to an outdoor cafe. I can feel that my right eye has tears in it that have been running down my face, but my left eye is dry. The friend of my friend says, \\u201cI wondered if you were ever going to express any of your grief. I can\\u2019t believe you haven\\u2019t done it until now.\\u201d I tell him that I was, he just couldn\\u2019t see it. He says, \\u201cHmm,\\u201d as though he doesn\\u2019t believe me, and then says, \\u201cWe should go back to the corner and get what you lost.\\u201d I agree and let them take me there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Reunion\\u201d I\\u2019m invited to some kind of gathering, I don\\u2019t know what the purpose is, except that I feel I should go. I have a little hesitancy about this because it\\u2019s enough of a drive for me that I\\u2019m thinking that by the time I get there, I\\u2019m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I\\u2019m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there\\u2019s a bottle of wine - there\\u2019s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I\\u2019ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I\\u2019ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don\\u2019t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there\\u2019s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar\\u2019s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He\\u2019s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, \\u201cit\\u2019s been a long time.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes it has.\\u201d We sit down next to each other and we\\u2019re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we\\u2019re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I\\u2019m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don\\u2019t know. So I\\u2019m not very happy about this. She\\u2019s apparently acting as though she\\u2019s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She\\u2019s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there\\u2019s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven\\u2019t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself from the table and go find my bags and give them to the hostess. When I get back from doing that though, more people have left their seats. I\\u2019m kind of relieved. I didn\\u2019t eat very much, but at least I\\u2019m not stranded in this awkward and ingenuous conversation with the woman. I realize that there\\u2019s been a gift for each of the people at their seats. They didn\\u2019t even notice it. The hostess is a little bit distressed about this - the fact that no one brought anything with them and that no one has noticed that there\\u2019s gifts at the table for each of them, and furthermore that people came and brought their toddlers and kids and left them unsupervised running all over the house. Basically what\\u2019s happened is the guests have been quite oblivious as guests and taken way more latitude than was offered and the house is trashed. Everything is everywhere. The guests have all left. They haven\\u2019t even taken their plates from the table. It\\u2019s just a mess. So I just start cleaning up. I\\u2019m helping by clearing the table and doing dishes. I make a point of thanking the hostess for my gift, which is a pair of silver candleholders that are like the Kokopeli character and they look like they were fashioned in Mexico. I thank her for her thoughtfulness. There\\u2019s also a gingerbread kit where the pieces of gingerbread are wrapped up in saran wrap. You would make your own icing and put them together. It\\u2019s a little mini house. As I\\u2019m thanking her, she\\u2019s enough upset that no one else did, that my words kind of fall around her like they\\u2019re unprocessed by her. She goes down into the basement. I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing down there. I am still cleaning upstairs. I continue helping with the dishes. There are a couple other of her family members - her two kids are helping. The dishes basically get done, but it takes a little while. I go into another room where the toddlers have trashed it. Omar is there. We gaze at each other. I feel his eyes. He beckons to me. He wants me to lie down with him. I say, \\u201cNo, I can\\u2019t do that. There are people and toddlers and stuff here.\\u201d We go upstairs. He\\u2019s cleaning, too, that\\u2019s what he was doing in the other room. We go upstairs and these kids have taken all the clothes out of the dresser. As I\\u2019m picking and folding clothes up, there\\u2019s a dirty diaper on the floor. We are tidying all of this up and trying to make their house right.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Road Trip\\u201d This dream begins with me in a car. My lover is in the backseat and a mutual friend is driving. We\\u2019re about to embark on a road trip. We drive by my kids\\u2019 school first. I want to check and make sure that they both leave and are on their way home to where they will be taken care of. So as we drive by, first I see my son. I wave to him. He waves back and walks in the direction of home. I know he\\u2019ll be fine. Then I see a whole lot of other kids - you know how kids at dismissal time come out in a pack, there may be a few stragglers at first and a few stragglers after the bulk of kids leaving. So we drive slowly. The bulk of kids is gone. I say, \\u201cHang on, I haven\\u2019t seen my daughter yet.\\u201d A few more kids come out of the school, then I see her. I wave and she waves me over. So I get out of the car and walk over right to her. She says, \\u201cMom, I have something you\\u2019ll need.\\u201d She hands me this really long sanitary napkin that has a tail at each end. She says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to need this.\\u201d Then I realize I do need it. But I don't know how to attach it to my body. I go into the school bathroom and I put it inside my underwear. But these tails are so long and I\\u2019m trying to fold them in so they don\\u2019t stick out. I\\u2019m worried it\\u2019s going to travel. It feels uncomfortable and bulky between my legs, and I don\\u2019t like it. However, it needs to collect blood and I feel myself bleeding. I walk back out thes school, give her a hug and she goes in the same direction as my son. I get into the car. Now I\\u2019m uncomfortable and some of the excitement of the road trip has been replaced by the anxiety of this uncomfortable, bulky and insecure thing between my legs. However, I continue on down through the road. The scenery is flat. You can see a lot - miles and miles of flat. There\\u2019s a little bit of steppe at the horizon. We drive for a long period of time until we run out of gas. We pull into a gas station. While my friends are tending to the car, I go into the washroom. I check to make sure that this napkin is still where it\\u2019s supposed to be and it is. I\\u2019m still concerned about these tails. Now I\\u2019m wearing overalls and the back part goes way down past my waist. I look in the mirror and I can see the top bit of my underwear sticking up. I think to myself,\\u201dWow, my underwear is really high today. Or is this going down really low?\\u201d I\\u2019m not really minding that, except that I\\u2019m worried about these tails. So I reach in behind and I tuck them down in again and I want to make sure that no one can see them. I get back into the car and we are driving again. The flat landscape starts to turn into what looks like a town. My friend, the driver, says, \\u201cWe\\u2019re almost at the theatre.\\u201d So we take a few more turns, get deeper into the town with more city scape. It\\u2019s quite old. The architecture, although I\\u2019ve never been there, looks Austrian - like a Hapsburg theatre would\\u2019ve looked like. It\\u2019s beautiful, intricate architecture. We park the car and walk in. The theatre has a giant arched doorway and as soon as you walk in, it\\u2019s got a hush where the soundproofing is perfect - you can\\u2019t hear any of the outside world. We walk down the carpet and we sit in the seats. I can feel the springs are perfectly loaded to absorb some of your body and they\\u2019re all cushioned so you don\\u2019t feel the spring itself. It just feels like you\\u2019re sinking into this hushed luxury. It\\u2019s a play. I don\\u2019t see any of the play in my dream. As soon as it\\u2019s supposed to start - the orchestra hasn\\u2019t even started yet - the dream shifts. The play is over. We\\u2019re instantly back in the car. Now I want them to stop at a gas station again because I need a different way of collecting the blood. They oblige. I don't tell them what for, I just ask them to stop at a certain place. I go in and I collect something that\\u2019s much more suited to my needs, go back into the washroom and get rid of the thing in the compartment designated for this kind of waste material. I put on something a lot more sleek and comfortable for me and securely attached. I get back in the car and we drive back through this same landscape. The driver drops my lover and I off at my door of my house. I go in. My son has fallen asleep in the living room on the couch. My daughter is upstairs in her room. So, my lover and I sit on the other couch. He falls asleep instantly. I have a cat now on my lap and am cat-paralyzed. I think, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s nothing to do here for a moment, so I\\u2019m going to look and see if there\\u2019s anything on tv.\\u201d I look down and there\\u2019s two things that interest me. One is a show about aliens, but history. Another is about this magical realm. The title is in Spanish: Tiende. I choose one of them - I think it\\u2019s the Tiende one - and I turn on the tv and I watch for a little bit. But now I'm getting uncomfortable because I don\\u2019t want to keep sitting still. The cat jumps off my lap. I get up, go back into the washroom, wash myself, and tend to my physical needs. I\\u2019m still bleeding, so I tend to that. I go back to the couch and sit down. My lover stirs a little bit and he reaches for me and pulls me over. We engage in a long deeply passionate but slow kiss. I can feel how sleepy he is and I\\u2019m starting to get tired. So the kiss completes itself with some kind of acknowledgement that there is mutual sleep to follow. I go upstairs. He\\u2019s back asleep on the couch. I get into bed and then wonder if he\\u2019s going to get cold when he wakes up. There\\u2019s no blanket down there. So I go into the spare room, get one of the blankets to cover him with it. When I go back downstairs, he has removed all his clothing. I cover him up. He says to me, in Spanish, now that I have come down with a blanket he has taken his clothes off. He says, \\u201cComo?\\u201d Then he falls back to sleep. I go back upstairs and that\\u2019s when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Rose Farm\\u201d This dream begins in the house where I grew up. I\\u2019m in the kitchen waiting for a phone call. Some man is in the basement and he\\u2019s making something and periodically he comes upstairs. He\\u2019s wearing a toolbelt, he has a saw and he grabs some nails that are in a box on top of the fridge and goes back down with them. So, each time he trucks up and down the stairs, I\\u2019m aware that he has not finished making what he\\u2019s making down there. There\\u2019s a special delivery that comes to the front door. I answer it and bring it back to the table to open. It\\u2019s a package that was sent by a woman named Maureen that composes aerobics classes for GoodLife Fitness in Canada. It says I\\u2019m sorry for your loss and open it up and it\\u2019s this choreography for an aerobics class. However, it\\u2019s just the musical score. There\\u2019s no direction of what to put with it. There\\u2019s another person in the kitchen now and she\\u2019s someone that teaches this class. I show her the score and say, \\u201cUm, this is a nice gesture but how useful is it without the steps? There\\u2019s no choreography. It's only the music.\\u201d She looks at it with me and says, \\u201cHmmm,\\u201d and starts to listen to it and see if she can put steps to it. She gives up and says, \\u201cthis is impossible.\\u201d She sits down and then I look at it again. I realize that the beat is in things you can do in 8 and if you take 5 steps to the front, 1 to the side, 1 to the back and go back to where you started it does equal 8. So I\\u2019m starting to try to figure this out and then the phone rings. It\\u2019s Maureen from Good Life and she\\u2019s in a peppy aerobics instructor voice, \\u201cHi, this is Maureen! Did you get my package?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, I did, but I\\u2019m not quite sure what to do with it seeing there\\u2019s no choreography.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh well, there\\u2019s a word for that.\\u201d And I reply back, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s Word!\\u201d as a rapper would say it. There\\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone and she\\u2019s somewhat offended. The conversation ends. I go back into the kitchen, fully prepared to keep trying to figure this out for myself when the carpenter has completed this small box. He gives it to me and says, \\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d As soon as I take the box in my hand, the scene deconstructs and I\\u2019m on this old farm. The farm has a sign in front of it and it\\u2019s called The Rose Farm. There\\u2019s a pump so you can pump the water up out of the ground. Everything is made of granite, which is a rock, and it\\u2019s faded pink. It really breathes history. The farm is strangely quiet, it\\u2019s almost like a museum. There\\u2019s no real activity going on in it. I go inside the farmhouse and there\\u2019s an old woman sitting there. My cat is with me. I say to her, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought something to comfort you.\\u201d I set the box down on the table. She\\u2019s sad. She looks up. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve brought my cat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, I think mine only has about an hour left.\\u201d Rather than seeing where her cat is lying, I see it as a vision in front of my eyes and it\\u2019s kind of suspended between the ground and the ceiling. The cat looks old - it looks like a 25 year old cat. Its fur is matted and its skin is emaciated away from its bones. The joints are big and round like arthritic. My cat is a lot younger, it\\u2019s black. It comes with me into the kitchen and my cat sits down beside me. We both wait there with her. Then I look at the wooden box I\\u2019ve set on the table and then I realize that it\\u2019s a coffin for her cat and she says, \\u201cThank you, I\\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here.\\u201d She takes the coffin and goes into the room and doesn't come back - neither one of them. And then my cat and I sit in the kitchen. I\\u2019m patting my cat and then the dream ends.\"],[\"\\u201cThe RV\\u201d I\\u2019m in an RV. It's kind of close quarters. There are at least three other people with me. We\\u2019re taking turns going to the back of the RV and using the washroom facilities. My belongings are in a suitcase tucked under the back bed and there is always something else on top of it or beside it, and always some waiting for someone else to get their things out first, so I can get to mine. It\\u2019s really cramped. Everything always seems rushed. I\\u2019m supposed to be hosting some kind of group discussion and I\\u2019ve been planning it for some time. There\\u2019s about twenty people involved and a certain day that it happens. In my dream, today is the day. I\\u2019m trying to use the washroom and get my clothes out, but there\\u2019s always someone else in there. I\\u2019m starting to feel rushed and I\\u2019m going to be late. I have this other book satchel that I brought on the trip and it had all the things I needed for the group discussion. It was all organized and I put it in there before the trip. There were pens I needed and a little tiny laptop and paper and a couple of other things that look like slim books, and they all fit in there nicely. I can\\u2019t find this. Someone has moved this. I\\u2019m looking for the people in the RV to ask them: \\u201cWho moved my thing? Where did you put it? I need it and have to go now.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s time to go and I can\\u2019t find it. So this lady named Maria says, \\u201cHere, I have a few pencils and a pad of paper you can use.\\u201d I notice that hers have her name on everything. Everything I\\u2019m using says Maria. I think that was a really good idea that she had. I thank her and exit out the RV. I go back behind it to a long building and I enter the building. There\\u2019s a big room like a studio room. People are already there and sitting and waiting. One of the people that signed up, before I can get to the place they\\u2019ve left empty for me, he sits down in it. I wonder what he\\u2019s doing. He opens this paperback book and starts reading these really cryptic sentences. I think, \\u201cWhat does that even mean? I can\\u2019t even recognize any part of that sentence as relating to the subject matter we\\u2019re gathered here for.\\u201d Now while I was happy to give him some time leading the group, because he was part of this group, I see everyone else is looking puzzled and it\\u2019s my responsibility to facilitate. I think I should redirect this somehow. So I quietly shuffle around the outside of the circle and come down on my hands and He holds up the cover and it\\u2019s some completely different book, completely different topic. So I say, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d He says, \\u201cOh, well, I had something scheduled before this, but my group didn\\u2019t show up or they were late. So I thought I would just take this time to get my stuff in anyway,\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t really do anything about this without completely disrupting and if they\\u2019re listening, I\\u201dll just walk away.\\u201d So I do. I leave him there to talk about whatever he was trying to talk about with my group. I get halfway back to the RV and three of the other group members have also left and run up behind me. They say, \\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI don't know. He just usurped my group and is using it for his own purposes.\\u201d They say, \\u201cWell, we came to hear you, so we\\u2019re not going back,\\u201d and they leave. I get to the RV and open up the door. Maria is sitting at the driver\\u2019s seat. I tell her, \\u201cThank you very much for your things. I didn\\u2019t need them. I really like the nametags. Where did you get them?\\u201d I tell her that Brad was taking over the group and say, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t he one of your students?\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, he is. He shouldn\\u2019t be doing that. I\\u2019m going to go see what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d She leaves the RV. I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sandbox'' In this odd mix of imagery and people, I find myself in a large two-story house with various people that I know from my extended family and where I currently work. The dream begins with C.R. from work and she\\u2019s been given the responsibility of taking care of two babies - one is about 10 months, almost ready to walk but not ready walking independently, and one can\\u2019t be anymore than 9 months older, not even two and he\\u2019s male. Later on in the dream when I ask what the children\\u2019s names are, someone tells me that the younger one is named Stacey and the older one is Alexander. So she\\u2019s taking care of them and I see her bring the babies out of a room and wonder if maybe they\\u2019ve just been bathed because they\\u2019re naked. She lays the younger one down on the rug beside the railing. The older one is standing. She tells them to stay there while she goes into a different room and gets diapers. I\\u2019m coming out of another room and I see them there and think, \\u201cWhy is she laying them there? It\\u2019s really close to the stairs.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that the younger one can roll and fall down the stairs. I start to move towards that child and at the same time, she rolls and goes all the way down the stairs face first! I\\u2019m just horrified and thinking, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d She lands at the bottom and C.R. comes out of the room carrying the diapers, picks her up, and she\\u2019s okay! She carries her back upstairs and says, \\u201cHere can you hold her?\\u201d So, I do. I\\u2019m standing there with a naked baby on my hip. I\\u2019m looking at her and thinking, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you pee on me!\\u201d And that\\u2019s when I ask, \\u201cWhose children are these and what are their names?\\u201d Someone comes up to me and says the younger one is Stacey, the older one is Alexander. They belong to someone, but the name is muffled so I can\\u2019t understand what it is. That person isn\\u2019t there right now. Now the scenery that evolves around me is a kitchen. I\\u2019m standing there and there's people at the table. I see my stepmom\\u2019s brother and sister-in-law who\\u2019ve been very kind to me throughout my life. My aunt has a natal wheel in her hand and she says to me (I\\u2019m still holding this kid on my hip), \\u201cIs it possible that each year on my birthday, the aspects will move into a different house?\\u201d I reply to her and say, \\u201cYes, because they move one degree ahead each year. I say, \\u201cSo if you have any aspects that are in the 29th degree of something last year, then this year, they\\u2019ll be at the 30th degree, so it\\u2019s on the cusp. Or if they were on the 30th last year they\\u2019ll be in the first degree the next one, so they\\u2019ll be all the way in a different house. What have you got there?\\u201d She shows me her natal wheel and I say, \\u201cOh look, you\\u2019ve got something that\\u2019s just moved into this house, which is ruled by Libra.\\u201d So she\\u2019s studying her chart and she\\u2019s absorbed by this. Then the kitchen suddenly expands and there\\u2019s a long dining room like my grandparents used to have. There\\u2019s a long table that seats 14 or 18 people and it\\u2019s set for dinner and there's chairs and whatnot. People start carrying dishes that they\\u2019ve prepared in the kitchen and they\\u2019re setting them out on the table. I\\u2019m vaguely aware that this is my extended family and the gathering is because it\\u2019s my aunt\\u2019s birthday. But at the same time, the children have been picked up by whoever owns them and I\\u2019m no longer carrying the one on my hip. Then, there\\u2019s this wooden small sandbox beside me. It\\u2019s a square box and made of plywood. It has a divider in it in the middle that divides the sandbox into 4 equal parts filled with sand. Another friend that I\\u2019ve recently starting talking to more from the studio where I teach, Arizona, is walking up that same hallway where those two kids were laying and the one fell down the stairs. He sees me and comes up and says, \\u201cWhat do you think about the election?\\u201d I say, \\u201cJust like this sandbox here, we have the same people in the same demographics and no matter who is running, the outcome is going to be the same because the sand hasn\\u2019t changed from its compartments.\\u201d He says to me, \\u201cI think you\\u2019re wrong and I\\u2019ll tell you why.\\u201d By this time, he\\u2019s walked all the way up the hallway and is now standing beside me in the kitchen. I say, \\u201cWhy? What do you think?\\u201d I\\u2019m really curious and given the political climate we live in, I\\u2019m obviously really hopeful because I would like for it to change. I don\\u2019t want the same person to be elected - he\\u2019s a Trump kind of person, but he\\u2019s not called Trump in the dream. So he starts talking to me and I can\\u2019t hear what he\\u2019s saying and I really want to hear him. He\\u2019s tilting his head to the side and I\\u2019m tilting my head to the side so I can still hear him and all of a sudden we\\u2019re lying down in a bed and I\\u2019m leaning in to hear what he\\u2019s saying the way you would lean into kiss someone, but the other person\\u2019s mouth is by your ear. Then I take my leg and wrap it over top him. His hands are around my low back and he flips me over, so I\\u2019m on my back but his hands are still behind me and he starts stroking underneath my buttocks and around my yoni from behind. It sends a rush of pleasure all the way up my spine and it was so pronounced that I woke up. I never got to hear what he thought about the election.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scaffold\\u201d This dream begins in some kind of childcare setting. I\\u2019ve applied to work there. The dream opens up on what I think is my first day of work. So I walk into a classroom. There are maybe 13 to 15 kids and they look to be around an early school age, like 5 or 6 years old. There are two teachers attending them. As soon as I arrive in the room, they leave. I think, \\u201cWow, way to throw me into this.\\u201d But within a few minutes, another teacher comes in and she introduces herself. She tells me she's there to train me. I think, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s good then because that was my understanding.\\u201d She starts describing the curriculum to me and giving me a little bit of information about each child. I\\u2019m taking this in and feeling that sounds familiar, as I\\u2019ve worked in this kind of educational setting before. We start to collect what we\\u2019ve done with the kids up and tell them it\\u2019s time to put their things away and get ready to go outside for outdoor time. The kids start going out the door. There\\u2019s something out in the playground. It\\u2019s really, really large. It\\u2019s large enough that it\\u2019s leaving a shadow on the window of the classroom. I can\\u2019t see how high up it goes. It\\u2019s quite looming. There are some men on it who are working on it, too. It has the feel of one of those scaffolds that construction sites have where you climb up and up and up to work on something at the top. It\\u2019s a safe platform for people as opposed to a ladder, which is not very safe and kind of flimsy. So there are a few men on this and they\\u2019re busy with it. I do note (not in my dream, but after waking), one of the men is black. There are also some plants that are starting to overgrow the bottom of whatever structure this is. They\\u2019re moving from this structure into the building. So while the person who is training me is supervising the playground, I am trying to moveis plant that is starting to grow inside the door of the classroom. It feels really strong in my hands. When I pick it up, it\\u2019s like a vine and fits into the palm of my hand like a rope that\\u2019s about 1 inch in diameter. Every time I try to move it away from the door, it just grows back. I\\u2019m doing this the whole time during playground time. The teacher and kids start to come back in the room now because outdoor time is over. We\\u2019re setting up for the after outdoor time curriculum. I feel that I\\u2019m starting to get sick. So, I get a paper towel from the wall, put it over my mouth and I get sick into it. I notice that the vmit is all blood colored, although it\\u2019s not blood. It\\u2019s like food or something like food. Then I put it in the garbage. I start to do something else, I feel myself getting sick again, so same thing - paper towel off the wall, vomit, put it into the garbage. I go to the sink in the classroom. I wash my hands, I wash my face. I come back to what I\\u2019m supposed to be doing. I am facilitating an activity at one of the tables. I\\u2019m only doing that for a few minutes when I get sick again. So I\\u2019m trying to hide this now because it\\u2019s my first day on the job and I\\u2019m training. I just want to finish out the day. I\\u2019m not feeling overly sick in my body. It\\u2019s just that this keeps happening. I keep vomiting. I keep throwing the paper towel out and then I\\u2019m fine. So I\\u2019m doing this until there\\u2019s another woman who comes into the room. Now I notice that the classroom has two sides. The other side is completely empty. There is no curriculum going on there, no teachers, no students. When this other woman comes in, she says to me: \\u201cHow are you doing on your first day?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh fine, I\\u2019m completely comfortable with this.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s good because I hired you to run the senior school program in this other side of the building. We\\u2019ve lost our teacher and that\\u2019s really what I had earmarked for you.\\u201d I feel a little bit surprised about this because I thought I was going to be hired to team teach with someone and I was really looking forward to team teaching. But, if that\\u2019s the job, then I\\u2019m not going to turn it down. So I ask her how much longer I have for training. She says, \\u201cAnother week or two. You let me know when you\\u2019re comfortable.\\u201d I think, \\u201cWell okay, that\\u2019s good then.\\u201d But as we\\u2019re talking, I feel another urge to be sick. So I take another paper towel off the wall and I\\u2019m 06sick into it. I surreptitiously wipe my mouth and put it in the garbage. I do this several times while she\\u2019s showing me around the empty classroom and describing what she wants to have go on in there. Then she looks at me and says, \\u201cAre you being sick?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes, I am.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s interesting. You\\u2019re not the only person who has been sick here. We\\u2019ve lost several teachers to the same thing.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHuh, because to me it seems that every time I touch that plant, \\u201c and I indicate the one that keeps trying to overgrow through the door and into the windows, \\u201cI get sick after. I wasn\\u2019t sick before I got here.\\u201d I wasn't sick before I arrived.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Scavenger Hunt\\u201d I\\u2019m in this outdoor space. It\\u2019s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It\\u2019s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they\\u2019re conifers. I don\\u2019t recall any deciduous trees at all. I\\u2019m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there\\u2019s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that\\u2019s hidden for the purpose that it\\u2019s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can\\u2019t see the marks unless you\\u2019re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don\\u2019t have any equipment. We\\u2019re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there\\u2019s some item that\\u2019s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There\\u2019s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What\\u2019s the natural food you do with fish food if there\\u2019s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I\\u2019m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it\\u2019s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it. Then it submerges itself. Right after that, an even bigger fish starts swimming up to the surface. It\\u2019s about twelve feet long! We all start running out. It\\u2019s the mother. There was only one piece of food and we\\u2019re thinking that we might be the other food. Each one of these spots has hazards and the thing you\\u2019re supposed to solve. Some people are able to remember three red dots and they just keep moving back. Other people can only remember one at a time so they go back down to the bottom of the hill and look through the night vision glass again. One of these times when I go back down there Omar is there. We group together to do our scavenger hunt. We have to go quite far. It\\u2019s a lot farther out than some of the ones that are closeby. There is a long climb up a tree then you have to move from the tree onto a rock cliff face. We swing onto the rock. There\\u2019s a forest ranger lookout tower and we climb up it. He finds all this survival equipment - tiny packages of dehydrated food wrapped in plastic and shirts with long sleeves individually wrapped in plastic. They\\u2019re the kind of shirt that protects you from the sun. There are other things also wrapped in plastic. Because he got there first, he has this big box. Luckily I was there, too, because it\\u2019s really impossible to hold a box and climb back down to the night vision pane of glass. So he hands me the box, then climbs down, then I hand him the box and climb down. This is how we get down. Once we get down, he is tasked with needing to divide the contents of the box equally between all the participants of this scavenger hunt. While he\\u2019s doing this, I go and find more of the marks. When I come back, he\\u2019s finished the task. Apparently, it\\u2019s my job to disperse the packages he\\u2019s divided and give one to each person. For some reason, he\\u2019s written really, really tiny and the ink of the pen he was using is really blotchy and runs out sometimes. It\\u2019s really hard to read the names. I\\u2019m trying to guess some of them. I do. I have another pen and am writing on the top trying to fill in the blanks. It starts to get dark. There\\u2019s one more task to finish. I go up the hill to a grassy area. There\\u2019s a lawnmower. Those two things go together. What do you do with a lawnmower? You cut grass. Only it\\u2019s really tricky because the grass is growing on the side of a slope and it\\u2019s pretty much a vertical rise. That\\u2019s the only long grass. I\\u2019m trying to push the lawnmower up and then guide it back down so it doesn\\u2019t flip over and cut my feet with the blade. I do this. It\\u2019s dark. This man comes over and comments that I\\u2019ve done a good job. The other tricky part about doing this is that there are some plants - angel\\u2019s trumpet - growing on that slope. You wouldn\\u2019t cut that with your lawnmower. So I have to be careful to get the grass without damaging the angel's trumpet. I finish this and then leave the lawnmower. At this point, there\\u2019s some kind of alarm raised. Everybody is running. There is some chaos. I see someone I know. I run over to her and ask if she knows what\\u2019s going on. She\\u2019s not sure and says I should stay here. This is one of the flat spots, a plateau. Others are gathering here, too. I see Omar and realize I didn\\u2019t finish dispersing all the survival kits. I can feel the fear in people as we\\u2019re standing and waiting to see if we have eased the threat by finding the marks and solving the puzzles, doing what we need to do? This question is just hanging in there.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Shopping Mall\\u201d I\\u2019m in a large urban city. It\\u2019s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can\\u2019t identify where I am because of it. I\\u2019m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I\\u2019ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It\\u2019s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I\\u2019m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says \\u201cyou are here\\u201d and lists the index of all the stores, but I don\\u2019t see one. Because I\\u2019m still looking, I\\u2019m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren\\u2019t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they\\u2019re offering. They\\u2019re all specialty shops. Each store that\\u2019s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they\\u2019re not made of raincoat material or anything; they\\u2019re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they\\u2019ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there\\u2019s very little inventory offered in each. I think, \\u201cWow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.\\u201d Then I figure that whatever it is that they\\u2019re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what\\u2019s in the windows and note in a general way, \\u201cOh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I\\u2019m not even going to look at it.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Skyscraper\\u201d I\\u2019m standing on the ground and I\\u2019m looking at a skyscraper. I can see that there are people on the very top of it - maybe three or four people. Just off the top, actually hanging over the edge a couple of feet down are two other people. There\\u2019s no scaffolding. They have a rappel line buckled in just below the belly. I don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s attached to, but it does seem to be attached to the building. They all look completely relaxed. I don\\u2019t know how I can see this from so far away. They look like silhouettes - the people are all black silhouettes, although it\\u2019s daytime. I can see the building is made of some kind of grey concrete. They\\u2019re waving - not even hanging on with both hands. Then suddenly I\\u2019m on top of the building. I can feel how windy it is up there. I feel kind of nervous. When I look over the edge to see who these two people were that were down there, I get really dizzy. My feet are both on the roof, but the sheer height of this skyscraper is massive - it\\u2019s fifty stories high. The dream is about the vertical and dizziness and just feeling it.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Songwriter\\u201d I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It\\u2019s like a small theatre, so it\\u2019s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they\\u2019re hosting a band. I don\\u2019t sit at one of the seats though, I\\u2019m standing at the back. I\\u2019m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I\\u2019m listening to the lyrics because I\\u2019m familiar with them. I\\u2019m really just wanting to enjoy how they\\u2019re paired with the melody. We\\u2019re about four songs in. He sings this one and it\\u2019s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I\\u2019m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn\\u2019t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight\\u2019s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I\\u2019m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he\\u2019s finished and, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d I say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s something I want to tell you about that song.\\u201d I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It\\u2019s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It\\u2019s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, \\u201cOh, where did this come from?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI found it in your friend\\u2019s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he\\u2019s dead.\\u201d It\\u2019s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn\\u2019t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn\\u2019t really grieved his friend\\u2019s death. That\\u2019s why I think it\\u2019s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It\\u2019s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, \\u201cNo way, he wouldn\\u2019t have written this for me.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.\\u201d I can see it\\u2019s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I\\u2019m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It\\u2019s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d How could there be any other result here other than he\\u2019s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?\\u201d He\\u2019s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he\\u2019s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, \\u201cThank you for showing me this.\\u201d We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Sound\\u201d I\\u2019m on my way or coming from somewhere. I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven\\u2019t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We\\u2019re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It\\u2019s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can\\u2019t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they\\u2019re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it\\u2019s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they\\u2019re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn\\u2019t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, \\u201cYes, I know. I don\\u2019t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, are you coming for Trina\\u2019s fiftieth birthday?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t know about that, but maybe.\\u201d She writes the date down and tells me it\\u2019s going to be on April first. When she\\u2019s writing this down I say, \\u201cYou know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn\\u2019t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh, well I\\u2019ll put my phone number down here, too.\\u201d She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have yours either.\\u201d She gives me another piece of paper, it\\u2019s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I\\u2019m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it\\u2019s so small that there isn\\u2019t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, \\u201cHmm, there\\u2019s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I\\u2019ll be right back.\\u201d While she\\u2019s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I\\u2019m doing this, she says to me, \\u201cHave you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d She says, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they\\u2019re trying to change things in this town.\\u201d I think to myself, \\u201cWow they must really have their work cut out for them because there\\u2019s so much dark horribleness in this place.\\u201d She\\u2019s telling me that there\\u2019s a movement against them coming in. I just say, \\u201cNo, I didn\\u2019t know about either one.\\u201d Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I\\u2019m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I\\u2019m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I\\u2019ve asked her for a drink of water which I\\u2019ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it\\u2019s windy and they\\u2019re blowing open. So I\\u2019m trying to pee as I\\u2019m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it\\u2019s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, \\u201cCome back anytime.\\u201d I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there\\u2019s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way. I just press his phone number to see if he\\u2019s home because I don\\u2019t want to go out there if he isn\\u2019t. Then I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Stairs\\u201d I\\u2019m in kind of like an office building, that\\u2019s what it feels like. Everything is that institutional color, white or grey. There are a lot of windows but no design or creativity to the architecture, it\\u2019s just put together. The dream begins on the bottom floor. There is one couch and a whole bunch of boxes of clothes. I\\u2019ve brought one of them here with my daughter\\u2019s clothes from where she was four and five. I brought them because her godparents at the time, their daughter is three and most of the clothes have only been worn a couple of times so they look brand new, including this pair of white girls shoes that you put on for special occasions. She only had them on for one two-hour thing, it was a funeral, and I carried her for most of it. The godparents are looking through their daughter\\u2019s own clothes trying to find a pair of shoes. I tell them that there\\u2019s a pair that I brought in the box of clothes. The godmother says nothing and continues to look through the boxes of clothes as though I haven\\u2019t spoken. Her husband says, \\u201cOh thanks, that would be great! Where is the box that you brought?\\u201d I tell him, \\u201cI put it over there.\\u201d He goes that way and starts looking for it. In the meantime, I\\u2019m sitting on the couch with their daughter. She normally doesn\\u2019t laugh and I know this. She doesn\\u2019t express her emotions very well. I\\u2019m very careful not to pick her up and toss her around the way some adults do with the kids or disrespect her space. I just sit on the couch and if she wants to come over, she will. I look at her and talk to her. I notice that she has a really old face for a three year old. I find this compelling. I\\u2019m really paying attention because I think she has some wisdom that has perhaps been overlooked due to the fact that she\\u2019s in a three year old body. She eventually toddles over and sits on my lap. She\\u2019s facing me and she grabs my hands. You know how kids run up your body and then they somersault while they\\u2019re holding your hands? She does that. I\\u2019m a little surprised because I know she\\u2019s reputed to be standoffish; however, I\\u2019m quite familiar with this move so we do it. After the second one she starts to laugh and her parents look at me with some surprise. The mom looks annoyed and comes over and tries to grab her, but she says no to her mom and does the somersaults a few more times and is laughing. By this time, I\\u2019m uncomfortable. I ask the child if it\\u2019s okay if I set her down on the couch. She says she doesn\\u2019t want me to do that. I say, \\u201cOkay, how \\u2018bout we stand up and help look in the boxes?\\u201d She agrees to do this but wants to be carried. I shift her so she\\u2019s balanced on my left hip. We walk towards her dad who finds the shoes at that moment. He says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s get you dressed.\\u201d I give her to her dad. Now I\\u2019m on some kind of rescue mission and am supposed to go up to the top floor of the building. I walk over to the stairwell. It\\u2019s like if you look at stairs from the side of the building and you can see that there\\u2019s a forty-five degree angle going up and then another one going up, and you can see all these angles, but you can also see the ones going down as if you\\u2019re right beside it and seeing through the glass. They look like this when I\\u2019m trying to go up them. The down-going stairs are mixed in with the up-going stairs. The first time, it\\u2019s quite clear to me and I can see the up-going stairs anyway. I go to the top floor where I\\u2019m supposed to be. There\\u2019s a woman and I have an appointment with her. I make it for the appointment. She talks to me but I don\\u2019t remember what we say to each other. She gives me some kind of assignment that I\\u2019m responsible for. I take it. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s something physical; it\\u2019s something in my mind. I accept it. I go back down the stairs. I realize that I have a question that I\\u2019m uncertain about. As soon as I get to the bottom I want to go back up the stairs. I do one flight and then the down-going stairs exerts itself in front of me. I go down one flight anyway because I have to in order to access the up-going stairs. But the access for the up-going stairs isn\\u2019t there, so I go down one more flight thinking I\\u2019ll find it but I don\\u2019t. Now I\\u2019m feeling concerned because I\\u2019ve gone down two flights of stairs and I don\\u2019t want to be down here. I see the door open and it\\u2019s really dark where that person has come from - it\\u2019s like an underground parking lot with that creepy kind of feel to it. I think if I watch what they\\u2019re doing then I can find the up-going stairs. But they\\u2019re running really quickly. I can hear their footsteps going up but I can\\u2019t see what path they\\u2019ve taken. I follow the up-going stairs anyway. It takes me back up the two flights that I mistakenly descended. Then I\\u2019m trying to continue going up back to the offices but the down-going stairs keeps mixing up. This time I\\u2019m smarter and I don\\u2019t take the down-going flights, I just keep trying to find the up-going ones. After a little while I realize I can\\u2019t and think I\\u2019ll have to go on the mission anyway with these questions in my mind.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Studio\\u201d I\\u2019m at the studio where I teach. It\\u2019s set up differently, though. The front of the building extends way out into the street and instead of just having a glass front, three of the sides are glass so it\\u2019s a lot more transparent and visible to people walking by. Before it always felt like a sanctuary with natural brick walls and the glass front and wood floors. In this dream it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. I\\u2019m standing at the front desk which is a lot bigger. One of the owners is there. The back hallway that normally leads into the studio is now a back entrance, so people are coming in the back entrance as well. There\\u2019s more than one studio now with two doors. I see my ex-husband and a bunch of his high school friends. They\\u2019re walking like a clump of high school age guys, pushing each other playfully and stuff like that. They walk in without checking in at the desk because they\\u2019re all self-absorbed. They just go down the hall into the studio. The owner is trying to piece together their names and check off their memberships for them. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cOh great, they\\u2019re going to be in my class that I\\u2019m about to teach in a half hour.\\u201d I\\u2019m mentally rearranging my sequence so I can make it more physical because guys that age need that in order to focus and be present. So I\\u2019m just standing there in my head for a few minutes. Then a bunch of people come in through the back behind me. They\\u2019re also really loud. I don\\u2019t get to finish processing how I\\u2019m going to change my class in my head. They\\u2019re asking questions about the kids class. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cKids class? We don\\u2019t have kids yoga.\\u201d My answer surprised them a little. They're talking amongst themselves. I look at the time and see that it\\u2019s time for me to teach my class. I go across to the hall and am starting my music. I go into the door and instead of a whole bunch of people lying on their mats, there\\u2019s a teacher from the jujitsu studio standing at the front and a whole bunch of eight year olds. I notice the room is really hot not because it\\u2019s a hot class but because there\\u2019s been so much body heat in there working really hard. It hits me like a wall when I open the door. I go back to the desk and say to the owner: \\u201cDo we have kids yoga?\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t reply. She\\u2019s already engaging with the group that had come in from the back and discussing the kids yoga with them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, hmm, I guess they do.\\u201d Then I wait for her to finish her conversation with them. I say, \\u201cI don't know where my class is. The room is full of other people and kids.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOh they\\u2019re supposed to have finished five minutes ago.\\u201d I go back to the door and this time they see me because I\\u2019m standing with the door open. The teacher says, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll just be five more minutes.\\u201d I open the door fully and turn to look at the back of the room. I see my whole class practically sitting on top of each other. They don\\u2019t have their mats rolled out. My ex-husband is there with his gang. They\\u2019re all wrestling, piled on top of each other. Now it\\u2019s fifteen minutes past the time I was supposed to teach. I go back out to the desk. I tell the studio owner that it\\u2019s disrespectful to not follow the guidelines when you\\u2019re supposed to start and stop a class. She sighs, kind of dejectedly. Then we start talking about an energy exchange. She says, \\u201cWe both need it. I can give you a hot stone massage and I\\u2019m really in need of a thai massage.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, that sounds like a really good idea.\\u201d We don\\u2019t deal with the problem of the room stuffed with people. The dream skips over and we\\u2019re trying to set up one of the rooms in the back hallway for the energy exchange. But as soon as we get into the room, the group of kids yoga is exiting and they\\u2019re all over the place. I realize I have to go into teach and say, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m sorry, I can\\u2019t actually do the energy exchange, I have to go teach.\\u201d I go into teach. The group changed all the playlist around so I\\u2019m trying to figure out where mine is because now it\\u2019s playing hard rock. I do that. I put the quiet song on. I do manage to get everyone onto their mats and I start to teach my class. The dream blips. I don\\u2019t remember teaching the entirety of my class. When I come back out to the desk, the studio owner tells me she can\\u2019t do the energy exchange because she has a baseball game to go to now. She says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ask you to come all the way in on a Saturday for this.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she\\u2019s being kind of passive aggressive about this because her tone of voice and body language imply that she does want me to come in on a Saturday for this. I think I don't. I say, \\u201cWell is there any other Monday that you would be available? I could come in a little earlier before I teach.\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, I have baseball on all of them.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking that she obviously knew that when we talked about an energy exchange so she really did mean to exchange on a Saturday. I decline the Saturday and leave the building. I start trudging through the stone and guess I\\u2019m going home. I get part way there and I see my ex-sister-in-law\\u2019s two dogs. I forget their names, they\\u2019re a specialty breed and look kind of like poodles or labradoodles, medium sized-dogs. I see them in the snow. One is more of a carmel color and the other is more white. The carmel color one is having trouble walking through the snow. It\\u2019s stopping and the snow plow hasn\\u2019t come by yet. They think they\\u2019re in a snow bank but they\\u2019re actually in the middle of the road. I pick up the carmel colored one and the white one is still running through. I forget their names so I\\u2019m just calling it, \\u201cCome on! Come on you can do this!\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to encourage it to go back over to the sidewalk. I\\u2019m going to walk the dogs home. The one I\\u2019m carrying is kind of heavy and my feet and legs feel heavy because of the snow. I look behind me for one second and then I don\\u2019t see the white one anymore. I look back the way I came and it\\u2019s lying down in the middle of the road. At first I think it\\u2019s dead. I touch it and it responds and it\\u2019s still warm, so it\\u2019s not dead. Now I\\u2019ve got both of the dogs in my arms and am trying to hold them under my arms like two footballs. They\\u2019re obviously sick and not well. I\\u2019m worried that their life is beginning to blink out. I\\u2019m struggling with them as I go down the sidewalk into the Co-op. It\\u2019s funny because she never lived there, but her twin sister did. I get stuck. There\\u2019s a community yard sale going on. I notice where the office used to be is a sign that now says, \\u201cSeneca College.\\u201d It\\u2019s now an office where they are trying to recruit teenagers from the Co-op directly into the college. I think that\\u2019s a pretty good idea. I\\u2019m trying to walk up the sidewalk towards her unit. There\\u2019s another dog and it\\u2019s a whippet - a racing dog with a long pointy nose. It\\u2019s snarling and growling aggressively as if it\\u2019s going to attack the other two dogs. I\\u2019ve got them in my arms and they\\u2019re not responding. They\\u2019re barely breathing. I tell this group of teenagers: \\u201cCan you please go ahead of me so there are people between that dog and these because it\\u2019s going to attack. They oblige. They do and are really nice about it. But we\\u2019re moving really slowly. I finally get to her door and knock on it and say, \\u201cLook who I found.\\u201d She\\u2019s so grateful and I say, \\u201cOh, you live beside where I live!\\u201d Now it\\u2019s twenty years ago and I\\u2019m apparently living in the same unit I lived in when my daughter was little. She gets the dogs back and puts them in a specialty bed she made for them. She\\u2019s a nurse and is looking after them and everything seems to be fine.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Symphony\\u201d I\\u2019m at my friends Maggie and Joey\\u2019s house, only it\\u2019s not their house, it\\u2019s the old Farm House. Maggie and Joey live there. I\\u2019ve gone up to visit them. Maggie has all kinds of little interesting things for us to do. We\\u2019re making jelly at one point. Then we go into a different room and are doing a craft. We\\u2019re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he\\u2019s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That\\u2019s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I\\u2019m wondering what\\u2019s going on with him because he\\u2019s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, \\u201cCome and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he\\u2019s wearing a tux.\\u201d I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some \\u201cdoing of the hair.\\u201d I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She\\u2019s got several things that she\\u2019s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don\\u2019t think anything of this. I think she\\u2019s just seeing how this will look or how these two items will look if you put them together. Then she says to me, \\u201cI can\\u2019t go. I\\u2019m really sick. I don\\u2019t feel up to this. But it\\u2019s something Joey really wants to do.\\u201d I ask her, \\u201cWhat do you mean, you\\u2019re sick?\\u201d She tells me she\\u2019s been sick for a really long time and she thinks that her time is limited. I feel this grief moving up through my feet, through my legs and into my heart. It kind of suspends all my decision making qualities. I\\u2019m just standing there trying to take this all in. i look at her really closely, looking for traces of truth, not of her words, but that her body is actually that sick. I\\u2019m looking at her skin and the sclera of her eyes. I\\u2019m trying to see what I have not noticed before and wasn\\u2019t aware of. Then I tell her I don\\u2019t want to go to the symphony and she should do this because it\\u2019s something special and they\\u2019ve been planning it for a long time. Then suddenly her hair is drawn back into a formal style with a bun at the back of her head. She\\u2019s wearing earrings that dangle down from her ears. She\\u2019s dressed in a strapless gown. She looks beautiful. We go back down the stairs. This time she disappears into the kitchen. I\\u2019m in the living room and Joey is standing there. I say, \\u201cI hope you guys have a really good time. This will be wonderful. You two look fabulous.\\u201d He comes over and gives me a hug. His face is overtop my left shoulder. I can feel that he\\u2019s crying. He says, \\u201cI hope you're still here when we get back.\\u201d Now I just feel kind of numb. I feel heavy. I no longer know what to do while they\\u2019re gone and I don\\u2019t want to stay in the house but I do. I look outside down the long farmhouse style driveway. All the earth looks frozen. The trees are bare. There\\u2019s no growth left in the ground. It\\u2019s nighttime. Even in the activity that was in the house of jamming things in jars and making preserves is tucked away. The house feels empty. I think, \\u201cMaybe I should just have a bath and go to bed.\\u201d\"],[\"\\u201cThe Talent Show\\u201d I\\u2019m at a Yoga Studio where I used to teach but stopped because they basically tricked me into working for them by promising me a certain rate but refused to sign a contract I asked them to sign. I worked for them for a whole month without knowing what I would be paid. They figured I would just keep doing it because I had formed an attachment to the people in the class. I\\u2019m just standing inside the front door of the studio. My son is with me. I see the owner\\u2019s daughter but I don\\u2019t recognize her at first because she\\u2019s lost so much weight, she\\u2019s even about six inches shorter, and she\\u2019s wearing a lot of eye makeup. I deduce who she is because she\\u2019s behind the desk, not because I recognize her. There are a lot of people and families in there and in fact it\\u2019s packed, which surprises me. The owner walks in and he gives me a cold glance and keeps walking. My son has mingled with the people, although I didn\\u2019t intend to stay, I need to get him to go home. The only reason I\\u2019m there is to pick something up from the desk. The owner\\u2019s daughter is looking for it for me. The director is the main person that wouldn\\u2019t sign the contract and kept telling me she was going to the next day and the day and the next day until I started teaching. She delayed until they thought it was too difficult for me to back out. She\\u2019s behind me and gushing about being so happy to see me. I feel like it\\u2019s a performance for the people standing around. She\\u2019s got one of her hands on each of my shoulders and she\\u2019s standing behind me but to the side. I feel repulsed by the fact that she\\u2019s touching me and pretending to be this beaming friendly person when she\\u2019s a viper on the inside. Then, it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being moved forward by the crowd. I move with the flow because I\\u2019m scanning for my son and I need him because I\\u2019m ready to go. The owner\\u2019s daughter is standing beside me and talking to me. We get into the actual practice room and there\\u2019s a stage at the front. There must be two-hundred people in there, families, sitting on blankets and towels. She asks me if I want to sit down beside her. I agree. Then I gradually take in what\\u2019s going on here. It\\u2019s set up for kids. All the kids are wearing costumes and there are three boys on the stage. They\\u2019re setting up for some kind of act. I finally catch up with my son and he says, \\u201cMom, can we please stay? I want to sing two songs.\\u201d The owner\\u2019s daughter indicates that it would be okay if we stayed. I tell him, \\u201cAlright.\\u201d We sit down. For the first act, you can\\u2019t even figure out what the boys are doing. They\\u2019re on for about ten minutes. Nobody is stage directing. It\\u2019s just really laissez-faire. Other kids are running across the stage as these three are acting out something, but it\\u2019s not cohesive, it has no direction. At one point, one jumps down from the stage really slowly and pretends to fall. The other takes a run from the side and slides across the stage. It just goes on and on. I think, \\u201cOh my god, we\\u2019re going to be here for hours and hours.\\u201d That\\u2019s how the dream ends, just sitting and waiting.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Time Machine\\u201d This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There\\u2019s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house\\u2019s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it\\u2019s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I\\u2019m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it\\u2019s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, \\u201cI have to take this.\\u201d He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he\\u2019s in the kitchen, although I haven\\u2019t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He\\u2019s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, \\u201cHe left you a gift.\\u201d I feel sad. I also feel like I don\\u2019t want to be alone with her. I\\u2019m starting to wonder how I\\u2019m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I\\u2019m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I\\u2019m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there\\u2019s a really strong emotion. It\\u2019s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that\\u2019s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn\\u2019t appear and I knew it wouldn\\u2019t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I\\u2019m an adult now. I\\u2019m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it\\u2019s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don\\u2019t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I\\u2019m hoping they\\u2019ll still be there when I leave. I\\u2019m glad he still hasn\\u2019t returned to England and I\\u2019ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I\\u2019m confused because I can\\u2019t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it\\u2019s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they\\u2019re in charge: \\u201cDo you know what happened to the classrooms?\\u201d She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, \\u201cDo you know this one is out of date?\\u201d I say, \\u201cOh, no I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d She says, \\u201cYes, you\\u2019ll need to go down to the office.\\u201d She tells me the number of the office and says, \\u201cYou need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.\\u201d I think I\\u2019ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They\\u2019re just saying hello and stuff and I haven\\u2019t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren\\u2019s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on asphalt in a really old town. I\\u2019m part of a play. It\\u2019s like a movie set, but it\\u2019s not a movie set, it\\u2019s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I\\u2019ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It\\u2019s white and about 12 inches square - it\\u2019s a cube. They put this in between each word. It\\u2019s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that\\u2019s describing this tells me, \\u201cYes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they\\u2019ve been forgotten.\\u201d He told me the one we\\u2019re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there\\u2019s a picnic table. We\\u2019re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we\\u2019re waiting. It\\u2019s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it\\u2019s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They\\u2019re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn\\u2019t have food, though. He has sewing. I\\u2019m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don\\u2019t even know what it is - I choose that one. I\\u2019m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it\\u2019s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we\\u2019re entering this vehicle. It\\u2019s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but I think it\\u2019s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it\\u2019s got some kind of engine - it\\u2019s not very loud; it\\u2019s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we\\u2019re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,\\u201dWe\\u2019re going out this way.\\u201d I watch them and am thinking, \\u201cOh my god! They\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d They\\u2019re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Toddler\\u201d In this dream, I am on a beach at a resort. I am somehow inserted with this family and the son is one of my friends in real life . He\\u2019s on the periphery of the dream - he comes in with the family and does some stuff, then leaves and does his own thing. I don\\u2019t seem to be as mobile. There\\u2019s two sisters and one brother. The one sister has three children and her partner. The other sister does not have any; she doesn\\u2019t have a partner either. I don\\u2019t really have anything to do with any of them. In the dream, I am in this enclosure. It\\u2019s kind of open like a yurt situated on the beach. I seem to be involved with the careeving of the kids. One boy is 7 and my friend does a lot of things with this 7 year old kid. In the dream, I notice that he\\u2019s a gym teacher. He takes his 7 year old nephew with him to class a lot, so they share a lot of quality time together. They share a love of movement and athletic sports. At one point, I realize that my friend is actually wearing the 7 year old\\u2019s clothes. He takes his shirt off at one point and the hat. I\\u2019m looking at them on the counter and I don't want to directly ask him if he\\u2019s wearing the 7 year old\\u2019s clothes, so I look at the tags on the hat and the clothes and I say, \\u201cThese say size 7. I\\u2019m surprised that they fit you.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s possible that they may be my nephew\\u2019s clothing.\\u201d At that point I realize we\\u2019re in a change room. I\\u2019m also changing and every time I take off my shorts, there\\u2019s another pair of shorts underneath them. I keep trying to take them off because I\\u2019m trying to change and it just keeps going on and on, like 10-20 times where I keep taking them off and there\\u2019s another pair of shorts underneath them. In the dream, this frustrates me. I give up trying to change and I go back from that one area of the yurt where people change to the common area where people are sitting and eating. The dad asks me if I would sit with the youngest child of the three for a few minutes, so I do. The child tells me that his name is Mason and he\\u2019s not two years old yet, he\\u2019s barely over 1, probably about 14 months old. He starts talking to me and telling me what he wants to eat and how to make it. I\\u2019m listening to him and he has the voice of an old man - not a voice that sounds like an old man, but what he\\u2019s saying is in a mature voice of a person much older than he is. I\\u2019m wondering if anyone else realizes this. The dad comes and sits down beside me for a moment. Without asking the question, I just look at him and he tells me that his son has some abilities we don\\u2019t fully know about yet. I think that must explain the deep observations this very young child is talking to. Plus I realize that any words at all at 14 months is advanced. I feel this child has a mystical quality to him. l check out for the rest of the dream, whatever activities I had been involved in, I decide to hang out with this baby and just listen to this baby and the observations he\\u2019s making because the soul that is in his body is someone he\\u2019s channeling that is very wise. I do this for some time and I feel like I\\u2019ve been shared with. The rest of the dream takes on some kind of mystical quality. I see the other sister that doesn\\u2019t have any children on the beach. She\\u2019s wearing clothes that will attract attention to her body. She\\u2019s very beautiful. I see her wrapped up in the need to be admired and not so much connecting to the people around her. The dream deconstructs and I\\u2019m in a house I lived in when I was teaching college. I lived there with a roommate on Simcoe Street in a city that starts with O. My ex-husband is in there, as well. He is spending an inordinate amount of money on something and I realize I\\u2019ve been paying for it without consciously being aware of it. I ask him if we can talk about this. He keeps saying later. I realize in the dream that I either have to keep paying for his lack of conscious awareness or if I stop paying for it, he will just disappear.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Toothbrush\\u201d In this dream, I am on my way to a concert in Toronto. I\\u2019m with a couple friends - one is a friend of mine, A.G., and the other is my first boyfriend for a little while in high school. We\\u2019ll call him Daren. So in this dream, I\\u2019m with A.G. and Daren. and we\\u2019re on our way to a concert. We stop at his parent\\u2019s place which isn\\u2019t where his parents actually lived. It\\u2019s in a city called Burlington and they\\u2019re living on Plains Rd. The house is really dense on the inside. It\\u2019s like a hoarder house where you can\\u2019t walk through the hallways. You can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s on the other end of the hallways. They have all these pets that they\\u2019re constantly looking for because they can\\u2019t find them in all this hoarding mess. So we arrive there and I guess we have to stay overnight. We\\u2019ve arrived late and the concert is the next day in the afternoon, so we\\u2019ve decided to go and sleep there because it\\u2019s closer to leave from his parents\\u2019 place. When we get there, his mom is looking for one of the pets - it\\u2019s this weird amalgamation of a dog and a cat. At first I think it\\u2019s a dog but when I look more closely at it, it has the body of a cat and the neck and head of a dog. We see it for a moment and then it\\u2019s gone again. So all of us are trying to squeeze our way through this house. It seems like in the dream I\\u2019m doing this without any contact from anyone else for what feels like hours. Then I come out into the kitchen and I see Daren and I ask him if he\\u2019s had any luck. He says, \\u201cNot yet, but there\\u2019s this whole other half of the house I haven\\u2019t checked.\\u201d I don\\u2019t say this outloud but I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWow, this house is so much bigger than it appears to be because of all the stuff.\\u201d So we start off together into the doorway through the other side of the house. It\\u2019s like the air in there is colder - the way it would feel if you were going down in altitude into a cave where it just feels damper and colder, but it still has stuff in it. I can\\u2019t see anything. I see this other creature. It\\u2019s a combination of a hedgehog and a guinea pig. It walks past me and Daren says to me, \\u201cMake sure you don\\u2019t let that guy out.\\u201d I look and suddenly realize there\\u2019s a pocket door I could close, so I do. The little creature stays in there. We get out of this next hallway and his mom and dad are sitting in the next clearing. Daren tells them that he hasn\\u2019t been able to find the dog. Then I look over and I say, \\u201cIs that it?\\u201d It\\u2019s partially masked by some other thing and I can\\u2019t even figure out what this creature is. It\\u2019s black and it has limbs, but there\\u2019s no discernable face on it. Daren says, \\u201cYes that\\u2019s it!\\u201d And he goes over and gets it and picks it up and takes it to his mom. They\\u2019re so happy and patting it. I leave them there and see there\\u2019s a door behind the dad which actually has daylight. I decide to leave out that door, walk all the way around and come in the other door we entered in. It\\u2019s a measure of avoiding all these cluttered passages. So I do that and when I come in, my friend is trying to kiss Daren and I\\u2019m thinking to myself, \\u201cThat\\u2019s very strange behavior for her and awkward!\\u201d But he pulls back and walks over. Now I have a cup of tea in my hand and I\\u2019m sitting at a table and I see that his eyes are actually filling up with tears. He\\u2019s upset that she did that. I say, \\u201cWell, why didn\\u2019t you tell her? You should have said something.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to ruin this for everyone.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell I\\u2019ll go over and say something\\u201d He tells me not to for the same reason - it will ruin this event. I\\u2019m sitting with this and thinking that it\\u2019s kind of ruined anyway. It\\u2019s awkward and with no one talking about it, it will just sit there and fester. Then he says, \\u201cAre you ready to go?\\u201d I say, \\u201cWhat? No! I haven\\u2019t even finished my tea.\\u201d I realize that when I came in, I had a toothbrush and I brushed my teeth in the bathroom. I can\\u2019t figure out how to get through all these hallways with the clutter to go back and check the bathroom. I look through my suitcase which is just a little carry case like a backpack with a whole bunch of zippers. I\\u2019m opening all the zippers and looking in each compartment and it looks like it has my belongings in it, but each zippered compartment is empty. There's no toothbrush and I tell him I don\\u2019t want to leave without brushing my teeth. He does the eye roll thing, \\u201cYou better hurry up, I don\\u2019t want to be late.\\u201d So the rest of the dream I\\u2019m lifting up things and looking underneath them, trying to find my toothbrush.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Trek\\u201d The setting is in a way that it\\u2019s not the orderly kind of linear almost based on Roman architecture grid for cities that we have now - it\\u2019s not like that, it\\u2019s much different. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Agrarian either. I get the feeling that it\\u2019s again post-apocalyptic, but much further along in the future than the dream when I was standing in a burnt world and started choking and woke up because I was choking. Everyone here, we are wearing ragged bits of eclectic pieces of clothing. There\\u2019s no real recognizable city structure. There\\u2019s ruined buildings with grass and vegetation growing up, in, around the building. People have settled there and built structures out of other scraps and things. It\\u2019s not unpleasant to look at. It has a settled, organized, civilized feel to it. However, there\\u2019s agrimony between groups of people who have settled around these places. Part of the group that I am settling with, we know we have to flee or we\\u2019re probably going to be killed. So we organize very quickly. We can\\u2019t bring all of our stuff. Our stuff is an eclectic variety of things that we use to feed ourselves and clothe ourselves with. Some people have backpacks and these are being dispersed among the group. I\\u2019d say there\\u2019s probably about 60 or 75 in my group, but for the purpose of traveling and feeding ourselves, we organize ourselves into four groups, so there\\u2019s about twelve to fifteen in each group. They are dividing people into groups by skill level, so if you have already shown some survival skill behavior, they don\\u2019t put all of those people in one group. They\\u2019re separating them so there\\u2019s at least one person who\\u2019s got some know-how in each group. I\\u2019m one of those people who has some survival skills. I\\u2019m separated from some of my closer friends because we can\\u2019t all travel together and this makes me sad. We also have people in the group who have babies. There\\u2019s one woman who\\u2019s carrying a baby. They also divide these people up because they drag people down. They can\\u2019t hunt and some of them don\\u2019t have survival skills - they feel more dependent. We also have got two toddlers in our group and they\\u2019re not even clothed. They\\u2019re running around naked and we\\u2019re trying to find small backpacks they can carry and some clothes that will fit them. They were dividing toddlers up and they\\u2019re not even with their parents - I have a feeling that they don\\u2019t have parents. They are just random toddlers, so they\\u2019re divided up into groups. So we leave separately. All this organizing and scavenging for equipment that we can carry on our backs is done before nightfall. We leave undercover of the dark. We know we cannot follow each other when we\\u2019re traveling in all these different groups because that will reduce the chances that we\\u2019ll survive. We need to be in smaller groups, so we won\\u2019t be spotted. Much of the dream is climbing over landscapes - meadows and cliffs and forests and swampy muddy things where we get completely filthy, but then find a body of water to wash in. There\\u2019s some skirmishes within the group where people are hungry and stealing each other\\u2019s food, including the toddlers. I have to take extra food away from kids - you know how kids will just randomly run around and graze, they\\u2019ll just shove food in their mouths as they\\u2019re going - I can\\u2019t let them do that. I have to keep them on the rations. So this is one dream memory of me opening up the toddlers hands and opening them up because they\\u2019ve got three times more of the berries than they\\u2019re supposed to have and I have to disperse these around. Part of me, as I\\u2019m doing this, feels regret because the child is so innocent - it\\u2019s a natural thing for a child to do and I feel a little sadness. I also feel a little bit of inner frustration that I even have a toddler that I have to do this with when we\\u2019re trying so hard to survive. So it\\u2019s an honest mixture of feelings that I have when I\\u2019m doing this. As we climb over more complicated and go through more dense flora and fauna, there\\u2019s a part where I\\u2019m aware that the group that is pursuing us and trying to kill us is actually on our trail. I realize they\\u2019re getting closer. I see this because I\\u2019ve climbed up high. There's an alarm in the middle of the night. I have to wake everybody up and get them to move. Some of them don\\u2019t want to and I\\u2019m like, pack your backpack! And some people don\\u2019t want to carry it, and I\\u2019m like if you don\\u2019t get up and move we\\u2019re going to have to leave you here! So I end up carrying three more packs than I\\u2019m supposed to. I end up getting everybody up, but there\\u2019s a couple of people that were groggy and wouldn\\u2019t wake up, they may be with the group, but I\\u2019m not sure and we have to move. Then we are in like the Amazon forest and we rappel up. We make it all the way up. It\\u2019s hard. We\\u2019re carrying toddlers in packs, passing things out, and we make it up to the top. We are safe now from that group. The landscape is still pretty densely forested. As we realize we\\u2019re safe, we\\u2019re able to spread out and rest a little bit. It was pretty onerous getting up there like that and so has the whole journey. So we take a couple days to rest. As I\\u2019m doing this and we\\u2019re setting up a makeshift camp, I realize that one of the other groups is close by and doing a similar thing. I sneak through the underbrush and I was about to make contact and ask the leader if they think it\\u2019s safe to join up just for the rest part, I see that my ex best friend is in that group, and now I don\\u2019t want to. I don\\u2019t want to have any communication with her. I\\u2019m glad she\\u2019s out of my life. She\\u2019s really hurt me and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re no longer friends. I don\\u2019t want her back in. She\\u2019s also narcissistic and I feel much better now that she\\u2019s out of my life. But there\\u2019s also some sadness with it too - when someone you love and care about betrays you, there\\u2019s also some sadness. So I feel this emotion going through my body. By this time, the other leader is aware of our group. Some of the members of their group have spread out far enough so everyone knows that we\\u2019re both here. So I end up having to suck it up as we get together with this other group for a meal. There\\u2019s people in that group who were friends of mine from before we had to leave our home, so I\\u2019m having this pleasant conversation with them. It\\u2019s a feeling of camaraderie. I\\u2019m aware that my friend knows I\\u2019m there. I also feel this thread of self satisfaction that she\\u2019s not one of the organizers - she didn\\u2019t have survival skills. Her skills were based on what she could suck off of others, so she\\u2019s demoted into that part of the social fabric of her group and I will truthfully admit to feeling a smack of satisfaction over that. The dream ends with us folding up our camps and putting them all back in our backpacks. You wouldn\\u2019t even know we were there. We\\u2019re brushing any vegetation that has been flattened with sticks with leaves on them and we continue on our trek.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Wall\\u201d The second dream, I\\u2019m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I\\u2019m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they\\u2019ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won\\u2019t be aware of what they\\u2019ve actually been doing. I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they\\u2019re hiding, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you even hiding that? It\\u2019s just a book.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I\\u2019m still a teenager in it, though, and I\\u2019ve moved out of their house but I\\u2019ve gone back for a visit. There\\u2019s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there\\u2019s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I\\u2019m looking at what she\\u2019s brought out. I see a couple things and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh! That was mine! I don\\u2019t remember hiding that and I didn\\u2019t even notice I was missing it.\\u201d So in the dream, we\\u2019re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don\\u2019t know what to do with mine. I guess I don\\u2019t have any pockets. I can\\u2019t seem to think in the dream, \\u201cOh why don\\u2019t I just take them with me?\\u201d Now I\\u2019m encumbered with the idea that the mom can\\u2019t see it and I\\u2019ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, \\u201cMom, Freya\\u2019s been hiding things in the wall.\\u201d Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she\\u2019s really disappointed in me that I\\u2019ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I\\u2019m thinking I don\\u2019t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I\\u2019m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Warpath\\u201d I\\u2019m living with a group of people outside on the plains, like a meadow but the earth is soft. We live and sleep outside. We\\u2019re on the way somewhere, we\\u2019re traveling. We\\u2019re tired and we need to stop and rest. We have adults as well as elderly people and some young kids in our group as well. I\\u2019d say when the dream starts there are probably about one hundred of us. We gather flower tops and berries and roots as well as small animals and that\\u2019s our food. I don\\u2019t get the small animals, but somebody does. We sleep on the grass, too. We\\u2019ve got wool blankets that we wrap ourselves in. There\\u2019s a group of indigenous people and the first time we come into contact with them, they have deep reddish brown horses that they\\u2019re riding. They just come in and they sweep through and it\\u2019s so quick and so violent that we\\u2019re in shock, we\\u2019re stunned, we don\\u2019t even react. Some of us just run and others are caught up by them or killed instantly. A couple of the women are carried off. We don\\u2019t know where to go to hide from them because there\\u2019s just more of this wide open plains area. So what we do instead is we\\u2019ve got these iron spikes, they\\u2019re like pegs that are about nine inches long. The next day we drive them into the ground around the outskirts of where we are so that the next time they come, they ones on foot will step on these and so will their horses and hopefully that will deter them from the mad sweep that they do really fast - they won\\u2019t be able to do that and that will give us a little bit more time to get away. All day long we spend driving these stakes into the ground so they stick up about six inches from the ground and about six feet apart, but they won\\u2019t be able to see them because they came at dusk last time and we know they\\u2019re going to do that again, probably at dusk. That night when we sit down to eat they don\\u2019t come, nothing happens. We eat, we sleep, we wake up again. A few nights pass like this. We\\u2019re pretty sure they\\u2019re going to come back. But during that period of time while we\\u2019re waiting, I have a few conversations with some of the kids, like the almost pubescent boys. There\\u2019s a group of three or four of them that sit there sullenly the way teenagers can be though they\\u2019re not yet teeangers. One of them in particular doesn\\u2019t like how the adults in the group are handling this at all. He\\u2019s becoming bitter and angry. I\\u2019m asking him how he thinks things should be done differently. He says that we should just get out of there. I say, \\u201cOkay, where would you have us go?\\u201d Then he doesn\\u2019t answer. There\\u2019s another one who is upset by his attitude and when I leave the conversation they get into a fist fight. Me and a few of the others go in and break it up. We know we need to do something differently and there\\u2019s that generally consensus starting to thread its way through our group. Now there\\u2019s not a hundred of us anymore, there\\u2019s about seventy because thirty were killed or taken the last time there was a raid. It\\u2019s that night that as soon as we finish eating, it\\u2019s just dusk when things are grey, when the natives come through again. They\\u2019re slowed down a little bit by the spikes but they quickly figure out they can go around them. More people do manage to get away and they only pick off about twenty this time. But this reduces us to fifty. The next day some of the men say they\\u2019re going to scout to see if there\\u2019s any other place we can go. They go into the forest. The forest is really thick and this is the issue. Do we keep moving forward on the plains or do we risk what\\u2019s in the forest? So that\\u2019s where a couple of men go to see if we can shelter there. But we also want to keep moving and we don\\u2019t want to just sit there hiding in fear which is where we might get stuck if we go into the forest. We\\u2019re thinking about what else we can do to defend ourselves from these raids. There\\u2019s also the elderly people who really aren\\u2019t capable of moving much farther at this point. We continue spending our days driving these iron spikes into the earth, trying to spread them around so we have a complete circle around us. That night when the men come back they say they\\u2019ve got good news and bad news. They tell us that they think there\\u2019s a different way of life moving forward from here, but we\\u2019ll have to change how we relate to each other as a group. One of them says, \\u201cEach woman has to pair up with a man and stay with him forever. The one man will be responsible for the survival of the one woman.\\u201d I think this is ridiculous. What\\u2019s going to happen to all these elderly people? There are no men for the elderly women, so who\\u2019s going to speak for them? I\\u2019m also disgusted and thinking, \\u201cEw there\\u2019s not one of you in this group that I want to stay with forever.\\u201d I\\u2019m suspicious about where this idea came from. The two of them maybe cooked this up together when they went into the forest and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a solution and won\\u2019t help the group survive as a group, it will just pick certain people out of it and leave the other ones to die. It really upsets me. That night the natives come through one more time. Only this time they only carry off one of the women. We\\u2019re sitting at a group of about forty-five people left. I\\u2019m avoiding picking any one of the men tonight. In fact, I\\u2019ve decided to stand up for the elderly and I will feed them at my table and give them seats there. The teeangers, the younger boys that I talked to the other night, also seem to agree with me and they moved their sleeping mats to where I\\u2019m sleeping with these eldelry people.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Waterfall\\u201d I\\u2019m getting ready to go for a hike with my friend. We are just meeting at a house, I think it\\u2019s mine, but it\\u2019s a house I\\u2019ve never lived in in real life. My kids are still asleep in it. Then the dream backtracks - it\\u2019s like it freezes there - to the night before. I was in my room with my son and my daughter. We were playing some kind of game. The tools for it looked like markers, but they were actually magnetic. When you applied them to the board, which looked like a whiteboard, they left a colored line even though they were magnets and not markers filled with any kind of liquid color. They were not felt-tipped. The tips were really hard. As we were playing with them, it wasn\\u2019t just a free flow creative \\u201clet\\u2019s draw this.\\u201d There was some kind of instruction that went with the game. It was working out fine. We had to do an algebra or conning - which is how you navigate a boat using the chart of the water. So we were following the instructions, doing the equations, then putting dots on the whiteboard with these magnetic markers. I guess it was taking a long time because the magnetic pens started to disintegrate, but my kids kept playing the game - they kept doing the calculations. I was trying to fix the magnetic pens - the lids had popped off of some of them and were in the bottom of the container. Then it started getting more complicated. So instead of being a set of ten and they all looked like they were different colors, it was like there were three sets. They were all different shapes and the lids were all different sizes. One of the lids looked like it fit on one purple pen, but it didn\\u2019t, it actually fit on the other purple one. They wouldn\\u2019t leave the dots on the board unless the lids and the ends were on properly. And then the wires that were part of the internal workings started coming out of the ends and I was trying to reassemble them. This tired my children after a while and they both went to sleep. My son was sleeping on the floor in my bedroom and my daughter was in a bed in her room. The night passed and I didn\\u2019t sleep, but my kids did. Then it was time for my hike. My friend was downstairs waiting for me. My son got up. He was just roaming around the house doing his own thing and making some food. My daughter was still sleeping. I wanted to leave her a note. I found one piece of paper that was all blacked out except for a small white square. I wrote on it with a pencil that I was going for a hike and then \\u201cxoxo\\u201d Love mom. I put it on her bed and then I realized that she found a box of old pictures and had stayed up quite late looking at them. She had a pile of her favorites. They were old family pictures that went beyond back to her family before she was born. I remember gently putting my hand on her hip and wiggling her a little bit to wake her up. She was kind of grumpy and when she realized she didn\\u2019t have to get up and I was just saying goodbye before going for my hike, she smiled and said, \\u201cLook at all the pictures.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s really nice.\\u201d They were taken care of. My friend and I changed, making sure we weren\\u2019t wearing anything bright. We were wearing some kind of green clothes to go on the hike so we wouldn\\u2019t stand out. We drove to the place we were hiking. It was a short drive away. The last thing I remember is we hiked quite a bit and it was an older forest. It reminds me of the forests in British Columbia. The trees are huge giant redwoods. We came to a waterfall and it was skinny and long and tall and it extended up into the sky, farther than my eyes could see. I just remember standing there feeling how big it was - how beautiful and how primal.\"],[\"\\u201cThe Whalers\\u201d In this dream, I\\u2019m part of someone else\\u2019s story. In the story, she has a childhood nightmare and she's written a story about it as a 20-something year old person. She\\u2019s taken the idea to go back through her own story in order to ease it or release it. I\\u2019m one of the people that is in the story with her. We go down to the shore of the lake and there\\u2019s a prearranged yellow inflatable raft - like an expensive Zodiac dinghy. There are three or four others with us. We get into the dinghy and we\\u2019re dressed for whaling. We are wearing rain gear and waterproof boots that are zipped into the rain gear. In the story, that I become aware of as we\\u2019re moving through the water, her father is a whaler. She has nightmares about some things that happened when she was a kid and went whaling with her father. We get closer to the area we\\u2019re supposed to be. At first I see everything from far away and I feel a fear and my heart rate is starting to build because out on the water, there are giant metal things. They look really small right now, but I\\u2019m already thinking that they are going to be really big and we are going to be really small once we get closer.I\\u2019ve never been whaling before. I question agreeing to go on this excursion. Obviously, we get closer. Then there\\u2019s this circle thing that other people in dinghies are gathering around. It\\u2019s like a large buoy. As we approach, we\\u2019re not allowed to go any further. We have to wait with these other people and we are just kind of circling around this really large bouey. The buoy is probably 30 feet tall - I can\\u2019t even see the top of it. We\\u2019re waiting for someone who has organized this to arrive. I notice that the other people in the dinghies all seem to be seniors. I wonder if they\\u2019re here as tourists. Finally the person that\\u2019s organized it arrives and I don\\u2019t see who they are. People start being able to leave out through the gate. We are now moving from that area out towards these large metal things. I feel really anxious and horrible as I can see there are hooks. I think to myself that the whales must have hung from these hooks. I\\u2019m just in the space of horror as she\\u2019s conversing with the organizer of this excursion. The dinghy gets closer to them, and as I thought, they are really large. We are quite small. The seniors in the other boats are pointing at them and oohing and awing. We circle around them. The dinghy goes a lot slower. Then we start to reverse the direction and go back. We get out of the dinghy at the buoy. Now there\\u2019s reef and shallow water vegetation and a pier. I just get out on foot and continue on.\"],[\"\\u201cThere\\u2019s Crime in Cafes\\u201d It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don\\u2019t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They\\u2019re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don\\u2019t even know how deep it goes. So there\\u2019s a self-serve area at one end - that\\u2019s the end that goes on and on and I don\\u2019t know how deep it goes. At the other end that\\u2019s open, it has long tables where you can take what you\\u2019ve selected and eat there with people. It\\u2019s packed. So, the dream opens and I\\u2019m sitting at a table. I\\u2019m not eating though. I\\u2019m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She\\u2019s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it\\u2019s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we\\u2019re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There\\u2019s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there\\u2019s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it\\u2019s finished, we go to the room next door. There\\u2019s another teacher in there that we\\u2019re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he\\u2019s trying to undermine the first teacher. We\\u2019ve gotten our lunch out and we\\u2019re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we\\u2019re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We\\u2019re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she\\u2019s still there. We share this information with her. She\\u2019s grateful. We tell her that we\\u2019ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll meet you here at the same time the next day.\\u201d So while I\\u2019m lining up to go and get food, first there\\u2019s this thing that happens with gum. There\\u2019s a direction by the cashier - it\\u2019s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, \\u201cWhy are they doing this? I don\\u2019t even want all this gum.\\u201d So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh! $50 for something I don\\u2019t even want.\\u201d However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I\\u2019m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don\\u2019t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I\\u2019m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he\\u2019s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no! That\\u2019s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!\\u201d He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn\\u2019t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I\\u2019ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don\\u2019t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There\\u2019s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It\\u2019s crowded and it\\u2019s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There\\u2019s people walking in the street. It\\u2019s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I\\u2019m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what\\u2019s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He\\u2019s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They\\u2019re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don\\u2019t know if they've purchased them or if he\\u2019s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what\\u2019s in the bag. They open it up and there\\u2019s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We\\u2019re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.\\u201d They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He\\u2019s giving it away and he\\u2019s giving it to children. He\\u2019s helping people. I think, \\u201cOh! Well he\\u2019s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they\\u2019re looking for this person?\\u201d So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn\\u2019t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren\\u2019t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I\\u2019m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she\\u2019s there. She\\u2019s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50\\u2019s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it\\u2019s got a rounded collar and she\\u2019s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, \\u201cWow, she\\u2019s dressed up really nicely. She\\u2019s in her good dress.\\u201d She doesn\\u2019t see me. In fact, we don\\u2019t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it\\u2019s her. She\\u2019s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she\\u2019s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I\\u2019m supposed to have, knowing that I can\\u2019t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she\\u2019s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I\\u2019d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can\\u2019t really. I wonder if she\\u2019s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He\\u2019s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He\\u2019s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.\"],[\"\\u201cTwisting by the Pool\\u201d I am going to a public swimming pool that has adult swim lengths. This is odd because I can't swim. In the dream, I am going to the adult swim lengths and the complex with the pool is located in a shopping mall. I swim my lengths and nobody else is there - it\\u2019s a private pool. Then afterwards, I shower at the pool. I put on something that I've brought with me that keeps your body warm and it\\u2019s very soft. The colors are neutral - grey. As I\\u2019m walking through the mall, my feet are cold because I\\u2019m wearing those shower shoes that are like flip flops. I notice in a store window a pair of shoes that are a bright indigo blue and they look really warm. They have a faux sheepskin lining and soft pleather or suede on the outside. They look like a moccasin. Suddenly, they\\u2019re on my feet. I look down and think, \\u201cOh, my feet feel so much better now.\\u201d As I continue to walk through the mall, the stores are all closed and there are no people around. I notice the restaurant where I used to work and think maybe I\\u2019ll stop in and see if I know anyone. So I walk into the restaurant. It\\u2019s not open and there are no customers or staff yet. I walk to the back and there\\u2019s a little place you can stand in front of the kitchen and behind where the customers can see. It\\u2019s a place where the staff stand and wait for the food to come out through the window. I\\u2019m just standing there. Then the owner comes out and he\\u2019s busy carrying some things. He has dishes in his hands and is stacking them up getting things ready for the day. He tells me to stand still. So I stand in between these two walls - one is to the kitchen and one is where the staff wait. He takes me by the wrists and he starts to spin me around in a circle. I look at him and am puzzled and say, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d He says, \\u201cJust trust me.\\u201d So he spins me around really quickly. I can feel the centripetal gravity pushing me away but he does have me by the wrists. Then there\\u2019s this moment where I can either fight it and try to slow down and pull my body towards the center or I can let go and just trust that it will be fine. I let go and I feel something that was hardwired tight in the middle of me snap. There are a few more moments of going around and around and he says, \\u201cThere, you\\u2019ve got it now.\\u201d He slows down. He must know I\\u2019m dizzy because I have no equilibrium, no balance. He tells me, \\u201cJust put your head down for a minute.\\u201d I bend my knees and come into a child\\u2019s pose with my forehead on the ground. I\\u2019m just allowing everything to spin. I feel weightless. There\\u2019s some kind of different energy running through my body. I feel the dizziness pass enough that I think it\\u2019s okay to stand up and I do. I am looking around. I can see the staff are in the restaurant now and they\\u2019re all busy at their own stations setting up and preparing for the day. Then I\\u2019m really self conscious and notice what I\\u2019m wearing. I think it looks like pajamas and slippers. I don\\u2019t want anybody to see me. So I\\u2019m waiting until nobody is standing by the side door to exit out of there. This couple comes up and it\\u2019s not clear what the woman wants, but she\\u2019s asking me for help. I\\u2019m thinking I should just spin her around so that she\\u2019s not worried about it anymore. I feel like there\\u2019s a moment when I tried that, but she\\u2019s too frail. So I tell her we should go out for a walk. They come with me. All of a sudden the owner is also there on the walk, although I don\\u2019t remember inviting him and I don\\u2019t know why he's there. I look down at my feet and legs. There\\u2019s a thick layer of snow on the ground and I think I\\u2019m going to freeze. Then all of a sudden I\\u2019m wearing the winter coat that I used to wear when I was pregnant, so it\\u2019s big. I\\u2019m not cold anymore. I look over at the woman and now she\\u2019s improperly dressed and her teeth are chattering and her skin is turning blue. I think she\\u2019s got hypothermia. I tell her to come over and say, \\u201cWe need to go back and you need to get inside this coat with me.\\u201d She says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s no way I\\u2019ll fit in there.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes you will. I wore this coat when I was pregnant. There\\u2019s definitely room for two people.\\u201d So I tell her to get in the coat and I put her arms in the same sleeves as my arms. Now I\\u2019ve got boots on and I tell her to step on top of my feet. She\\u2019s wooden though. I tell her, \\u201cLook, listen to this rhythm. 1, 2, 1, 2. Move your legs at the same time: 1, 2, 1, 2.\\u201d She starts to get it. Now I can hear music playing and I say, \\u201cOh! Do you know this song?\\u201d I think she might because it\\u2019s an older song. As I\\u2019m saying that, I realize there was old music that I don\\u2019t know but my parents would know playing in the background the whole time, but I didn't really notice. I wonder if they noticed. I look over at the owner and I say, \\u201cHey, you probably know this song.\\u201d He listens for a moment and says, \\u201cNo. What is it?\\u201d I tell him that it\\u2019s, \\u201cTwisting by the Pool\\u201d by Dire Straits. The music gets a little louder as though it warmed up to me recognizing it. I say, \\u201cLook, move to the rhythm of the music, 1, 2, 1, 2, twisting by the pool!\\u201d Now I\\u2019m singing it to her and I can feel her relaxing as she thaws out. She starts walking to the rhythm of the music and we\\u2019re okay. Now we\\u2019re trudging through the snow. The owner has a briefcase now and he starts picking up papers that are all over the snow. He\\u2019s putting the papers in his briefcase. He\\u2019s hurrying and trying to rush everyone into the store. I say, \\u201cit\\u2019s okay, I\\u2019ve got this. We\\u2019ll catch up with you later.\\u201d He says, \\u201cGood, because they\\u2019re supposed to be meeting me for dinner at my house and there\\u2019s wine.\\u201d The wine is really important. Now I\\u2019m feeling confused because I thought I was taking them back to the restaurant. He gives me the address and says, \\u201cYou need to bring them there. This is my house.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m feeling uncomfortable again. I don\\u2019t really want to go to his house, but I have this woman I have to take there and I\\u2019m still wearing what I feel looks like pajamas. Now the dream starts to break down a bit. I\\u2019m intending to take them to his house and think I\\u2019ll end up going there.\"],[\"\\u201cWheat\\u201d I\\u2019m eating supper with my friend who is a dietician and her family. She has four kids and her husband is there, too. She\\u2019s describing to me the benefits of a plant based diet and invites me to stay for supper. I agree because I think it\\u2019s going to be all plant based food, but instead, she dishes out pasta like spaghetti that already has tomato sauce mixed in with it, and starts putting it on everybody\\u2019s plates. I tell her, \\u201cNo thank you, I can\\u2019t eat wheat.\\u201d She says, \\u201cOkay, hmm, that\\u2019s all we have.\\u201d I say,\\u201dThat\\u2019s fine. I\\u2019m used to not eating anything as opposed to eating wheat and suffering through the effects of it for weeks to come.\\u201d When her family is finished eating I notice that hardly any of her kids ate all the pasta. She just scrapes it all into the garbage. I wonder why she\\u2019s feeding her family stuff like this when she\\u2019s been advocating this plant based diet and also creating such waste. I find this puzzling.\"],[\"\\u201cWooden Ship\\u201d In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It\\u2019s between 40 and 60 feet long. It\\u2019s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he\\u2019s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it\\u2019s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It\\u2019s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It\\u2019s got debris filtered from the water as it\\u2019s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There\\u2019s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I\\u2019m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven\\u2019t gone all the way out into the body of water. We\\u2019re still going through the channel. I\\u2019m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: \\u201cRandy, it\\u2019s too shallow here, we\\u2019ll never make it through! We\\u2019re going to run aground!\\u201d He says, \\u201cNo, no, we\\u2019ll be fine. I\\u2019ve done this before.\\u201d He\\u2019s maneuvering the ship and I\\u2019m positive it\\u2019s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you\\u2019re going to scrape your keel. You\\u2019re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don\\u2019t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe the ship just didn't run aground.\\u201d He says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s because it has no keel.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! So how are we staying balanced?\\u201d Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it\\u2019s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, \\u201cOh, that explains that.\\u201d The dream speeds through the day on the water like it\\u2019s just a minute and we\\u2019re coming back through this same channel. Now it\\u2019s time to tie up. I\\u2019m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that\\u2019s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I\\u2019m climbing up, I realize it\\u2019s not attached to the wall and it\\u2019s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn\\u2019t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I\\u2019m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it\\u2019s a platform, like walking the plank. It\\u2019s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He\\u2019s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I\\u2019m okay. Now I\\u2019m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I\\u2019m standing there talking to him saying, \\u201cHow is this boat balanced without a keel?\\u201d He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it\\u2019s made of wood so it must be light plus it\\u2019s buoyant. There\\u2019s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It\\u2019s actually a hole. I\\u2019m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn\\u2019t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.\"],[\"1.

I\\u2019ve been on vacation somewhere and have just come back to the house. Josh is with me. He\\u2019s dragging his feet and is not excited about being back in this house. He keeps complaining about it not feeling like home and being too big. He\\u2019s also the only male in the house. The other people I\\u2019ve let the house out to are all women. When we walk in the door, there\\u2019s a bunch of women, all blonde and middle aged, very nice. They\\u2019re doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen area with the concrete countertops. It\\u2019s very open with windows that look out. I realize I have some things to clean up and am looking through drawers trying to find towels to mop up the mess. Then my friend, Nani from high school who I haven\\u2019t seen since she left high school her Junior year to move to California. She\\u2019s wandering around and is not talking a lot, she doesn\\u2019t have a whole lot to say. I go and follow her to the space she\\u2019s occupying. She\\u2019s taken up the den or the parlor. She\\u2019s put a bed in it and it\\u2019s super cute, I love the way she decorated it. It\\u2019s open to the rest of the house but you do have to go around a corner set of stairs to get to it. I\\u2019m wondering how she feels about not having a lot of privacy. I say hi to her and go back into the kitchen. Josh is there moping and sitting on the steps. The stairs are kind of crazy, a really big set of stairs with no railing on one side. You go up the stairs and hit a landing then turn and go up a second set of stairs. The second set of stairs is between two walls so there are rooms on either side at that point. The first part has no railing at all. We go up and our bedroom is up there. He\\u2019s sitting on the stairs and I think he comes up the stairs with me. I\\u2019m noticing as I go up into what would be our bedroom how empty it feels and it doesn\\u2019t actually feel like home. There are other bedrooms where other people are staying as well. The house is so big and it seems like it keeps getting bigger or there are more doors. I come back down the stairs and walk back through the kitchen and dining room area. The dining room has a big dining table and a big chandelier over the top. Off the dining room is another hallway and there are more rooms back there. We walk back there. This is where the two blonde ladies are saying, they have a space back here. It\\u2019s pretty comfortable. I\\u2019m looking and I realize the panel has a door and I suddenly see it. Josh is still moping somewhere and he\\u2019s on his phone and complaining about how he wants to go home or he wants to go where people know him. All I can think is we have this great place and there\\u2019s an adventure to be had because I just realized there\\u2019s a doorway into something else and he\\u2019s not ready. The words that keep coming through my head are, \\u201cYou\\u2019re just really immature and moping like a little boy so why don\\u2019t you do that because clearly you need to do that. I\\u2019m going in through this door to see what\\u2019s there.\\u201d I open up the door. Initially I just poke my head in to see what it is. I can see round hobbit doors and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is a portal into another realm, I can totally tell.\\u201d I look over my shoulder and see Josh being mopey and sad. I leave him and go in. it\\u2019s this hallway with all these doors off it and also a common area which is basically under where the stairs would be. The wood grain seems a bit shimmery and mirage-like. I walk in and run into all these women, but they\\u2019re not human. They\\u2019re all different kinds of fae. They\\u2019re talking to me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHi, I didn\\u2019t know this was here. Where is this? What is this? How are you staying at this house?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh we just rent with you, too.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d They\\u2019re super happy to show me the place. There\\u2019s nor weirdness about me as a human being there. One of them has bronze skin and curly hair, one of them has a baby. The one with a baby is the one who talks with me the most. She keeps dropping her baby. She sets him down and he sits for a little bit but then his head gets heavy and he flops over backwards. He nails his head on the floor which is concrete but he doesn\\u2019t cry. She just picks him up and sets him up again in another precarious position. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you want to put him there, he\\u2019s going to flop over again.\\u201d Sure enough he falls again and smacks his head really hard and fusses a little bit, but she calms him. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s good for him but she doesn\\u2019t seem concerned so I just leave it be. She\\u2019s the one who explains to me who they all are. She keeps calling herself and the other people/fae the name but I can\\u2019t pronounce it so I just forget. Then I start asking her, \\u201cWhat are you all doing here?\\u201d When I had walked from the dining into that back room the house started to feel weird and I told her, \\u201cOh there\\u2019s an entity in this house and I need to smudge and clear it out.\\u201d Now that I\\u2019m talking to this woman beneath the stairs in fae land or wherever I am, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh yeah, we\\u2019re here because we keep that thing at bay. But you guys feel it more in that part of the house.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh well, how do I get rid of it? It doesn\\u2019t need to stay here and I know I can get rid of it. Whatever the dark pall that is hanging over the house just needs to go.\\u201d I think Josh is depressed and that\\u2019s part of why he\\u2019s depressed. She says, \\u201cOh well, you can clean it out, but we mostly do the work of keeping it out in here.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay awesome. I\\u2019m still going to try and get rid of it because it\\u2019s not necessary and it doesn\\u2019t feel good and it makes the rest of the house feel really yucky and uncomfortable to be in.\\u201d Then the dream ends here because I don\\u2019t remember coming out of that part of the house, I think I just woke up. I have the sense that everything is okay and this part of the house is where I want to be and I don\\u2019t know if I want to return to the other side.\"],[\"A man in his car. He\\u2019s stoned. He\\u2019s found out that it\\u2019s illegal to possess any drugs here. He starts driving really, really fast. He drives into an ambush of men in army camouflage combat gear. They are pointing machine guns at him and shooting at him from all directions. Some are hiding high in trees, others in the grass, others standing, some crouching near and far. He is bloodied. He has a gun and is shooting at everybody. It\\u2019s a big, bloody, messy scene. Somehow he survives. He\\u2019s been making jewelry, amulets, very fine and delicate. Hidden inside of some of the amulets are drugs. There is a woman who is trying to uncover him and reveal his illegal activities. They\\u2019re at a fine cocktail or dinner party. People are holding his jewelry and admiring it. She\\u2019s trying to figure out who knows about the drugs. She\\u2019s closed out by everybody. Another scene: a forest, a large tree stump, wide and tall, about four and half feet tall and very wide. The stump is set up as an altar to Judas. I was going to do a ceremony for releasing the shame and betrayal of Judas. Ursula appears uninvited, adding things to the altar. Gemma appears with dried roses for the altar. Other women who were a part of the Priestess School who I don\\u2019t recognize arrive. I\\u2019m upset that they\\u2019re taking this ritual for themselves and somewhat including me but not acknowledging me.\"],[\"A new symptom started appearing in those with the virus, which was a rash.\"],[\"A really sinister feeling deram. I\\u2019m at a retreat center. The lodging is more like a dormitory, almost like Esalen with multiple bunk beds in each room. All the rooms are lined up in one long building. There\\u2019s a priest figure who\\u2019s either leading the retreat is a guru for this retreat center community. He\\u2019s a combination of different energies, including Swamiji. There are quite a few people gathered, some remind me of people from high school and others from college. There\\u2019s also my husband and me. My husband is upset and distant from me. He\\u2019s talking with other circles of people. I go into my room that I share with a group of people. I am witness to a murder and brainwashing. I\\u2019m not entirely brainwashed though, so I see it for what it is. It\\u2019s really disturbing. The priest is there. His assistant is with him. I feel sick to my stomach and don\\u2019t want to remember what I saw. They manipulate this young man, making him into a zombie-like state, then kiss all the life out of him. The people continue to do their things - folding clothes, brushing teeth, getting dressed. I hear the priest and his assistant talking about what to do with the body. The assistant says, \\u201cThis may have to be the last one for awhile because there might be some questions about the accident.\\u201d They plan to frame his death as a fall down the cliffs. I try to behave like the others to get away. I have a sense they\\u2019ve picked up on my more aware and attentive consciousness. I\\u2019m desperately looking for my husband to tell him because he\\u2019s one of the only ones I feel I can confide in now. I see him sitting on a bench with a small group of people. I want to draw him away so I can speak with him, but he doesn\\u2019t want to leave this group. He may somehow be involved with the deception somehow. The scene shifts. It seems like a month or so has passed. The same people are here. But now they are circulating around higher society at a symphony gala. They\\u2019re still doing the same sinister plotting and killing. Somehow they end up in the same location as me. I cross paths with them in the kitchen. More time has passed or maybe this is before. I\\u2019m going to a little library for a book reading and meditation. It\\u2019s in a neat geodesic dome. There\\u2019s an attic area upstairs with a woman who deceived my husband. The library has a collection of rare spiritual and magical books - not what you\\u2019d normally find in a library. This has been built as someone\\u2019s home and then later turned into a place for the public. I\\u2019m meeting with a small group of women. We\\u2019re sitting on the couch waiting for somebody. I recognize them from waking life, but they are distinctly different from their waking life appearance - shorter hair, heavier, odd voice, strange style of dress. They decide to begin. Usually I\\u2019m the one to begin, but Beth and Sherry begin instead. Beth takes out a long curved brown dried leaf with an incense stick and a white piece of copal. But then Shnati smiles and pops the copal in her mouth like a piece of candy. They light the incense and begin. Somebody sings a song. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m setting up a beach blanket with my mom, sister and son. It\\u2019s a lovely day. I\\u2019m watching a young Indian mother and her child play in the water. She\\u2019s round and full in her body, so is he. They go out into the waves during a lull. Others are swimming in the water. Then suddenly a big wave rises up out of the ocean. The wave swallows the mother and son, then it rushes up to our towel. It washes my Kindle away along with my bags, shoes and son. I\\u2019m scrambling waiting for the waves to calm so I can find everything and hoping the water returns it all. My son is okay. My Kindle is buried partially under the sand, still in its case. It\\u2019s okay. We move our towels up where there is a young gay couple on their towel. We\\u2019re close to them, but we will all move soon and have more space between us.\"],[\"A store after hours. It\\u2019s been closed for a while now. People are gathering here at night, unlocking the door and huddling close inside. Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I\\u2019m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I\\u2019m not really welcome because I\\u2019m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won\\u2019t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I\\u2019m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.\"],[\"A white guy has a bunch of black bugs on his face\\u2026.I see as he leans over close to me\\u2026.This is part of a bigger cleaning process, it is good he is doing this, allowing the bugs to be on his face, this will make it easier to get rid of them\\u2026.I admire him, even though it is gross, I want him to stay away\\u2026.\"],[\"A white room. My ex Rory was outside the door and I was inside. I was creating art or something on the floor. I had pot that was spilling everywhere and red wine, but I didn\\u2019t want him to see it. There was another part to the dream where we were in a house and having sex with each other but by extension with other people in other rooms but it wasn\\u2019t a graphic or sexual even. It was matter of fact. I could be where I was and be experiencing what they were experiencing. I was just experiencing people. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it.\"],[\"A woman and I are with some guys\\u2026.They have resources to help us\\u2026.But they are in charge of shows and displays, welcoming people?....Like they are airline attendants, with suitcases in a very plain blue color\\u2026.We go along, we have to, but it is not what we need\\u2026.Lots of waste is going on\\u2026.a sense of mild frustration and confusion here\\u2026.Something about water?....\"],[\"A woman is doing something, and there is a problem, things get slow\\u2026.But then it is ok again, things are good, all are happy\\u2026.Later, someone sends a box of my stuff back to me\\u2026.Clothes, books, and other personal items\\u2026.in a brown cardboard box\\u2026.that is ok with me\\u2026.\"],[\"A woman is getting ready for sex, and she slips the guy a condom in a little square foil package\\u2026.This is his to do\\u2026.Later, the woman is in a little boat, floating in a flooded living room\\u2026.She goes to get a black gun that is placed on the mantle of the fireplace\\u2026.\"],[\"A woman is in distress of some kind\\u2026.She is in a situation, like the filming of an ad, and it is going fine one way, but not how she wants it to go\\u2026.A phrase or motto for the ad is said, but it does not really apply to her\\u2026.I know the difference\\u2026.\"],[\"A year ago I had this wild dream that something horrible like this was about to happen.\"],[\"A young beautiful woman in a black lace outfit comes downstairs\\u2026.to me?....No, to some other team working on a project\\u2026.although I think she wants to come to me instead?....later, someone cuts up a ripe peach, and gives me a piece\\u2026.at another point, I have a bird, in my hand perhaps?....I let it go outside the house I\\u2019m in, it quickly joins a flock of other birds, who fly fast through the air\\u2026.it is beautiful, makes me happy to see it\\u2026.then, a tough guy goes underwater, lets an alligator grab him by the hand (I am now in the guy\\u2019s perspective, and I am surprised the alligator\\u2019s bite does not hurt more, and surprised I can stay underwater so long), then gets two alligators together, pins them against a wall, and points a revolver gun at them, to kill them as nuisances and dangers to others\\u2026.But the gun does not work, it will not fire, and he has to let the alligators go\\u2026.\"],[\"A young woman, like a sales person in a store, is doing something to help people\\u2026.But they take advantage of her\\u2026.She has three weird tattoos on her face\\u2026.Other people put them there, to mark her\\u2026.I look closely, the tattoos are not well done\\u2026.One has lots of little orange lines\\u2026.I feel sorry for her\\u2026.\"],[\"About the work I did pre pandemic\"],[\"About the world crumbling.

We\\u2019re inside a large room. She\\u2019s standing up higher and radiant in her pregnant fullness. She starts to feel labor beginning. We\\u2019re watching and singing and holding space. At one point, she\\u2019s in a smaller room. I hear her say that she pooped and a woman says, \\u201cgood, this is great, this is part of it.\\u201d Then another woman who sounds like my mother shames her for pooping. She says it\\u2019s not a good thing. I wish I was there to be another voice of support. She comes out of that room, clean and very much in the fire of crowning birth. I can see a redness and opening between her legs. She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We\\u2019re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She\\u2019s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby. I think I would not be happy if I were not the first to hold my baby. We all look and see that it is a healthy baby. We bring the baby back to Talia with love and devotion.\"],[\"Amid a variety of activities by different people, I realize that a combination of observing, time, and reasoning can figure out lots of things\\u2026.That is the path towards getting things better settled\\u2026.Somehow I am aware that Hart has gone to a hotel in the afternoon where his wife checked in earlier in the morning, and now they have accidentally encountered each other\\u2026.This is a bad thing, they have other people with them, now Hart knows of her sexual affairs, infidelities\\u2026.Later, I am sitting in a chair, floating high above the ocean\\u2026.There are a few ships below, people swimming, maybe a beach nearby\\u2026.But I am very high in the air, and nothing in particular is holding me up\\u2026.I suddenly wonder, how did I get here?....How am I able to float along like this?....What if I start to fall?....there seems to be a gentle inertia keeping me going for now, but my thoughts become anxious\\u2026.\"],[\"An empty boat. A journey over the ocean or maybe just a bay. Salt water. I\\u2019m watching a person who has never captained a boat. They are gathering a crew. I know the end of the story. The chosen captain doesn\\u2019t survive the journey. I\\u2019m watching to see how this happens, wondering if the captain is murdered or dies of natural causes or has an accident of some kind. The crew is assembled. The boat is beautiful but totally empty. We all get on the boat. As the people move up and down the different levels of the boat, I'm peering through windows. There are people carrying small lanterns to light their way, others writing in journals, others sleeping, others watching the stars. I\\u2019m waiting to see where the captain is going and what will happen to the captain. Maybe by watching, it may shift the way things develop. Maybe the captain will survive. But there is no way to know. Then, a bathtub with a little girl in the tub, prepubescent, learning about puberty. Hanna is in one room. Rose is in another room. Another woman is also present. Hanna is very light in her questioning. Rose is very certain in her teaching, talking about the first blood and how to measure a ship to be as clear as possible from the beginning. Do we measure from end to end, or only the livable portion of a ship? She\\u2019s talking about how to maintain and care for the pubic hair without having razor bumps. Rose says, \\u201cWell, of course you massage first for a while.\\u201d She says this as if everyone should know. I feel ashamed that I do not know and remind myself to remember when I wake up.\"],[\"An old building made of stone with old fixtures. It\\u2019s two maybe three stories with big wide stairs. I\\u2019m walking up to the second floor. There\\u2019s something about water, learning about the power and magic of water. There\\u2019s a feeling of conflict, misunderstanding, fear, manipulation, and yet an attempt at forming a common goal - a goal of learning then teaching. The power goes out in the building. Then, we\\u2019re in the hallway sweeping up dirt and hair that has fallen off people\\u2019s heads over the years. In another room, a class is beginning. Someone hands me an amulet of lava stone with red jewels and hammered iron. I wear it during the class. The class is a movement almost like yoga. I wear the amulet to charge it with power. I\\u2019m given two other amulets to wear and keep with me and charge up as well.\"],[\"Ana and I are together with her son. We are on an adventure of some kind. We\\u2019re driving and we pull over because someone has to use the bathroom. We\\u2019re in the mountains and we find a rest stop. At the rest stop are a bunch of cattle and they\\u2019re all having babies. It\\u2019s funny because they aren\\u2019t standing up and birthing. They\\u2019ve dug holes and are dropping the babies into holes. Ana\\u2019s son is watching the whole thing and so am I. We are completely fascinated by all this birth happening all around us. The dream switches. Now I\\u2019m with my dad, siblings, and kids. We\\u2019re in a place that kind of reminds me of a Chinatown. We\\u2019re trying to find someplace to eat. We\\u2019re walking down the street and there are a lot of options. I think it\\u2019s during pandemic times because everyone has masks on and there are not a lot of places open. This part of the dream gets kind of fuzzy. I don\\u2019t know exactly what we\\u2019re going after. Funny things are happening at the restaurant when we go to order. I\\u2019m not hungry because there\\u2019s food I can\\u2019t eat. Then we find this other stand and the kitchen is gross with cockroaches everywhere and the smell of rancid oil. Then the dream switches. I am with a group of people. I only recognize one person and it\\u2019s my high school classmate. We\\u2019re a bunch of high schoolers. We\\u2019re at horse stables. There\\u2019s a European woman with an accent. She\\u2019s teaching us how to be around horses. First she does a demonstration in the arena. All of the horses are black. She\\u2019s riding the horse with no saddle, no bit, no reins. She\\u2019s showing us how to ride, basically dressage. She\\u2019s showing us and saying, \\u201cThis is very easy.\\u201d I\\u2019m talking to the group and am like, \\u201cNone of that is easy. I\\u2019ve done dressage and it\\u2019s not easy to get a horse to do perfect gaits and stop on perfect points, especially without a saddle and bit.\\u201d The woman comes out and says, \\u201cOkay, now it\\u2019s your turn.\\u201d Everyone files into the arena. At the far end is a stable with like twenty black horses. Everyone goes and gets a horse. I\\u2019m actually excited about being around the horses, but for some reason I don\\u2019t go out right away. All these classmates of mine have horses. They\\u2019re doing the hand motions that she\\u2019s showing them. There are a bunch of other trainers, men, who are keeping an eye on everyone. I\\u2019m horrified now because it\\u2019s so crowded and it\\u2019s so loud and there\\u2019s no way in hell any horse would stand there for all this noise, chaos and inexperienced people trying to get them to do things. I think the horses are put away and it\\u2019s time for us to stretch. We\\u2019re sitting in the dirt of the arena. They\\u2019re asking me how to stretch the pelvis. I\\u2019m showing them how to do a straddle and rock the pelvis forward. A man walks by and I don\\u2019t know if he\\u2019s our teacher or a trainer or a chaperone. He takes over from me and shows everyone how to do different stretches. Everyone follows along. Our low backs get stretched. I\\u2019m folded all the way over with my head resting on my legs and thinking, \\u201cWow, my low back has never been this flexible. Huh.\\u201d Then the dream switches again. I\\u2019m parked somewhere. I leave my car to go do something. When I come back, my ex-boyfriend is parked next to me. He\\u2019s parked crooked so I can\\u2019t open the passenger side door if I wanted to. In fact, I don\\u2019t know how he\\u2019s getting out of the car because he hasn\\u2019t left himself very much room. He gets out and he has all his stuff and he\\u2019s super happy to see me. I\\u2019m shocked and have no idea why he\\u2019s there. He walks around and puts his stuff in the back seat of my car and says, \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? Why are you here and what are we doing?\\u201d I have no idea how we\\u2019re suddenly here together in a parking lot in a tropical space. He says, \\u201cCome, I want to show you this island.\\u201d It\\u2019s an island where people have to boat out to live there. All the houses are gigantic. There\\u2019s an estuary that cuts the island in half so salt water flows from one end of the island to the other. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis island gets demolished by a hurricane.\\u201d It\\u2019s tropical. There\\u2019s a mix of super rich and super poor people. As we float down this center estuary I\\u2019m noticing huge houses and a huge building for a swap meet with secondhand stuff because everyone on the island reuses everything. I go into that building and look at all the items in the swap meet. I\\u2019m watching an old guy haggle for a tablecloth.

I do not have a body, I am not taking up any space, I am just watching it all happen. There is a black man and his two daughters. He is showing them how to ride trains for free because they\\u2019re really poor and they don\\u2019t have money for a ticket. So he showed them how to get on these subway trains for free and ride where you need to ride it. They\\u2019re riding on the outside of the train. His daughters are maybe 9 and 11 or maybe 11 or 14. I\\u2019m watching them. I\\u2019m not even on the train. I\\u2019m watching from outside the train. This train is underground, kind of like a subway because there are walls around it and me. They\\u2019re on this train and it\\u2019s going in one direction. They are on a trip and traveling cross-country. But his daughters get very fearless and bold. They decide to do train hopping and take what he\\u2019s taught them and get on any train they want. Sure enough, they\\u2019re on this train and they see another train passing them and going in the opposite direction. They were heading one direction because they were heading across the country and then the daughters hop trains and the father is upset. He says, \\u201cHey don\\u2019t do that, now we\\u2019re going in the wrong direction plus you could kill yourselves.\\u201d But it\\u2019s too late. The daughters are already on another train, so he has to hop it and get on with them, so he doesn\\u2019t lose them. So he gets on this other train. Now they go from being on top of the train down inside the train where there\\u2019s other people. There are all kinds of other people on this train. All kinds of ethnicities, races. It\\u2019s a mix of white, black, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander - everybody and all kinds. They\\u2019re all quirky people. They have their own idiosyncrasies. They\\u2019re each working through some sort of story - they\\u2019re living their own personal story out on this train and they\\u2019re kind of interacting with each other, but it\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re bouncing off of each other. The interactions aren\\u2019t particularly conscious. It\\u2019s more like they\\u2019re each doing their own thing. They run into each other and it\\u2019s sort of like a pinball where their actions, thoughts and stories are mainly about themselves, but they bounce off each other and have an interaction. In particular, there\\u2019s a couple that I can see and am following - a white man with a mustache and shorter hair and with his partner/wife - I can\\u2019t tell what kind of relationship they\\u2019re in. The dad and the two daughters are in the mix now. I\\u2019m watching them. Now that the direction they\\u2019re going has now changed completely, he\\u2019s realizing they need clothes and supplies and food. They\\u2019re going around the train and getting some supplies. Everybody is pretty friendly and are like, \\u201cYeah, we all don\\u2019t have a lot, but here I have this one coat or this shirt.\\u201d It seems like everybody on this train doesn\\u2019t have a lot of money, but they do have some resources. Everything they\\u2019re offering up has been well-used. But the daughters need clothes, shoes and food. And the dad\\u2019s like, yeah I could use a jacket. So everybody is offering what they\\u2019ve got. Then back to this one man with this woman. He\\u2019s wearing a flannel shirt that\\u2019s opened and jeans with rips. He knows what he\\u2019s wanting to do - he\\u2019s very focused. The train has now gone out from a tunnel to outside. I can see outside now. I\\u2019m in the train and outside the train, both simultaneously. I\\u2019m observing what\\u2019s happening in the train and outside of the train. So the train is outside and stops suddenly. Part of the tracks go through this person\\u2019s yard. Their yard looks like a big farm. The train dead stops in the middle. My thought when I see that is, \\u201cUgh, how inconvenient to have a train in the middle of your front lawn. Then all the people start getting off the train. They\\u2019re milling about the lawn of this farm. It\\u2019s a big property. Then some of the people are going into the farmhouse and I\\u2019m watching them wondering, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s the owner of this house? They're probably not going to like this.\\u201d Then that one man and the woman go into the house and they start looking for supplies. I see this other man, he\\u2019s a big beefy burly man, almost like a bodybuilder type guy. He\\u2019s with a woman, too, and she\\u2019s really big, maybe 200lbs and she has a backpack on. They see that the farmer has a horse that\\u2019s in the front lawn and they climb up on the horse to ride it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that horse\\u2019s back is going to break. That\\u2019s too much weight - bodybuilder, large woman plus backpack.\\u201d I see the horse walking, then trotting, then galloping. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god!\\u201d The horse is fighting the whole time. The farmer comes out and yells at them to get off his horse, which is something I would have done. But the thought that registers in my brain is: \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe they know how to ride a horse.\\u201d With the whole bodybuilding persona, it doesn\\u2019t seem like something they would know how to do. Then I go back to the inside of this house where this other man is - the one with the mustache. He has found jewelry making supplies and he\\u2019s making jewelry. It\\u2019s gorgeous, raw stones and he\\u2019s soldering the silver. He\\u2019s making a pendant. It\\u2019s not his supplies, but the farmer\\u2019s that he found in this house. I can see this happening through a sliding glass door. Then I am inside the house. This black man and his daughters are in there, too, and they\\u2019re rummaging for food. The other people on the train are milling about, too, doing all kinds of things. The train has stopped because it\\u2019s stuck. But eventually, you hear the conductor yelling, \\u201cHey, the train is back together. You need to get on. We\\u2019re going to go. We\\u2019re going to continue on.\\u201d So some of the people get back on the train, and some of the people are like, \\u201cNo, we like it here. We\\u2019re going to stay here.\\u201d (not necessarily in the farmhouse, but in this area). The train continues on in its direction while another train passes in the opposite direction. I think the black man and his daughters get on the train going the opposite direction so they can get back to where they had originally set out to go to. Then the dream switches completely. Again I am an observer. I\\u2019m watching women I know - they are performers. It\\u2019s kind of like a circus. There\\u2019s a big tent. They\\u2019re in a dressing room in the back where everyone is talking. There\\u2019s lots of love and connection between all these women. They\\u2019re definitely family, they get along, some are actually blood family. It\\u2019s not a hierarchy because not just one person is in charge, but there is a synergy with one person who directs things. Things get done around her direction, but nobody has more or less power than her. This is fascinating for me to watch as she gives directions about how to do their show. It\\u2019s not actually directions. She\\u2019s asking who wants to do what - \\u201cDo you want to do this part of the show? Are we going to take a break?\\u201d Then there is an announcement that this man is coming in and he\\u2019s going to be a guest spot and do part of the show. I see all of the women perk up. Some are like, \\u201cWell, is he handsome?\\u201d But I see the woman who is the glue and directs things. She gets that look in her eye like, \\u201cHmm, I don\\u2019t know if I trust this.\\u201d So everybody leaves the dressing room and goes out in the circus tent area where there\\u2019s definitely a crowd of people watching. They\\u2019re watching a show in a huge copper bathtub, big enough for multiple people to be in. The man comes in and he\\u2019s going to do his show in the bathtub. It reminds me of synchronized swimming and people who act like mermaids, so you can watch through the glass as they do this show under the water. So this man is doing all of it, but normally the show is done completely naked - all of the women are completely naked while they do it. He\\u2019s doing it with his clothes on and the women are wondering, \\u201cWhat is going on? Why is he doing it that way?\\u201d So the woman who directs and has some good mothering energy goes into the tub to do part of the show and she\\u2019s naked as usual. The man who has all of his clothes on has an assistant and she has all her clothes on, too. The woman that is directing things goes in and does her part. You can tell there is tension and this attempted shaming that she\\u2019s in there naked. It\\u2019s totally beautiful to watch her, but then there\\u2019s this man and this other woman who have their clothes. They look so weird, they can barely move because their clothes are dragging them down, especially in contrast to the woman who\\u2019s naked. Some of the other women come in and start doing the dance in the water and they\\u2019re naked. But then you see some sort of official come in and say, \\u201cYou have to wear clothes now.\\u201d So they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, we have to put our clothes on.\\u201d They do put their clothes on. The person who says, \\u201cyou have to put your clothes on\\u201d is the husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing things. He says it because he says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t dance with that man naked,\\u201d because now in the show, they\\u2019re supposed to dance together. The husband of the woman who\\u2019s directing the show is feeling jealousy or protectiveness and he\\u2019s saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t dance with him without your clothes on. You all put your clothes on.\\u201d So there\\u2019s this dynamic of men coming in and directing the woman and their dancing, nakedness, wildness and freeness.\"],[\"Dreamt about being in quarantine on multiple occasions and having to tell my partner I was diagnosed with COVID-19\"],[\"dreamt about finding a special type of facemask that I was able to wear comfortably (seriously happened)\"],[\"Dreamt I was in a very strange house.

They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates.

We\\u2019re at Stanford. Classes are in session. We\\u2019re going to a class downstairs. It seems there are a lot of football players in their red jerseys. They have red towels pulled over their heads. The professor is getting ready to teach and trying to get the guys to take the red off their head. The door is open and we slip out of the classroom. We are walking in the dark. I have to pick up something for my mom. We\\u2019re wandering along a street. We end up at an old lover\\u2019s house where he is hosting a weekly meeting. The door is painted pink. I slip in first without knocking and go to the bathroom. The toilet is light pink and purple. When I flush, there\\u2019s slime in the toilet. I wash my hands and step out. Other people are arriving and are happy to be here. I\\u2019m a bit embarrassed. We leave. We\\u2019re in a big room in another house. Shoes are for sale here. Naseem needs new shoes. She wants a pair of tall red boots. There are also a lot of light purple boots. She thinks she can take them and walk out, but there are only single boots. She needs to find a full set but can\\u2019t. She would have to get help from a cashier but she doesn\\u2019t have the money to pay. She was hoping to just get what she wanted and walk out without paying. As she is trying a pair of purple boots, another box magically opens and there is a matched pair in the box. Naseem then pulls me into the bathroom to show me someone in there. A friend I used to dance with in college is on the floor of the bathroom, lying in a really odd pose, face down, back arched, one leg kicked out to the side. Naseem is concerned about her. I say she\\u2019s just choreographing a contemporary dance. I ask her if I can join even though it\\u2019s been so long since I\\u2019ve danced. She says yes. I suggest we rehearse in the dance room rather than the bathroom. I notice that her mind is a bit off. We look through the door, but the dance room is occupied by children running about for their lesson. We go back to the bathroom floor to dance.\"],[\"Frustrating\"],[\"Full Super Moon - I dreamt that my daughter, husband, and myself were all at the doctors office, and we discovered that my daughter was pregnant and that she had had an abortion.

I start to dance with her. I swing her around. Her hands slip out from mine and she falls over the edge. I watch her fall way way way down. She almost splashes in the water, but ends up crashing down on the shore which is a bunch of wooden planks that are wet with water because the tide is going out. We have to come up with a good story to explain this. My husband says we have to leave right now and get the blood off my hands before the people come to investigate.\"],[\"Had a dream about an outbreak of the bubonic plague in London in the late 19th century. I had access to antibiotics, and had ordered many shiploads. No one would believe that I knew and understood the pathogen, or that I had the cure. I watched the cargo ships full of antibiotics stack up in the Thames in quarantine while the dying increased. I begged to be allowed to go aboard just one of the ships I'd paid for, so I could bring back antibiotics to help people, but since the ships were quarantined, I wasn't allowed. Essentially, I had it within my power to stop the ever increasing deaths, but wasn't allowed to access the supplies I'd had brought in to do it. The outbreak got worse and worse, there were dead lying in the streets to be collected and buried in pits, and I was despondent, as several new ships full of antibiotics came in each day, full of enough medicine to cure the outbreak, but just sat in quarantine.\"],[\"Had a dream about being in a romcom with Mathew McConaughey, some silly misunderstanding about a wedding, probably about The Wedding Planner movie w JLo\"],[\"Had a dream about being in car accident & Blake Shelton said \\\"don't worry Sis, I'll pull you out\\\" and did.

Often marines would climb up trying to get into my apartment and once there was a guy who knew my ex from when I was 19-21 named Will. Will was a marine I was dating when my mom died in real life. Later in the dream I was running and fighting on a moving train with the group of women. We were fighting amongst ourselves over leadership and also fighting Donald Trump who was on the other side. Then suddenly I was driving a submarine but didn\\u2019t want to take it deeper because we were in shallow water. Then Donald Trump got out at a stop and I followed him. Other women from my team joined and there was a ceremony. He kept trying to relate to me and I was cordial. We were in a stadium and as we were waiting I sunk into Warrior 1 pose deeply bending my right knee. I raised my arms and readjusted my back left leg as it was very wide out. I noticed other women doing it too. Later in the dream, I went back to fighting covert ops of both women who were double agents and attacking Trump. It was night in my dream and there was a lot of deception to watch out for.\"],[\"Had a dream that White Supremacist were Lynching many More Black people !\"],[\"Had a dream where the Cheesecake Factory was on a simplified menu due to the virus, despite being open.

This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I\\u2019m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he\\u2019s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he\\u2019s talking with me and he\\u2019s trying to court me. He\\u2019s showing me all the things he\\u2019s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he\\u2019s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he\\u2019s done, he\\u2019s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it\\u2019s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He\\u2019s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It\\u2019s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I\\u2019m in my home now - it\\u2019s not very descriptive, I just know I\\u2019m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn\\u2019t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That\\u2019s my first \\u201coh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn\\u2019t look very safe. She\\u2019s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it\\u2019s falling out. There\\u2019s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it\\u2019s also filthy. She\\u2019s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I\\u2019m offering to make them a meal - I guess they\\u2019re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she\\u2019s wild. She doesn\\u2019t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He\\u2019s just telling her what to do. He\\u2019s literally telling her: \\u201cOkay, now do this, do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s so proud of himself. He thinks he\\u2019s being the best dad. I\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god, your daughter is wrecked.\\u201d I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I\\u2019m with the next man in the lineup. It\\u2019s my ex-husband. He\\u2019s different. He\\u2019s also trying to show me how different he is. He\\u2019s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We\\u2019re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There\\u2019s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we\\u2019re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I\\u2019m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I\\u2019m really excited for their blind date. I\\u2019m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we\\u2019re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they\\u2019re snuggling up. I\\u2019m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it\\u2019s cute, it\\u2019s sweet. There\\u2019s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it\\u2019s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there\\u2019s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: \\u201cCan she do it? Is she strong enough?\\u201d Since he\\u2019s already over my back, he\\u2019s essentially in the fireman\\u2019s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why can\\u2019t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.\\u201d I realize that that\\u2019s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I\\u2019m with the next man. It\\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you\\u2019re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He\\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We\\u2019re hanging out and i\\u2019s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there\\u2019s also different types of equipment around, too. There\\u2019s these three younger men and they\\u2019re teachers or they\\u2019re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: \\u201cOh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.\\u201d So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We\\u2019ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He\\u2019s so attentive and affectionate. He\\u2019s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he\\u2019s getting agitated and I think that\\u2019s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn\\u2019t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken\\u2019s hat and I\\u2019d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He\\u2019s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5\\u20196\\u201d, I\\u2019m 5\\u201910\\u201d and Luke\\u2019s about 6\\u20192\\u201d or 3\\u201d or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It\\u2019s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: \\u201cOh my god, I didn\\u2019t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I\\u2019ve seen you strip.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat? I\\u2019ve been stripping?!\\u201d Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, \\u201cOh yeah, I totally did that, but don\\u2019t know what it was for.\\u201d Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you\\u2019re amazing and I didn\\u2019t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, \\u201cWhat, do you think you want my hat back now?\\u201d He\\u2019s saying this like he\\u2019s not going to give it to me and I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019m like whatever. I hadn\\u2019t thought of it and it\\u2019s not a big deal to me. We\\u2019re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We\\u2019re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he\\u2019s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it\\u2019s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it\\u2019s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I\\u2019m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he\\u2019s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to be a part of any of them. They all seem so unstable!\\u201d\"],[\"Honest theft, Pixie, family and bussniss\"],[\"how i be treated as Black man , getting job offers\"],[\"Husband & I Going into a dimly lit store,wearing Masks, store was combo grocery/dept store; had odd assortment of things, nothing really needed; had racks of nightgowns & night clothes.

I was watching it and there were a bunch of people, none of whom I know. It's almost like I was watching a movie. It was dark and there\\u2019s like a bunch of neon glow sticks. It was silent.\"],[\"I am a passenger in a vehicle of some kind, I think it\\u2019s a train. I\\u2019m with other people and we are looking for our home. It\\u2019s night outside. We\\u2019re going past some pick-yards filled with old smashed up cars. Then we end up at a huge mansion in this cute little town. We walk in because it is our new home. I am most impressed with the kitchen. I love it because there are three different sitting choices - a half moon table at the end of the island with a couple chairs; a longer rectangle dark wood table for 6; and a pretty shiny off-white round breakfast nook with soft pillows on the two benches. To the right of the kitchen is a big formal sitting room and dining area. The dining table is large and gleaming white. It only sits 4. The chairs have mossy soft green cushions and the place settings are lovely - silver and cream with gold, soft green napkins. There is a fireplace with antlers on the mantel. It\\u2019s very nice, elegant, cozy and inviting. Off to the side of this large room is a small library/consultation room. Later in the dream, my mom has returned from a trip into town. She has a towel wrapped around her head as if she\\u2019s just come out of the shower. She is having a counseling consultation with a woman. The house is surrounded by a lot of space. I\\u2019m walking with my friend and housemate (I don\\u2019t recognize her from waking life). She steps on a dry place with branches and fallen leaves. The ground gives way a bit and we look at each other, astonished, and I tell her: \\u201cKeep walking!\\u201d As she keeps carefully walking, the ground continues to give way and we see that it is a mote without any water in it. The mote was dug around this house many many years ago. We are astonished. We look at each other and remember: We\\u2019ve lived in this home in a past life. This house has always been in our family and it is right that we have returned. So we continue to walk, moving the ground away with our steps and remembering/revealing this mote. Now I have to go into town for an errand. I\\u2019m a passenger in a car. The town reminds me of the outer parts of San Francisco where I used to live. I\\u2019m going to meet people for ice cream. At first I just order a regular ice cream cone. But then I see that the other people have chosen a crispy cookie cone. When I look at theirs, I want it because mine is just this soggy flour burrito wrap. I ask for the crispy cookie cone and they look at the board to calculate the cost. My order comes with four layers and each cone is $3, so it will be an additional $12. I think that\\u2019s too expensive and just take the regular one. It\\u2019s not very appetizing and I don\\u2019t love it but I eat it anyway. Now I\\u2019m being driven back with a realtor and I look out to see the windmill - it has been lit up with white lights and is sparkling and beautiful against the night sky and dark ocean. The realtor points out that they had to take away all the historic sculptures from the beach because the big giant peach was cracked and needed to be renovated. So they decided to renovate all the pieces that used to be in the carnival at the beach. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh that\\u2019s sad they had to take those away.\\u201d I look out the window to the left and see that a house has been torn down. But they\\u2019re building a new house out of bottle caps. I\\u2019m amazed at this bottle cap house. On the way back to the house, we see a wonderful field and imagine going there to play and eat lunch. I know it will be a wonderful place to live.\"],[\"I am at a beach in the bright day, up on a big white plastic inflated thing\\u2026.I drop a ball down to my right, into the water at the shore\\u2026.I ask Fern, or a girl who is there, to get the ball for me\\u2026.I come down with my own ball\\u2026.Fern does not get the ball in the water, so I have to do it\\u2026.I walk into the ankle-deep water and pick it up\\u2026.A couple of men walk by on the beach, I say hello\\u2026.Then we are going to play football on the sand\\u2026.I have a ball, and I juggle it a bit, almost drop it, but make a very good catch\\u2026.A white guy in a blue shirt starts running for a pass, I throw it to him, wobbly but accurate\\u2026.He catches it and runs down the field\\u2026.I see some black women sitting down on benches by the side of the field to watch\\u2026.ok, I think, this should be fun\\u2026.I feel pretty good about how I will play\\u2026.Then, I am walking through a prosperous suburban neighborhood, into the house of a rich guy, a business leader\\u2026.the guy who is the boss of my wife's company?....I want to watch a show on his television\\u2026.It turns out he is having a work meeting soon at the house\\u2026.He bought a huge new tv for it, but it is too difficult to set up, so he will use the old television in the other room, which is what I wanted to watch in the first place\\u2026.I say to him I think that makes sense, it is hard to use new electronics right out of the box\\u2026.He seems smug and self-satisfied behind his desk\\u2026.\"],[\"I am at a big beautiful home. The couple who own the home are getting a divorce. He\\u2019s not there. She is there and she has arranged her whole wardrobe out of the closets, arranging the clothing by style and function. It\\u2019s some kind of estate sale. I\\u2019m looking at a rack of clothes with an older Chinese woman and the woman who owns the house. The owner is holding out a nice little dress suit for the Chinese woman who is kind of interested. She puts it on, but then takes off the short sleeved blouse/jacket and is really excited about the sexy strappy dress underneath. She keeps looking at the clothes and is pulling out the tight form-fitting strappy dresses. We all think it\\u2019s pretty cute that she likes this sexy style. I\\u2019m looking at beautiful sexy lingerie. I try on one and love it and another one that I also love. There\\u2019s another one that\\u2019s still in its packaging. I hold it up against my body and the lady of the house is nodding her head in approval. I decide to take all of them. Later in the dream, the man of the house is coming home. Rose and I are performing for him individually. He will choose which one of us he prefers. I do this beautiful sensual presentation that is soft and gently inviting. Then Rose does this wildly evocative and erotic demonstration that is outwardly very sexy. I\\u2019m sure he is going to choose her especially because she is so tall and gorgeous. His assistant nods at me and has me wait. He leaves and comes back a while later. He is ascending the stairs with two bunches of wild roses of pastel colors wrapped in brown paper. He gives them to me. He has chosen me.\"],[\"I am at a cafe waiting for friends to arrive. It is raining outside. We are talking about how some of our friends were just in a television series. They will be invited to a feature release party. I see a friend arrive. She wants a table where she can see the entire cafe and all the people. We order our tea then go sit at our table to wait. After we finish our tea, we leave and get in a car with a bunch of people. My parents are with us. We drive to a slaughtering lot. I see a hide of a mother cow hanging from a hook - they milked her completely dry then exploded her. There are cows, sheep, pigs and goats on conveyor belts, packed closely together and lined up for their death, but they aren\\u2019t being killed for food or any other useful purpose. They are lined up from smallest to largest. We are on a private tour and I\\u2019m watching these animals going past me on the belt. There are horses, cows, then elephants. I\\u2019m shocked at seeing a big pink pig with tusks next to an elephant - the same size as the elephant. It\\u2019s depressing to see all of this. I continue walking up a ramp. I go into an upper room and see lambs and baby unicorns. They have IV tubes wrapped around their legs - they are either being poisoned or resuscitated, I cannot tell. They do look sickly. Someone comes in and says, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019ve found the babies! I hope you are enjoying your tour!\\u201d I\\u2019m watching as these clusters of unicorns play together, but they do not look well. I walk out the door and down a ramp. I am looking out over the whole lot. It\\u2019s unusual and depressing. Then I see these huge crystal geodes that are partially submerged in the ocean - they\\u2019re purpose is to be amphitheaters for shows. We have each been assigned one to represent our energies. I see the one given to me. It is a beautiful blue and lit up with symbols on the inside. It is called The Dreamer\\u2019s Cave. We are being prepared for our amphitheaters and given massage oils to anoint our bodies. Mine is mixed with wild orange, but I am upset because it is not the right one.\"],[\"I am at a dance rehearsal. It\\u2019s the first rehearsal, so we are just learning the choreography. It\\u2019s really beautiful and dynamic with lots of interactions and refined contact improv. It is mostly men with just a few women. Then we all fall to the ground. We\\u2019re waiting for the next instructions. I\\u2019m next to my friend George - he\\u2019s gay and black. I look around through slitted eyes because we\\u2019re supposed to have our eyes closed. The choreographer instructs us that in the next few moments we are going to sit up and kiss people. This is a necessary part if we are going to remain in the cast. I\\u2019m not pleased about this. George whispers to me that now is my opportunity to get out. Somehow he slips away. The rest of us sit up and before I know what's happening an Asian man has pulled me into an embrace. His eyes don\\u2019t converge and it\\u2019s unsettling. One eye looks up and the other eye looks past me. He pulls me and I can feel him grab my lip with his teeth. I don't like it, but it\\u2019s not too awful. He continues to kiss and I try to kiss back because it\\u2019s what I\\u2019m expected to do. Then I feel his hand reach up to touch my nipple and I\\u2019m horrified by it. It feels awful. I hate it because I\\u2019m still so sensitive from nursing. So I push him away and think, \\u201cFuck this, I\\u2019m not staying for this no matter what.\\u201d I quickly walk away and am in a library. It\\u2019s dark, no lights on. I\\u2019m wandering around as if it were a maze, and I\\u2019m trying to get lost so they can\\u2019t find me. In one aisle, I hear them talking about how I just got up and left without explanation and I need to come back. I\\u2019m wearing my fitted dance clothes. I notice in my hand a big wad of paper towels. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with it because I don\\u2019t want to hold it or be found with it. I don\\u2019t have a pocket. I also don\\u2019t want to leave it on a bookshelf and there are no rubbish containers. I try to tuck it into my hair to hide it.\"],[\"I am at a Parks and Rec facility with a couple pools, workout rooms with stationary bikes and rooms upstairs for group classes. There\\u2019s a place on the farside of the pool where a man makes scones and homemade soaps and also sells produce. I get a job at the Rec Facility cleaning up. I\\u2019m at the side of the pool, pulling in the lane ropes out of the water and to the side of the pool. There are still people in the water. A man comes and is completely bald. He has a lot of vitality about him and is charming and warm. I can tell by the way he carries himself that he is a man of great wealth. He asks if he can help me and I tell him I don\\u2019t need help. I continue on with my work. He stays nearby, but is not lurking, just looking around. Then I go through the glass doors. There are bikes on display that are for sale. People have gathered to see a demonstration of a new bike. A man comes up from the crowd to help pull ropes and gears from under the ground to the stage to help demonstrate what this new bike can do. We\\u2019re all watching and waiting. This bike is expensive and the technology is quite advanced. The charming and beautiful bald man is standing next to me and after watching for a bit, he decides to buy a bike without knowing or asking the cost. I observe that he must be quite wealthy. Then, I am standing in line for my daily scone. He is with me and stands in line behind me. He is asking me about the scones, soap and produce. I tell him about how wonderful it all is. People pre-order scones, so they are guaranteed a scone each day, but there is a small selection of scones available. He steps up to the counter and orders 5 scones for both of us to share. The flavors are sophisticated, two pink ones with cardamom and peppercorn, two chocolate, and a plain one. The pink and chocolate scones are on a higher plate, and the icing drizzles down to the plain one. They look delicious. I\\u2019m looking through my credit cards, trying to find a specific one, but as I look, more cards seem to appear. I\\u2019m squinting at the cards because I can\\u2019t read them well. There are so many credit and debit cards, and I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing with them. But he pays, so I put my cards away.\"],[\"I am at my place of work and I really enjoy where I am. It has a really bright and light feeling. I can\\u2019t see exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I can\\u2019t exactly see the people around me, but I know I like them and I know that where I am feels really good. I feel like I have purpose. I feel very open and excited to do it. I have two other work engagements and I\\u2019m not as excited about either of those, but I know it\\u2019s time for me to move to my second job, so I leave this light and bright place. I go into this hardware store that\\u2019s kind of dingy and smells metallic like hardware stores do with the little mix of oil. It\\u2019s very dim lighting with fluorescent lights over the top hanging low in the ceiling but only half of them work. I can\\u2019t tell exactly what I\\u2019m doing. I think I\\u2019m organizing nuts and bolts or cleaning something out. I know I\\u2019m greasy and dirty. The woman I\\u2019m working for, the owner, is there. She\\u2019s a mother and she has these two boys that aren\\u2019t hers but they\\u2019re in her care somehow. She also has a baby with her and at one point the baby is needing care and she has a fish she\\u2019s caught. The fish needs to be filleted and cooked and somehow I\\u2019m the one who knows how to do that. So I fillet the fish and I can see the individual muscles - the layers - the way a fish fillet is layered. The baby seems to be sickly and crying and is sitting in a carrier to my right. I fillet this fish and cook it and then take one of the layers off and give it to the baby to eat. This baby seems to be 5 or 6 months old, so it seems kind of strange that I\\u2019m giving it fish, but it seems to be what it needs. There\\u2019s this overall air of sadness and grief, like this baby is going to die anyway even if I give it this nourishing fish. Then I\\u2019m back speaking with the mother and she\\u2019s asking me to keep an eye on her two boys that aren\\u2019t really hers, but she\\u2019s taking care of. I go with the boys to her house. One boy goes in the house and stays in the house and one boy stays out. They\\u2019re twins and one is not allowed inside the house, the other is. The father doesn\\u2019t let the other one in. I\\u2019m watching the two of them and as I\\u2019m watching one boy cross over this threshold and the other stay behind, this group or gang of boys from the neighborhood come. They have some sort of laundry detergent or white powder they\\u2019ve picked up from the hardware store. They throw it into the eyes of both of the boys because neither of the boys are really the children of the family - that seems to be the reason anyway. The one boy who\\u2019s allowed in the house starts to cry and he\\u2019s screaming and he\\u2019s trying to clean the powder off his face. He gets taken care of - someone in the house takes care of him, washes his eyes out. The boy that\\u2019s not allowed in the house is crying and screaming and I go to take care of him. But I\\u2019m not allowed to take care of him. Someone else is taking him. And now some time has passed and I\\u2019m standing in the bedroom - it\\u2019s an upstairs bedroom. I\\u2019m looking out the window, and to my left is the boy allowed in the house. He\\u2019s on the bed and has bandages over his eyes. As I\\u2019m looking out this second or third story window, I\\u2019m looking out at this outdoor shed or barn and it has a huge human size cage hanging from it and the other boy is in it and his eyes are bandaged. It looks like they tried to make it comfortable for him to lay down, but it is a wire cage that\\u2019s rested. He\\u2019s lying down trying to convalesce. Then all of a sudden I remember I still never went to my third job, which was working for my mother, and I really don\\u2019t want to do that. She has been calling me this whole time reminding me that I owed her - that I was supposed to show up, that I\\u2019m supposed to be there, that I\\u2019m supposed to do this work for her. I would answer the call and talk to her, then put the phone down and promptly forget that I was supposed to be there. And now it\\u2019s time for me to go and I don\\u2019t go. And the dream ends.\"],[\"I am at the house of my friend/boss. I'm trying to find a place to put a piano so I can learn to play it. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding a wall to put it against or just a spot to have it. It needs a plug and I can\\u2019t find a plug. I\\u2019m brainstorming and talking out loud with myself and with her to try and get this piano put someplace. But it\\u2019s her house, so I have this feeling of reservation because I need to get her permission. It feels a bit awkward because I don\\u2019t think she needs the piano. She\\u2019s also my boss and I\\u2019m fucking around with this piano thing, but there is work I need to be doing, so that feels a bit odd. It\\u2019s also quarantine time like now, but more apocalyptic feeling. My attention moves on from the piano and the headlines are pretty dire with deaths and whatnot. I\\u2019m also reading the astrology and getting the astrology report - it was basically telling me to buckle up because there\\u2019s more tension and destruction coming. We\\u2019ve already had a lot, but there\\u2019s more based on the planetary alignments. For whatever reason, it\\u2019s time for me to leave the house. I head out and am walking down the side of the road. I don\\u2019t know if I have my mask on or if I\\u2019m carrying it with me. The skies are dark and ominous. There are cars going by and I\\u2019m trying to avoid them. It\\u2019s strange, it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m trying to avoid people all together. The road is paved, but either side of the road are grassy fields without a lot of buildings or anything. In the distance I can see a stand of trees, way far down the way. All of a sudden there's a group of younger people also on the side of the road. I\\u2019m trying to keep distance from them for whatever reason - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s quarantine rules or what. I can hear what is going on. They\\u2019re all talking and being talked to by a scout leader or something. The scout leader is trying to prepare them for stuff. I\\u2019m trying to mind my own business and read the astrology and whatnot. They are teenagers, 16-18 years old. The scout leader is warning them: \\u201cHey, pay attention. There are people out there who will kidnap you! We\\u2019re kind of living in this no-man\\u2019s land type of place with no rules. There are definitely people out to get you.\\u201d It sounded a lot like conspiracy theory stuff, but he was basically trying to warn these kids about a cartel of people who were kidnapping kids and doing trafficking but also trying to give them coronavirus. I was nodding my head with him and saying, \\u201cYeah, watch out. This stuff is real. There are people out there who don\\u2019t have your best interest at heart and are running the world and have let this virus come out. You\\u2019ve gotta be careful because not everything is as it seems.\\u201d At this point cars are going by and I see old white people who look like they are on their way to church going by in their cars. Then, somehow the scene changes and I\\u2019m in a train station. It\\u2019s like all of a sudden I\\u2019m trying to get away from people. I see that some of these kids are on a train. It reminds me of the images I saw growing up from the Holocaust with people packed onto the trains. It\\u2019s kind of like what I\\u2019m living in the dream. There are \\u201cbad guys\\u201d who are putting us on the train and trying to scare us and poke at us. I\\u2019m watching all of this and realize it\\u2019s time for me to go. I gather up my mat that I was sitting on, my newspaper and my mask. I am watching this shady stuff go down. I start to walk away hoping no one notices me so I can walk back to my friend\\u2019s house. I do manage to sneak off and they don\\u2019t stop me.\"],[\"I am back with my Ex, and we were so happy in my dream (for so many times, I really don't want to wake up, for I do miss her so much, besides I'm a girl, too, but I don't consider myself as a typical lesbian)\"],[\"I am doing something fun with a group of people\\u2026.I have a cool note pad, with paper that seems like special stationery, with a coat of arms, ancient insignia, and a template for the week that has something cool happening on each day\\u2026.Other people are watching, though, and they have bad intentions\\u2026.They want to take all this and use it for their own purposes during the crisis\\u2026.\"],[\"I am doing things to help the Parks and Recreation characters\\u2026.Ron accidentally pokes a hole in a wall with the end of a metal pole he is using to roast meat\\u2026.\"],[\"I am going into a big, big room\\u2026.a massive cubic space, lots of people there, like a party?\\u2026.there is one word I need to remember for it all to open up, but I cannot remember it\\u2026.something about crystal?....At the end, I see Darth Vader, he just walked up on my right\\u2026.He is not scary, just curious\\u2026.\"],[\"I am having trouble sending a packet of information to the students of my class\\u2026.My message will not go through\\u2026.there are too many weird attachments, other objects and things that make it complex\\u2026.like a bad email\\u2026.I wonder, how can I do it differently?....\"],[\"I am helping a king and a queen with something\\u2026.How to get settled?....later, a group of four young people are driving in a small gray or blue sedan car\\u2026.A very modest little vehicle\\u2026.I am helping them, too\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping couples with something important\\u2026.later, I start to go into the meadow to the moon garden, but then I stop\\u2026.I realize I should go the regular way, through the trees on the trail, and not make a new trail through the grass\\u2026.Don\\u2019t take the shortcut, go the regular way\\u2026.another scene: I toss a little white packet into a waste basket\\u2026.another white packet is in there\\u2026.oh oh, wait, that is actually very useful, I should not throw it away\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping figure out an astronaut crew\\u2026.unsure how it will go\\u2026.it is secret\\u2026.Everyone goes to a star trainer\\u2026.including a woman\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping investigate something\\u2026.But it is very complex\\u2026.New evidence comes in, what do we do?\\u2026.Oh, it has a video with it\\u2026.This makes it easier\\u2026.Earlier, I see a bent log or piece of wood far down in the water\\u2026.Someone wants to get it now, but I say not now, we will get it later\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping people deal with the crisis, using an excel spreadsheet\\u2026.They do not like it, though\\u2026.I keep trying, with other ways, as they want\\u2026.But I know the spreadsheet would still be helpful\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping people with a big array of things in different kinds of glass jars, vases, and containers\\u2026.After they are empty, I help sort and clean them\\u2026.\"],[\"I am helping some bad guys or opponents with something\\u2026.a video?....They wait a long time, then it will be shown?....Each of them is holding a sack in their hands?....\"],[\"I am helping with forest products\\u2026.incense, other small organic items\\u2026.we have lots of them, laid out on metal trays\\u2026.it is cool, fun\\u2026.Later, I see a building, like a low-rent motel, saying \\u201cKingsridge\\u201d, with a vertical sign\\u2026.I think of how it is a more grand name and sign than the place itself seems to merit\\u2026.Later, I see some dark coats, jackets, and other clothing out, laying across chairs, not hung up properly\\u2026.I think of how I should do that, to help the nice clothes not get wrinkled by just sitting out like this\\u2026.\"],[\"I am hiding out with my husband at the border of Oregon and California. We are on the Oregon side in some bushes. We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We\\u2019ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we\\u2019ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn\\u2019t have to smear the lotion in the dog\\u2019s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they\\u2019re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They\\u2019ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I\\u2019m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I\\u2019m thinking that maybe he\\u2019ll drive because he isn\\u2019t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river. He has found a stick and a net on a long pole, like a pool skimmer. It\\u2019s broken around the edges and the net is slightly torn. A couple comes by with their dog on a leash. They let the dog off leash and the dog jumps in the water where my son was pretending to fish with his net. My son just stands and watches at first. But then he wants to try to fish for the dog. I tell him not to. There\\u2019s a little back and forth between us. I then tell my son that we will have to go to another part of the river or I\\u2019ll take away the net. I\\u2019d rather the people just leave with their dog instead of continuing to throw the stick into the water for the dog to fetch. Eventually I get my son to draw back and watch until they decide to leave.\"],[\"I am hosting a party. I\\u2019m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There\\u2019s a fireplace. There\\u2019s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I\\u2019m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We\\u2019re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they\\u2019re here at the party for a reason, but there\\u2019s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don\\u2019t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what\\u2019s up. They\\u2019ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There\\u2019s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what\\u2019s being discussed, but it seems like there\\u2019s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don\\u2019t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what\\u2019s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we\\u2019ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. Let\\u2019s do that. We\\u2019ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.\\u201d It must be cold outside because there\\u2019s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What\\u2019s funny is they didn\\u2019t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it\\u2019s freezing. So there\\u2019s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don\\u2019t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they\\u2019ll put them near the fire. I say, \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I\\u2019ll just go put them in the fire.\\u201d But the shoes don\\u2019t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they\\u2019re wearing are mismatched. There\\u2019s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There\\u2019s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I\\u2019m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It\\u2019s like somehow we\\u2019ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it\\u2019s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they\\u2019re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it\\u2019s just me in the end. I\\u2019m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can\\u2019t remember what the changes are now. I\\u2019m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I\\u2019m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not a good idea. You\\u2019re a woman, this isn\\u2019t a good idea for you.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they\\u2019re leaving telling him: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She\\u2019s going to do what she\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn\\u2019t have to say and stop trying to control her. I\\u2019m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn\\u2019t being heard by my dad. I couldn\\u2019t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I\\u2019m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I\\u2019m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss\\u2019 artwork but the customer\\u2019s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I\\u2019m printing it. When I see it, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this isn\\u2019t your artwork.\\u201d She comes and looks at it and is like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely not.\\u201d There are huge instructions in the order and I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cNo. We don\\u2019t print other people\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m not going to do this.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d We look over and there are packages with more of this customer\\u2019s artwork. I\\u2019m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I\\u2019m looking at my boss like, \\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.\\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I\\u2019m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they\\u2019re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, \\u201cOh, who is that?!\\u201d My friend is there, too, and I think she\\u2019s in the room with somebody, but she\\u2019s not because she\\u2019s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn\\u2019t her. We\\u2019re all like, \\u201cWho was that?!\\u201d We walk down the hall and it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don\\u2019t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHey can I get one of those? I want a turn!\\u201d Then I think he\\u2019s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he\\u2019s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I look at him like, \\u201cCan I get a turn?\\u201d and he blushes and is like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.\"],[\"I am in a big boat in the middle of a very choppy, stormy sea. I\\u2019m with a group of people. A huge wave comes and crashes over the boat, throwing us all into the water. The water is black from the storm and the night I see this animal that looks like a dead whale being pushed around on the waves. I struggle up to the whale to see if it is alive and if it could be saved. I know it is dangerous, but I do it anyway. As I reach to hold the whale, it turns into a prehistoric or alien creature, close in size to a sea turtle, but alien in shape and texture. Now I\\u2019m trying to keep a hold of this creature and bring us both to the shore. I see other people I know in the water and we are all diving under the waves to swim in calmer depths. When I come up for breath, I notice people in rowboats. They are not good people. They are wanting to capture this creature and take it from me. I need to work harder to hold on and swim deep under the water to safety. They see me one time when I go get a breath of air, and I feel like I\\u2019m in grave danger. Somehow I get away. I reach an underwater city. I open a door into an empty room and then go through another door to a cobbled street. I am still underwater, but can breathe and move easily. I must keep going and hold this creature close to me because they could get me at any moment. Then in another part of the dream, I am with my friend, George and a friend of his who I don\\u2019t know. I have a phone and an iPad. We need to get to a concert and the address and transportation information about the buses are on the devices. I\\u2019m worried that it\\u2019s time to go and we might miss the first bus. George says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make it.\\u201d Then I say I have to put on my makeup. He says, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to wear makeup girl. You\\u2019re beautiful. You\\u2019re not a baby anymore.\\u201d\"],[\"I am in a building, a gym I think. There\\u2019s a table in front of me and a tv hanging on the wall to my left. The owners of the gym or building come up to the front desk where I\\u2019m sitting. I have a photo of myself completely naked. In the photo, my upper body is facing the camera. My breasts are prominently displayed. The photo itself is sepia-toned like it\\u2019s been dyed with onion skin. I don\\u2019t want to give it to the owners but they had asked me to come up with a campaign or a slogan or a logo or something for the building. I\\u2019m very hesitant because I know that the wife is going to be derogatory and I don\\u2019t want to hear what she has to say. When I hand it to them the husband just looks at it with the male gaze taking it in and making some comment about my body which I am irritated with. And then the wife cops an eyebrow and asks why I thought that was a good idea. The scene changes and the wife and I are folding clothes together like you fold clothes at a retail store. She\\u2019s showing me these tan pouches that are closed with a zipper and are about 4x6. She tells me that these pouches can help you swim if you put them on your head. And now we are out in a harbor or beach and there\\u2019s a swimming race going on. I\\u2019m watching mostly men with these pouches on their heads swim out to a buoy and back around. She tells me that I need to swim and I don\\u2019t want to because I know that I\\u2019m out of shape and I can\\u2019t swim and my shoulder hurts. But she says that if I put the pouch on my head, I\\u2019ll be fine. It seems silly to me, but I do it anyway, but I can\\u2019t see because the pouch is over my eyes. The water is foaming. I can\\u2019t see anything as I\\u2019m swimming out to the buoy mostly trying not to drown. Then I turn around and dive under the water and suddenly everything is better. I can breathe under the water. I don\\u2019t have a stupid pouch on my head. I can see. It is crystal clear. I can see the reef, I can see the fish, I can see the sea anemones. I can see everything under the water. I can even see the swimmers up above me - their bodies swimming over my head. I\\u2019m trying to get back to the start - the shore - the beginning - but it\\u2019s through a narrow passageway and I can feel how strong the current is. I\\u2019m still underwater and I pull myself through the passageway by grabbing on the reef that is below me, pulling myself forward. Then I am out of the water and the race is over. I\\u2019m in a home with all these cut strawberries and other fruits on platters with cheese. The wife is there and she\\u2019s prepared all these platters for us to eat. The strawberries are so red and so sweet. Her demeanor has somehow changed from one of being incredibly disdainful and derogatory towards me to caring and nurturing.\"],[\"I am in a dimly lit room\\u2026.Some people come and open the door, bringing more light into the room\\u2026.They want my help with something\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a group, finishing up the holidays, trying to focus on bigger things\\u2026.but a woman wants to do a bunch of special small things for kids, as additions to all the other activities\\u2026.little toys, musical instruments, cookies\\u2026.The woman is very enthusiastic about it\\u2026.I am not, but it is ok, I am fine going along with it\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a group, we are supposed to help fill or load some train box cars\\u2026.I do not know why\\u2026.we have to move and do this fast, it feels coercive, someone making us do this\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a parking lot. I think it's where I\\u2019m supposed to be. I\\u2019ve driven there for something, I\\u2019m not sure. I\\u2019m reversed into a parking stall and I\\u2019m not sure what kind of car mine is. There\\u2019s another call a few stalls down, I think it\\u2019s a black Honda Civic. Then a few parking stalls down are a bunch of construction workers working on something. There are cut pieces of wood and sawdust everywhere. I\\u2019m not sure what they\\u2019re working on but they\\u2019re in my psychic space, making noise and part of the dream, but I\\u2019m not too focused on them, except trying to make sure I stay out of their way. I\\u2019m going through stuff in the trunk of my car. I\\u2019m rummaging through it and trying to reorganize everything. I have bags with clothes and shoes and all kinds of things in the car. So I\\u2019m trying to find something but also trying to reorganize everything. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding stuff and I realize it\\u2019s because I\\u2019m looking in the other car, my boss\\u2019 car, the black Honda Civic. I\\u2019m in the trunk of that one. There\\u2019s a pair of black high heels with bows on the front - they\\u2019re not mine, they\\u2019re hers. I\\u2019m moving them around and hen I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWait a second, no wonder I can\\u2019t find anything, I\\u2019m in the wrong car.\\u201d So I go back to my car and I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes or something. My car is broken down. I finish rummaging in the back then go up to this kiosk in the parking lot. It\\u2019s a place where you can write a claim so you can get your car fixed. There are a bunch of other people around - a family with some kids and an older lady with white hair. They\\u2019ve all already written claims and are waiting for the next step or they\\u2019re waiting in line to write their claims. It\\u2019s kind of crowded. There\\u2019s a younger woman behind the desk at the kiosk. She\\u2019s telling everybody what to do, where to go, and what to fill out. She gives me this ticket and I go to fill it out but the ticket is printed wrong. The places where you put your name and address are tilted on the ticket and not in a straight line. And the background of the ticket, instead of being blank has a watermark that is repeated along the whole ticket, so it\\u2019s hard to write anything down. I\\u2019m looking at the ticket and looking at her and am like, \\u201cIs this the thing I need to get my car fixed? Will this help?\\u201d This parking for this gigantic building, almost a skyscraper. To the left of the kiosk is this skyscraper and to my right is a hedge. It\\u2019s like this is a parking lot where you can park then go walk downtown. I\\u2019m noticing the trees. The trees are red, so it\\u2019s fall. It\\u2019s a somewhat disjointed dream because it\\u2019s an urban landscape and I don\\u2019t really know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m trying to get accomplished. I think I'm trying to get my car fixed. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m with Josh and two other people, I\\u2019m not sure who they are. We\\u2019re in this futuristic seeming town or city. The colors are white and blue, all different shades of lighter blue. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. Josh just decides he\\u2019s totally horny and grabs me by the hips and bends me over so he can fuck me from behind. But we\\u2019re on the street and on a set of stairs going up to a building. The buildings are low, not skyscrapers. There are no plants anywhere, but if there are, they are shades of white and blue. There\\u2019s just this entrance to a building where we stop at. I think that maybe we\\u2019re traveling with this other couple but I\\u2019m not sure where and I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re doing.\"],[\"I am in a room, trying to organize things for people who need help\\u2026.Below I see a black and white cow, energetic, active, and happy, trotting over, about to come up the stairs\\u2026.I quickly get out of the way to let it do so and come up, trying not to distract or deter it because of my presence\\u2026.Something about earlier dealings with dad\\u2026.At another point, I am in a car in a big town, lots of people on the streets, other cars stopped, waiting\\u2026.I suddenly see a bad guy I know, with wild gray hair, Ferdie?, running down the street in the gutter between the sidewalk and the street, with a big machine gun, he just robbed a place\\u2026.now he is trying to get away\\u2026.I see him get into a car with lots of women in fancy dresses, to hide or make them drive him, to escape?....\"],[\"I am in a school, parts of it look like my old high school and the people I\\u2019m with feel like my old classmates. I\\u2019m teaching and it feels like what I\\u2019m teaching is very basic - it\\u2019s stuff that most people already know, although my classmates don\\u2019t seem to know it. I leave the classroom that I\\u2019m in and head outside. There\\u2019s a bunch of kids - they\\u2019re younger than me and they\\u2019re not particularly friendly. It\\u2019s definitely a clique and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re showing off and I don\\u2019t really feel welcome, so I leave and head to this classroom where another young woman is teaching and I love what she\\u2019s teaching. It\\u2019s all new and I\\u2019ve never run into it before, but it makes perfect sense and it\\u2019s a type of sociology about the way humans interact and how we communicate and can have adult mature conversations. The kids in this clique are in there, kind of, but they\\u2019re acting like they\\u2019ve heard all of it even though it\\u2019s all new to me. I\\u2019m just noticing the difference between my classmates who I was teaching who are older and these younger kids who seem to already know a lot and are very aloof. I sit down and have a conversation with the teacher who is maybe a little bit younger than me but not by much. She tells me about this raincoat or jacket (I forget the name she called it), but she\\u2019s showing me this things she\\u2019s wearing and it looks like a snakeskin where she cut a slit through the side of the body and can fit her head into when she puts it on it actually expands out and her arms go - one side goes down into the tail and the other side goes down into the head and expands and lifts up and out. It covers her like a cape, but when she takes it off it goes back into its snakeskin size and she just curls it up and puts it in her bag. I\\u2019m totally fascinated and she very much loves it and likes talking about it. She says it\\u2019s a lot like the capes that the Scots used to wear. I don\\u2019t know what that means. I take her word for it. And then it\\u2019s time for us to leave this classroom. We\\u2019re going to a competition of sorts. She and these standoffish kids and me and some of my friends who are going to be performing, we get in the back of a truck/wagon and we\\u2019re on our way. The standoffish kids are down at the bottom and even though it\\u2019s a celebration, they are not drinking any alcohol. The friends around me, they have all of their instruments and supplies, and they keep talking about the alcohol they\\u2019re going to drink, and I don\\u2019t want to. I think, no, we don\\u2019t want to drink, it makes us poor players, it makes us so we can\\u2019t compete very well. We won\\u2019t win. One of them starts to pass around a bottle of champagne and I say I don\\u2019t want it. I stick a cork in it, but the cork won\\u2019t stay - the fizzies keep popping it off. Somebody else comes in and says, \\u201coh there\\u2019s a way to make a cork that will stay but you have to know the magic.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t seem to know it. I don\\u2019t like it anyway. I just keep thinking that if they start drinking, we won\\u2019t be able to compete and those other kids will win the competition. It seems so off to me that alcohol is still available anyway. We arrive at the carnival/festival/competition place we were heading to. There\\u2019s a big outdoor tent. It\\u2019s kind of dark and gloomy throughout this whole dream - not a lot of sunshine. The younger kids go off and set up their project or their music or whatever it is. Me and my companions also set up our space. What I notice is there\\u2019s not a lot of help getting it set up. I can tell I\\u2019m doing a lot of work. We have some sort of booth and people are coming by. We are explaining to the judges what our booth represents - what all the things we\\u2019ve set up are for. There\\u2019s this feeling that is not quite up to snuff or up to par - it\\u2019s not what\\u2019s needed right now. Whatever it is that we\\u2019re showing or doing is 2 or 3 steps behind whatever those kids are setting up or doing - just like in the school where they seemed 2 or 3 steps ahead in their courses already even though I was a teacher that was teaching to my peers. The fair thing is over now and it\\u2019s time to clean up and clear off the table. All of my friends leave and leave me to do the cleaning up for myself. I\\u2019m distraught because I\\u2019m supposed to go with those younger kids wherever they\\u2019re going. That teacher is with them and she\\u2019s beckoning me to come with, but I don\\u2019t go because if I don\\u2019t clean up, nobody else will and I\\u2019m the only one who knows where everything goes anyway.\"],[\"I am in a swimming pool, with lots of people\\u2026.there will be a race?....I realize that things will take a while to organize, and meanwhile I have time to go inside and smoke some plums\\u2026.I go in, and realize I am naked\\u2026.hmm, that is strange, are other people naked too?....I wonder if my swimsuit is nearby\\u2026.it does not seem like a big deal, I will get back in the water and it will be fine\\u2026.Later, I see some homeless guys on a street corner, playing rhythms with Quaker Oats big cylinder containers as drums\\u2026.I have an oats container of my own, with a handful of oats inside shaking around, and I go over and play with them, dancing and skipping around happily to the beat\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in a truck, the driver parks it in a weird place next to a creek\\u2026.The driver gets out and leaves, while I am still in the truck\\u2026.Then the truck slips, and somehow ends up on a little island in the creek\\u2026.I wonder, how did that happen?....Other park rangers on the other side of the creek, look at me with mild concern, but do nothing\\u2026.OK, what do I do?....I wonder, should I jump over the water?....I could do so, it is not that far a jump\\u2026.Later, I go back to the truck, and a small old blue car is parked by the sidewalk\\u2026.It is revving its engine hard and loud, which makes me want to keep my distance\\u2026.I see a guy behind the wheel, his girlfriend next to him, and maybe a kid?....Hispanics?....I am scared of them, and try not to get their attention\\u2026.I walk by the car and casually pick up a paper clip from the ground, a couple of bent ones are scattered around\\u2026.They drive away, and I am relieved, phew\\u2026.Earlier, Hillary Clinton is part of some small group of people\\u2026.The others like her, she is a good worker, gets stuff done\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in charge of creating more clues for the big scavenger hunt\\u2026.We are supposed to make the clues easier, more interconnected, keep the group together\\u2026.Some people worry that it is not happening\\u2026.I do it, but then I forget where the clues are\\u2026.Now I get worried, do I have to manage this whole thing?....No, at some point I realize this is not real, I am relieved\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in charge of some animals, helping them get through this crisis\\u2026.There are several different kinds of cats\\u2026.I am trying to make sure they all get along in a friendly way\\u2026.Earlier, something about a big oval rock or boulder\\u2026.the image of it, surrounded by lots of smaller rocks, like they are all floating in space\\u2026.The big rock is my connection, my way to get home amid all the other rock formations\\u2026.\"],[\"I am in Elizabeth\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s the house I\\u2019ve always known since I was young. We\\u2019ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I\\u2019ve brought isn\\u2019t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, \\u201cSee how tall the ceiling is?! It\\u2019s always been this tall.\\u201d Then I say, \\u201cYes, so tall!\\u201d Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can\\u2019t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn\\u2019t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she\\u2019ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, \\u201cOh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I\\u2019ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.\\u201d She\\u2019s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I\\u2019m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day. When I go to her office this time, it\\u2019s different. There are walls around the office. She\\u2019s there, but the bears are not.\"],[\"I am in the Kensington house, trying to get ready for a run\\u2026.but I do not have the right gear?....then to my surprise I see a big black bear outside\\u2026.I am amazed, but scared\\u2026.What does it want?....I need to make sure it stays outside, does not come in the house\\u2026.It crawls over the deck, and seems to go up the north side of the house\\u2026.Then I see in the back deck Strauss our cat, sitting near a couple of bear cubs\\u2026.I can tell Strauss is uncomfortable, so I quickly let him in\\u2026.Later, I am telling about all this to a woman I like a lot\\u2026.Earlier, I find myself standing next to a big elk, and its light-colored rear haunches\\u2026.I pat it gently on the back, right at the base of its spine, and rest my hand there\\u2026.I think that feels good for the elk\\u2026.\"],[\"I am involved in a process with two aspects\\u2026.One is not popular with the public\\u2026.something to do with the Nazis?....How to integrate the two is the question, the challenge\\u2026.\"],[\"I am involved in lots of friendly activities with other people\\u2026.but I suddenly wonder with some anxiety, is this too much social interaction, too close together, not being careful enough, will this cause problems?....At some point I open the door to my study, and Phantom our cat rushes out, causing me concern, but then to my surprise he immediately turns around and comes back inside again\\u2026.\"],[\"I am lost in a hospital trying to find my way back to my own unit but keep finding my self in a construction area. I'm frantic but not afraid.\"],[\"I am on a break from class. This is midway into the dream and I cannot recall the parts just before. I\\u2019m walking through a parking lot by an ocean. I\\u2019m picking up speed and running then flying over the ocean. I\\u2019m catching the wind and feeling free, but also realize the break is almost over and I need to get back to class quickly. I am skimming over the ocean, feeling the splash of the salt water. At first I\\u2019m going out to sea, then I catch the wind under my arms. A big wave is coming and I catch it. I\\u2019m surfing flying the wave like a pelican. I can feel the momentum and it\\u2019s exhilarating. It takes me right next to a rock face and between a narrow crevice of rocks. I can see the water rise as the wave and I approach. It\\u2019s as if time slows so I can precisely fly through this narrow area without catching the sides of the rocks. I make it to shore and return to the classroom. The desks have been rearranged. They are set up closer together. I recall having a conversation with a woman before break about where to sit. She\\u2019s a young Asian woman and reminds me of a Biology Major and Pre-Med student at Stanford University. We will be sitting next to each other at the back of the classroom. I arrive before she does and see her notebooks stacked on a chair. I move them over one so that my chair is closest to the professor\\u2019s desk. Other people are coming in now and finding their desks. The young Asian woman comes to sit next to me in the back. I get up and push the desks around so they aren\\u2019t so cramped together. She has just voted for the president. She is talking with me about how Edward has been communicating with her about upcoming projects and he\\u2019s looking to hire someone new at the end of October. I\\u2019m concerned that my work will be done and a new intern will come in. I\\u2019m uneasy about this. Then more students come in. The woman is yelling at the students and taunting them about not voting. She is very righteous in proclaiming that she already voted and used her break time wisely. She is telling them that they must vote now. The professor is now sitting at his desk. It\\u2019s Edward. The desk is in the far left back corner of the room facing the students. We are all in our chairs that have the desks attached to them facing the front of the room. There are blank chalkboards across the front. Edward raises his voice and sternly says, \\u201cWe are not to take sides! In no way are we to take sides!\\u201d This quiets the woman and all the other students now. He\\u2019s clearly irritated and reviewing his lesson plan. He\\u2019s looking over a list of historic figures and saying the names aloud so we remember the ones he has talked about already. I\\u2019m hearing the names of these men, but it\\u2019s as though I\\u2019m hearing them for the first time. These are names of politicians that I feel like I should know but I do not. I\\u2019m trying to write them all down as quickly as I can so I can look them up later and be better informed.\"],[\"I am on a mission to gather all systems and screens that filter reality for people\\u2026.I set them aside, so I only get direct reality\\u2026.Others do not know or understand this, but I do not care\\u2026.A situation comes up, there is no filter, and I deal with it fine, all is good\\u2026.At another point, I see coming up on the beach a big white shark\\u2026.I realize it knows it can still attack people this way\\u2026.It comes up on the sand, and chases people\\u2026.I go inside, get people in, then close the door\\u2026.The shark pushes hard against the door, forcing it open a few inches\\u2026.Scared, I struggle to keep it from breaking inside all the way\\u2026.\"],[\"I am on a train - like a child\\u2019s park train - with a bunch of other people. We are heading back from grocery shopping. Each person is dropped off at their house and the train continues down the tracks. I arrive at my house - a shared co-op style home. I\\u2019m putting away the groceries. There are other people in the kitchen with me. Then I\\u2019m in a more public space. I have to go the bathroom and am uncomfortable because I no longer like to use public restrooms because of the fear of other people\\u2019s lack of health or cleanliness. I go into the bathroom and see that the toilet lid and seat are covered in purple bubble wrap. I need to pull it off and put on new purple bubble wrap. I do this but am frustrated because the person before me didn\\u2019t do her job in cleaning up after herself. I lift the lid up and see that someone has defecated but not bothered to flush. Now I have a handful of purple bubble wrap, but still need to flush the toilet, then use the toilet, and somehow not contaminate myself. It\\u2019s frustrating and I don\\u2019t think I ever do use the bathroom. I\\u2019m looking for a trashcan to throw all this stuff out, then wash my hands and leave. Then I go out to the lawn. There\\u2019s a group of people singing songs. I join them. One of the songs is so wonderful that it makes me leap up and dance. I\\u2019m the only one dancing in the green grass and under the bright blue sunny sky. I\\u2019m feeling so happy alive, to be outside, to be dancing, and to be feeling free. Even though others are still not dancing, I do not hold myself back from this joy. Then later on, I\\u2019m inside a big building. There are a lot of people beginning to gather for a dance. The large group is subdivided into several smaller groups. There are rules for this dance. You have to wait to be chosen. My smaller group has two different leaders - a black man and a white woman. They are one-by-one choosing people to enter the dance. The other smaller groups are doing the same. So with each person, the dance floor gets more crowded. Finally, it\\u2019s just me and another standing and waiting in this crowd of dancers. I\\u2019m really wanting this guy to come choose me because I love the way he dances and I\\u2019m so excited for the possibility of dancing with him and feeling his rhythm. Then someone turns around and looks at me and says, \\u201cWell, you can start dancing now. You don\\u2019t have to wait for anybody.\\u201d I wonder if it\\u2019s okay for me to be dancing by myself. I look around and see everyone dancing by themselves.

I keep going into a building but I\\u2019m not supposed to be inside because it\\u2019s reserved for other people. A convention or something is happening. I see my hula halau there - my kumu hula and all my hula sisters. They\\u2019re going to do a show. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome dance with us.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there and am like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember any of the dances.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don\\u2019t remember the dances. They also don\\u2019t remember. It\\u2019s like we haven\\u2019t practiced in a long time and we haven\\u2019t gotten together in a long time. But we\\u2019re all getting together for this. I feel so awkward. It\\u2019s really just affording me a reason for me to be in this building that I need or just want to be in. I\\u2019m not sure why. The halau is getting ready. I think I\\u2019m still in costume. I hide from them. I climb up a balcony or something. I\\u2019m not even taking stairs. I\\u2019m climbing things and definitely trespassing. I get to a classroom and it\\u2019s a kindergarten classroom. All the kindergarten decor is in there. I\\u2019m hiding in there. I think the teacher is trying to get the classroom ready because there aren\\u2019t a lot of kids. But there are some kids, so I think maybe it\\u2019s a school. I need to use the bathroom and it\\u2019s a little kid\\u2019s bathroom so the toilet is just two feet off the ground. I come out and have these feelings that I shouldn\\u2019t be here but don\\u2019t know why I need to be there. I head out of the classroom and climb back down and head back to the hula sisters. We do perform but I don\\u2019t know if I actually perform with them or watch. I wake up with this sense of not knowing what\\u2019s going on, I shouldn\\u2019t be here, I don\\u2019t have the skills, I don\\u2019t remember the dances, and none of this is my scene.\"],[\"I am performing on a stage. There are two other people with me and a big audience watching us along with a judge. The three of us are doing an interpretation of a dance that has been taught to us. There\\u2019s something to do with jumping over a plastic spice lid and when you jump you need to land with the right amount of strength so just the right amount of ginger pops up out of the lid to dust the floor just enough. I am dancing with a lot of energy and flare. It feels so good. At the end, the judge leaps onto the stage and lifts my hand up and bows with me saying that i have done it just perfectly. The crowd is cheering. There are also people who have noted my perfection of sorts and I don\\u2019t feel particularly safe by their attention. There is another scene where I am in a department store. On one level are clothes designed to fit me and there is a prenatal section. On the floor above are clothes designed for heavier set women and they also have a prenatal section. I\\u2019m on the upper floor, then descend to the floor with clothes that fit me. I go to the prenatal section because I remember seeing pants that I really like. I see Liz and some other women in that female entrepreneur coaching world. They are sitting on a couch watching a show or learning something. Liz sees me and stands but doesn\\u2019t acknowledge me in a friendly way. She just stands so that I know that she knows I\\u2019m there. There\\u2019s a section with folded pants - the style I like. I know what used to fit me when I was pregnant and I recall how they were stretchy. Other people are coming to get these pants, too - I guess they just learned about them on the show. Liz picks up a pair, too. They are all hand painted and very colorful. I then decide to take some plain balls out of the box, so we have all the balls we could ever want to play with.\"],[\"I am playing dominos with someone\\u2026.We both draw, the other person plays first, a double five\\u2026.perhaps the best opening play of all\\u2026.I look at my tiles, they are almost all blanks\\u2026.the lowest possible hand\\u2026.\"],[\"I am putting nuts and garbanzo beans up in a tree, to help feed the animals there\\u2026.Later, I see my sister's husband, he is much thinner\\u2026.He has been running a lot\\u2026.I am unsure if he looks healthier or not\\u2026.He seems gaunt\\u2026.\"],[\"I am running down a rocky dirt trail, carrying a handsaw in my right hand\\u2026.I go very fast, it is fun\\u2026.I know there are some girls, young women in the area, I wonder if they will see me as I cruise down the trail, they will be impressed\\u2026.I go so fast, my white Nike Free shoes almost come off my feet, I have to slow down\\u2026.Earlier, I am in a city area and I see four young people walking across the street\\u2026.Three of them are visiting the fourth, who works near me, and I am surprised and disappointed when he says to his friends there is nothing really of interest around here, no good restaurants\\u2026.I suppose that is true, but I still do not like him criticizing an area we share\\u2026.As they walk away from the main street, past a construction site, I wonder if the four of them are on a double date\\u2026.The other guy has blue hair, and one of the women has bluish hair, too, will they be a couple?....I see they are going towards a Mexican restaurant in a nondescript building, but with lots of people there, it must be good\\u2026.\"],[\"I am scared I will die from it.\"],[\"I am talking to a detective who I\\u2019m hiring to go watch my ex-father-in-law and my dad who are supposed to be taking turns watching my son who is an infant. They\\u2019re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don\\u2019t work. The reason I\\u2019m hiring this detective is because I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re watching my son very well and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s entirely safe. They\\u2019re watching him for me because I\\u2019m working and I don\\u2019t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They\\u2019re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It\\u2019s odd that they\\u2019re together because they don\\u2019t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they\\u2019re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who\\u2019s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they\\u2019re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I\\u2019m observing this whole thing. I\\u2019m on the pool deck somewhere but they don\\u2019t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They\\u2019re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you\\u2019re both talking shit about me and the fact that I\\u2019m not around to watch my son and it\\u2019s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I\\u2019m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can\\u2019t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law\\u2019s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn\\u2019t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.\\u201d My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There\\u2019s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I\\u2019m having them watch my son in the first place. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson\\u2019s mom to him. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I\\u2019m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, \\u201cPick a spot.\\u201d All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that\\u2019s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don\\u2019t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it\\u2019s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they\\u2019re taking the exam. I don\\u2019t have my books. In fact I didn\\u2019t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I\\u2019m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don\\u2019t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I\\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don\\u2019t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn\\u2019t miss too much and I could just get someone else\\u2019s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.\"],[\"I am teaching a yoga class. I\\u2019m subbing for my friend. It\\u2019s like I just pop up out of bed and there I am in the yoga studio. So I\\u2019m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it\\u2019s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don\\u2019t know who they are or where we are or what I\\u2019m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it\\u2019s just so odd. So I\\u2019m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren\\u2019t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I\\u2019m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can\\u2019t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it\\u2019s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn\\u2019t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It\\u2019s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I\\u2019m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can\\u2019t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I\\u2019ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.\"],[\"I am touring a large apartment building. Units are being made available as people move. Some are moving out completely, others are moving for a better view. When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I\\u2019m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we\\u2019ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That\\u2019s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I\\u2019d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There\\u2019s a sign about reservations required. It\\u2019s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It\\u2019s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I\\u2019m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don\\u2019t want to pay because there\\u2019s only fifteen minutes left. I\\u2019m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn\\u2019t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we\\u2019re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It\\u2019s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I\\u2019m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there\\u2019s no place for me to sit. I\\u2019m watching my son to see if he\\u2019s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.\"],[\"I am trying to explain to a group of people how a play has multiple levels\\u2026.One or two levels lower than the surface\\u2026.We set up an example with a guy student, to make it easy to understand\\u2026.One of the lower levels is the unconscious, I try to explain that\\u2026.\"],[\"I am walking down the hall of a big house or mansion\\u2026.I have a box with a live mouse in it\\u2026.I am going to give it to one of our cats, to eat\\u2026.I come to a sitting room where a couple of people are already playing with the cat\\u2026.it\\u2019s Levi?....So I wait, not wanting to disrupt their play\\u2026.I feel some misgivings about letting the cat have the mouse, but not too much\\u2026.Earlier, a woman sits on my lap, we make out\\u2026.\"],[\"I am walking on a sidewalk with my husband and see a pile of packages ready to be mailed. They\\u2019re addressed to our parents and from our friend Sherry. I think it\\u2019s such a nice gesture that she bought presents for our parents and we didn\\u2019t even think to. We see that one package is not fully wrapped. It\\u2019s a cake and waffles. We nibble the waffles and love them! We eat around the perimeter and hope it doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019ve been snacking on their gift. Then I\\u2019m with my husband and his family - dad, step-mom and step-sisters. We\\u2019re standing in a circle and they are passing around the beautiful cake that Sherry sent. They cut different sized slices and Krista takes an extra large slice - it\\u2019s so big there isn\\u2019t enough for everyone. Either I or my son grab the cake from her and start to eat. She\\u2019s upset, but the rest of the group says \\u201cno, they need cake, too.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful cake with orange frosting, different layers and textures. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in the same room, but it\\u2019s later in the day. I\\u2019m alone with my son. My husband\\u2019s dad walks in but he looks like a zombie, as if he\\u2019s been in a car accident. He\\u2019s completely bald and white pale and his face is streaming with blood. Then a younger version of my husband\\u2019s dad comes in with blood streaming down his face, too.\"],[\"I am walking out of a building, and I pass a woman with a big brown dog\\u2026.The dog is nice to me, I pet it\\u2026.After I pass and reach the gate, I realize I have potato chips in my other hand\\u2026.The dog smells them, is interested\\u2026.It turns back to me, and I wonder what I should do now\\u2026.I hold my hand with the chips up high, and compliment the woman on her dog, and slowly walk away\\u2026.Later, I am sitting in a large space, like an airport terminal, putting away a collection of little toys I had arranged in front of me\\u2026.A family walks by, and the little girl sees the toys and wants to play with them\\u2026.She is intrigued by the tiny action figures, animals, a white angel with big wings\\u2026.it is fine with me, but I wonder if the parents mind\\u2026.this is slowing them down\\u2026.but they are ok with it\\u2026.The mom wanders away, and the dad, a black guy, goes up into some scaffolding next to us\\u2026.To make conversation, I ask where they are from\\u2026.He says in London for the last 8 years, but all over before that\\u2026.At another point, before perhaps, I am walking quickly down a curving path, dark green trees on either side\\u2026.Suddenly it is so foggy I cannot see anything\\u2026.I keep going, I cannot slow my momentum, but I am terrified I will crash head-on into a car driving up on the other side\\u2026.I try to maintain my rightward curve with the path, even though I can see nothing through the thick gray mist\\u2026.Then, just as suddenly, I get to the bottom of the path, and I am fine, and relieved\\u2026.I look back, and the fog is gone\\u2026.It\\u2019s just a normal, small path\\u2026.At the end, I am at a parking lot, coming out of a big parking structure\\u2026.I watch people with tiny vehicles and mechanical animals try to wind around cement curbs and bumps to get into the garage\\u2026.It seems very tedious and inefficient\\u2026.I walk away from the building, and pass two black women who seem to work there as attendants\\u2026.They talk about the airport, how they changed the rules about pilot training\\u2026.Pilots now need to know how to manage wind shear effects over large forested areas\\u2026.I hear another woman ask what that is, and a worker guy gives a surprisingly smart explanation\\u2026.He tells of seeing a tall tree that had been poorly cut whip fast in several directions during a storm, very dangerously\\u2026.\"],[\"I am walking through a large oval or rectangular playground or park, surrounded by tall chain link metal fences\\u2026.I am crossing the playground, from one entry to another, when I see my cousin Dale\\u2026.He is on a skateboard, with his shirt off, riding around\\u2026.I notice his skin is darker than I expect, deep tan or bronze, and I am surprised and impressed at how thickly muscled his chest is\\u2026.much more muscled than me\\u2026.As I walk out of the playground, I wonder, is he really in that much better shape than I am?....is it because I am older than he is?....But I think we are about the same ages\\u2026.Later, I feel ants crawling on my back, near the top on either side of my spine\\u2026.I try to brush them off\\u2026.\"],[\"I am walking through the woods with a group of people. Tad is there in this group, too. He lingers towards the back and I slow down to linger with him. We walk closer together and brush shoulders and hands as we talk. He pulls me over and begins kissing me. It\\u2019s intoxicating. We make love in a clearing. Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There\\u2019s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I\\u2019m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there\\u2019s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I\\u2019ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I\\u2019ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend. My friend is at a bar and I tell them what\\u2019s going on. I laugh. Then I\\u2019m suddenly at the bar, outside. I can see stuffed animal penguins in the grass - one on its side and one on its feet, walking towards the water. There\\u2019s another moment with Tad - beautiful and romantic coming together that I wish I could remember better.\"],[\"I am watching a mom I know from town. Her daughter is about the same age as my son. In waking life, she has always been discontent with being a mother.

She has made a deal for her birthday that the time with her daughter will be front loaded to this time of life, so she can get it over with. Somehow, her daughter will grow older faster, while the mom ages at the same rate. So time is expanded in some way. It\\u2019s unusual to watch. Now I\\u2019m in an airplane and my brother in law is flying it. I\\u2019m grateful for his skill - he flies helicopters in waking life. He\\u2019s taking off and we\\u2019re gaining momentum, though not climbing high into the air as quickly as I expected. He\\u2019s staying low to the ground and identifying men who he knows as officers in the military. He flies directly over their head - the sergeant, the colonel and the captain. We are escaping.

I\\u2019m watching each of the steps she\\u2019s taking. I go to put my hands near the cart with artifacts. Everything feels really strong. I can feel the energy coming off. She keeps asking things like, \\u201cCan you feel that? We\\u2019re adding extra protection.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOf course I can feel that. Everything is really strong. This is what I\\u2019m trained for.\\u201d At one point she interrupts herself and apologizes. She says, \\u201cThese are my neuroses and I worry about these things. This is what I worry about, but I think you\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, I will be fine. I\\u2019ve had the training. I\\u2019m strong. I can feel the energy coming off. I can direct and mold and shape it as you\\u2019re doing. This is something I know how to do.\\u201d Then I maybe leave her to go run an errand or something. The scene changes and I\\u2019m outside the house. I\\u2019m walking through the town on the streets. I know a car accident is going to happen and then I witness it but keep going because I know the people can handle whatever is happening because it\\u2019s not a bad one, it\\u2019s just a fender bender t-bone, but everyone was going less than 25mph. Everyone is okay, they just have to get everyone\\u2019s insurance information. I continue to this open air marketplace. There are all kinds of items that you would find at a fair trade shop. I think I\\u2019m getting an ingredient we need for the cart and the spells we\\u2019re casting. I\\u2019m vibrating and radiating so much power, and I\\u2019m watching who\\u2019s starting to follow me. While I think everyone in this marketplace is human, some of the people are wearing helmets with horns, and someone looks like a totem - the totem is gold and I can\\u2019t tell whether it\\u2019s a hat they\\u2019re wearing or if they just are the totem with the different animals stacked on top of each other. So I\\u2019m just noticing who\\u2019s following me, who\\u2019s attracted to my energy and who\\u2019s not. Some of the people following me do have what feels like somewhat ill-intent but I know I\\u2019m untouchable so I\\u2019m not so worried about it. Some of the people following me don\\u2019t even know why they\\u2019re attracted to my energy, they just are, and they\\u2019re harmless. I\\u2019m going on my way even though I see all the people who are attracted to me or who are tracking me. Some of them are magic-makers themselves and they can do magic but they\\u2019re just watching. I find the item I\\u2019m supposed to find. I\\u2019m still watching who\\u2019s coming in and out of this market, noting who the non-magical beings are. I walk by this booth where they\\u2019re closing up shop because it\\u2019s twilight and the open air market is closed. One of the people closing up shop is Janaya Future Kahn and they are someone I know from instagram who identifies as \\u201cthey.\\u2019 They are beautiful and on instagram they do social justice work. The way they talk is so amazing, always coming from love. Even in my dream as I\\u2019m walking past them in their booth and they\\u2019re folding things up for the evening, they\\u2019re talking about love and getting things to people in need. I slow down long enough to watch them fold up one of their items and to listen to them talk. I\\u2019m so smitten because this person is such a caring, warm, loving person but also very fiery and passionate about what they\\u2019re doing. I know I\\u2019m to return back to my post, which is this house on the edge of the lake. As I\\u2019m walking back I see piers with sailboats and this house juts out over the water. It\\u2019s important that we\\u2019re over the water and that the water is under us in parts of our work. I\\u2019m watching the sun go down and it\\u2019s almost dark but the sky is all these beautiful colors. I know that I have all the skills I need for the task at hand. In fact, I\\u2019m overflowing with the amount of energy. I do think it\\u2019s interesting that when I walked by Janaya Future Kahn, they didn\\u2019t look up and see me; they were so focused on what they were doing that out of all the people in the marketplace who could feel me, they didn\\u2019t look up and see me at all. I thought it was so interesting that they were so engrossed in what they were doing and the conversation they were having with other people that they never even looked up.\"],[\"I am with a friend but I\\u2019m not actually sure who it is - there\\u2019s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we\\u2019ve known each other for a while. We\\u2019re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don\\u2019t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We\\u2019re walking through a town. We\\u2019re on the streets of the downtown area. It\\u2019s dark - like night time or really early morning. We\\u2019re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that\\u2019s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she\\u2019s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it\\u2019s a room off to the side. I\\u2019m so happy to see her. She\\u2019s such a beautiful soul. And she\\u2019s so happy to see me. She\\u2019s showing me some of the pieces she\\u2019s working on. It\\u2019s an interesting interaction because there\\u2019s this air of how much we love each other and she\\u2019s so excited about all her work and I\\u2019m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They\\u2019re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there\\u2019s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it\\u2019s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she\\u2019s found a different coffee shop. So we\\u2019re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It\\u2019s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I\\u2019m happy to see her, but also not. There\\u2019s a little bit of, \\u201cOh no, I don\\u2019t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me\\u201d (which is what happened in real life). So I\\u2019m kind of glad to see her, but there\\u2019s also part of her that\\u2019s also sort of ignoring me. She\\u2019s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I\\u2019m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I\\u2019m with - the one who I still don\\u2019t know who it is - says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.\\u201d So, we\\u2019re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There\\u2019s a bunch of people at it. They\\u2019ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\\u2019m on vacation. I\\u2019m not doing any business. There\\u2019s no meetings.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWell you know this is a BNI meeting.\\u201d The way these things work is if you\\u2019re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn\\u2019t know that was happening, but it feels like that\\u2019s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that\\u2019s gotten us in the mess we\\u2019re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh D\\u2019s here! Great!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my fucking god, get me out of here now.\\u201d He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn\\u2019t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, \\u201cEh.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cEw.\\u201d He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cFuck, you can\\u2019t even be neutral. You can\\u2019t even control your body. You\\u2019re in my damn space and I don\\u2019t even want to be here!\\u201d I still haven\\u2019t had any food or coffee, so probably I\\u2019m \\u201changry\\u201d - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don\\u2019t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I\\u2019m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it\\u2019s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it\\u2019s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I\\u2019m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There\\u2019s a pier off to my right. There\\u2019s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He\\u2019s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He\\u2019s also writing stuff out in the sand that they\\u2019re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren\\u2019t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I\\u2019m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There\\u2019s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I\\u2019m noticing them as I\\u2019m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I\\u2019m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.\"],[\"I am with a group of people\\u2026.We are each given a surprisingly simple object, and with that we are supposed to do complicated things\\u2026.This is not normal, we are all used to more elaborate objects to do this, so everyone is confused\\u2026.I am somewhat in charge of the process\\u2026.It is uncoordinated, but eventually we do what needs doing\\u2026.Lots of white cubes, spears, globes\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with a group of sisters and we\\u2019re all standing on yoga mats but we\\u2019re not doing yoga. I have taken off my adornments and placed them at the top of the mat and they\\u2019re almost in Ursula's in space, so she gives me this look and so I in a really apologetic way move them over to the side and hide away in a bit of shame for that. Again I\\u2019m not able to stand in my true power and be myself in her presence. There's a direction from somewhere, someone telling us to remove our clothes. We are all wearing these beautiful silk flowing gowns. Nobody moves at first. It\\u2019s an odd direction and we don\\u2019t know where it\\u2019s coming from. Then Ursula who is across from me on a mat steps forward in this really seductive way starts to slip off her dress. Two women on either side who are studying with her are her attendants and they help her remove her gown and all of her underthings. Then everyone else proceeds to do so. I feel like, oh gosh I have to also and so I remove my outer gown, but I keep on my underwear because I haven\\u2019t waxed and I\\u2019m feeling pretty shameful about that. So I\\u2019m left wearing a black thong. Then I\\u2019m in a room and one of my husband\\u2019s friends is lying on a couch. He\\u2019s 7 feet tall - a really big guy - and he\\u2019s kind of joking around. He says something that agitates me. I climb up onto him and start to pound on him in a playful way. And I say, \\u201cYou know I never really do this with anybody else, but you\\u2019re so big and it just seems okay to do this.\\u201d He\\u2019s laughing and he thinks it\\u2019s a funny thing, too. Then I\\u2019m in a building and I\\u2019m talking to this very wealthy man - a billionaire, creative person who I don\\u2019t know in waking life. My husband\\u2019s friend in the previous scene is also a very wealthy man. He\\u2019s talking about his vision for what he wants to create and bring me along with it. We are in a glass skyscraper type building and we see King Kong. King Kong is smashing buildings and it seems like he\\u2019s looking for this guy I\\u2019m with. He sees us through the window and comes toward us. We\\u2019re frantically trying to run away - run up the stairs or run down the stairs and get out of the building. And the building is crashing around us. I run downstairs into a hallway and I see an arrow pointing to a sign with a name - Beth. Beth is a friend of mine in town - she\\u2019s a counselor. So I see an arrow to her house and I run to find her. She\\u2019s there and she walks with me to the top of the stairs. She stays with my son in a stroller at the top of the stairs. I run down the stairs. I have to go to the bathroom. I end up in this Japanese style bathroom with all these automatic toilets that I have lights and sing songs. You\\u2019re supposed to go to the bathroom in a particular way and push the right buttons so it cleans you in a particular way. So I do, but just as I\\u2019m finishing up, a whole group of photographers are standing right outside the door. They walk in and I\\u2019m not fully dressed again. I\\u2019m feeling ashamed of being caught with my pants down.\"],[\"I am with a group, a woman is in charge, we are doing or investigating something\\u2026.Just before others arrive, she brings in lots of weapons, shiny silver guns, etc\\u2026.It is not related, but the people will notice and ask why\\u2026.This is to deceive, distract them from our real mission\\u2026.I wonder if she needed to do this\\u2026.It is a big burden on her\\u2026.I am both impressed and worried for her\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with a woman, looking at a group bathroom where she lives, like at a dorm\\u2026.I ask which drawer is hers, or maybe she points it out to me\\u2026.It is the one at the top in the center, which seems like the least private; every other person using the sink will be right next to it\\u2026.But I say having that drawer makes it like your own bathroom, the best drawer of all\\u2026.That does make her a little happier\\u2026.I say I always try to figure out the best way to look at things, even if they are bad; in what way does this have advantages that others do not?....Later, my wife and I are trying to kiss, but we are worried she has blisters on her lips, a spreading of her shingles?....\"],[\"i am with blacks\"],[\"I am with Josh, my partner. I\\u2019m standing in the kitchen next to the sink. There\\u2019s a concrete floor. I\\u2019ve made a salad for both of us. Things are a little strained between us. I ask him if he wants to dress the salad. He goes to get the olive oil and he spills it everywhere on the floor. I\\u2019m extremely annoyed and upset about this. My reaction does not make sense for the mistake he made. He can see I\\u2019m made. I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cClean it up.\\u201d He goes outside to get a hose. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck is he doing? Get a rag to clean this up.\\u201d Somehow the oil is spreading. I watch him go outside. I can see a fig tree through the window. The window is the kind we have in Hawaii with the old panes of glass. There are all these huge gorgeous yummy figs on the tree and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I want to go pick those figs.\\u201d He\\u2019s out there getting the hose but he\\u2019s fucking around. Meanwhile the oil keeps spreading more and more. I don\\u2019t want to go out because I\\u2019d step in the oil and spread it some more. I can see there are chickens out there and the chickens keep trying to eat the figs. I yell at him through the window: \\u201cPick the figs!\\u201d He goes to pick them but he doesn\\u2019t have a basket to put them in. The chickens keep going after him. He\\u2019s still messing with the hose. Then he turns into my dad. He\\u2019s a bumbling idiot out there and I\\u2019m super frustrated with the whole thing. I leave the kitchen and all of a sudden I\\u2019m in a grocery store co-op. There are a ton of plants. Josh, who has turned into my dad, has the hose now and is trying to come into the house with it to clean up the oil and water the plants. I\\u2019m watching him walk through the kitchen into this back room that\\u2019s a co-op. In this backroom are tons of starts. He goes to water them, but he has the hose on super high pressure and he\\u2019s obliterating all the seedlings. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing? Where\\u2019s your common sense?\\u201d I\\u2019m so irate. At this point I just ignore him and the whole thing. I go into my room, but I don\\u2019t want it to be my room because it\\u2019s a smaller room. My sister is there but it\\u2019s not actually my sister, it\\u2019s another little girl who is my sister in this dream. She\\u2019s talking non-stop and I just want some space. I\\u2019m especially annoyed because she has the bigger bedroom and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do I have this little one?\\u201d She has this little piece of paper with a calendar on it. The calendar has been pulled out of a magazine and the magazine is the flyer or coupon book for the co-op. I don\\u2019t even know if the dates are right on the calendar, I think it\\u2019s last year. She\\u2019s pinned the calendar on the wall for me and I think that\\u2019s useful. But then I look at the dates and see that it\\u2019s not useful. She\\u2019s pinned it over the one window in my bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy have you pinned it over the window?\\u201d I go to pull it off and it has just regular blinds over the window. She goes, \\u201cBecause it stares into my room.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?!\\u201d Sure enough, I go and look and all I can see is her bedroom. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh yeah, let\\u2019s put curtains over that.\\u201d She goes to put a curtain over it and the curtain is the same color as the walls. The walls are a very light bright bluish green. I\\u2019m hating all of it. I don\\u2019t like this wall color, I don\\u2019t like this curtain and the curtain doesn\\u2019t , I don\\u2019t like the size of this room and I don\\u2019t like that she\\u2019s in here. This is not what I would choose for my space at all. Why the hell am I here? My mom comes in and is trying to smooth things over. I go outside. She follows me outside. We go outside because there is a gorgeous sunset happening and I want to catch the sunset. But I didn\\u2019t bring my phone or camera. I tell my little sister to grab my phone. I\\u2019m in my twenties or thirties and she\\u2019s six or seven. She takes her fucking time but by the time she comes back the sunset is gone. It was a beautiful glorious sunset. I try to pick a few of the figs for myself. Now I look up and in the night sky and I can see the Earth and Jupiter and Saturn making this cluster in the sky. I start taking pictures. I can see the continents, clouds and oceans of the Earth from where I\\u2019m standing, which I thought was earth, but apparently it\\u2019s not. Then to see Saturn and Jupiter, I think, \\u201cWell of course I can see them close together, it was the Great Conjunction.\\u201d All of a sudden Earth becomes a meteor and Jupiter and Saturn go with it. They start to burn up like when a meteor goes through Earth\\u2019s atmosphere. I\\u2019m panicking. I\\u2019m in the yard with the kids. I\\u2019m looking down and can see buildings like in a city. These two kids are Indian from India. They start to laugh as the Earth travels through the atmosphere and starts burning up. I\\u2019m horrified but they\\u2019re laughing like it\\u2019s the greatest prank in the world. Then I realize that it\\u2019s a ball and they somehow managed with magic to make it look like Earth and Jupiter and Saturn. It is going to burn up as it comes through the atmosphere and it will land and make an explosion, but it\\u2019s a ball because it stays the same size. They\\u2019re laughing hysterically because they\\u2019ve just pulled off this prank. I\\u2019m horrified because this entire dream I\\u2019ve just had this sense of where am I, why am I here, what am I doing...I\\u2019m trying to find bits of beauty, but I miss the sunset. I do see Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, but they seem to be fake. I go back into the co-op and the manager of the co-op is there now. The co-op is filled out now. I see grocery store shelves stocked with fruits and vegetables, and aisles with alternative flowers. The co-op manager is trying to hire people. He gets on the PA to talk about the benefits of working at the co-op. He says something like, \\u201cYou have at least one weekend day off.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cNo way! I would never work there.\\u201d I\\u2019m kind of laughing because he\\u2019s awkward on the PA system. But it does sound terrible the way he described it. The dream ends with me looking at him with a puzzled look on my face. My mom, dad and sister have all disappeared from the dream. There\\u2019s one other co-op employee hanging around and rolling his eyes as he hears the manager talk.\"],[\"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I\\u2019m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She\\u2019s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She\\u2019s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I\\u2019m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we\\u2019re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it\\u2019s men. We\\u2019re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila\\u2019s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We\\u2019re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it\\u2019s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I\\u2019m watching and I see Aila\\u2019s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it\\u2019s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I\\u2019m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it\\u2019s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it\\u2019s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It\\u2019s not quite a break wall because it doesn\\u2019t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I\\u2019m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He\\u2019s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They\\u2019re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I\\u2019m making sure they\\u2019re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It\\u2019s okay that they\\u2019re playing. I don\\u2019t have any concerns about who they\\u2019re playing with. I think that because I\\u2019m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They\\u2019re definitely working something out. I\\u2019m not concerned about that part at all. I\\u2019m just concerned that both children don\\u2019t drown. I\\u2019m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They\\u2019re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they\\u2019re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They\\u2019re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they\\u2019re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I\\u2019m watching this happen and by this time I\\u2019ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I\\u2019m concerned and don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. She says, \\u201cThe train was raided by these police officers.\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get to it. We weren\\u2019t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.\\u201d I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn\\u2019t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She\\u2019s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she\\u2019s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it\\u2019s the thing that she\\u2019s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.\"],[\"I am with my lover - it\\u2019s not anyone I recognize from real life. He has tan skin and these piercing blue eyes. He\\u2019s not 100% white, he\\u2019s definitely a person of color. I\\u2019m in his bedroom. I\\u2019m naked. He\\u2019s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I\\u2019m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It\\u2019s like it\\u2019s mine, but I\\u2019m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It\\u2019s weird and doesn\\u2019t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It\\u2019s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It\\u2019s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I\\u2019m on my back. I can see my lover and he\\u2019s over me. He has a fork. He\\u2019s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?\\u201d This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s what I want, let\\u2019s go for that.\\u201d Then I do this weird thing while I\\u2019m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they\\u2019re scratching my skin with the fork. It\\u2019s like some very strange BDSM play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYup, this is what I want. Go for it. It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d But the lucid part of me is like, \\u201cWhat the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?\\u201d I\\u2019m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I\\u2019m not enjoying at all. I\\u2019m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, \\u201cHere let me show you how to use your power now.\\u201d It\\u2019s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn\\u2019t. They say, \\u201cYeah okay, show us how.\\u201d They are truly wanting to learn. Somehow I have this queen-like presence, even though part of me sees this is not it. Then they are paid and they leave. Other people are showing up at the house, like we\\u2019re having a party. There are younger women - girls, maybe early 20s - who have shown up. I\\u2019m out on the back deck adjacent to the bedroom I was just in. The bedroom was huge with white gauzy curtains and the fancy netting over the bed. All the sheets and linens and carpet were white - everything was white in this room. I go out to the deck and some of these girls from the party show up. I\\u2019m switching out the rugs that were on the deck and right at the door to wipe your feet on. I\\u2019m showing these women how to pick the correct one that goes with the decor for this party.\"],[\"I am with my parents and we\\u2019re in a town that we\\u2019re visiting. My brothers are there, too, but not my sister. Events are happening in the town. We\\u2019re walking through the town with our tokens so we can take part in the events. I\\u2019m with my dad and we\\u2019re looking at a flyer that says something like: a couple tokens to do this talk with Mexican-Americans to hear their side of the story and get anti-racism training. My dad pays the money, but nothing happens and no one shows up. It\\u2019s a little mind boggling. We continue on and go see some other events. At one point, we\\u2019re in a car traveling and I\\u2019m the driver. I don\\u2019t know if I should be driving because I feel under the influence of something, not alcohol. I\\u2019ve got some friends in the back and maybe a sibling or two. At one part I drive over a bridge. The bridge is made of wood and it\\u2019s really, really high. I think there is water beneath the bridge. As I\\u2019m driving over it I think I should not be driving and I\\u2019m not safe to drive. We get over the bridge and I\\u2019m sweating because it\\u2019s freaking me out. We get to a downtown area where the buildings are close, the streets are narrow, and there are a lot of pedestrians. I\\u2019m very anxious to get the car parked back at the house becuase I\\u2019m scared I\\u2019m going to kill someone or everyone in the car. I still don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m on or why I have this anxiety around driving. Eventually we do get back to the house. I get out of the car. A bunch of people go inside. I go inside for a second. The house is interesting - it\\u2019s a very Victorian era looking house on the outside and inside. It\\u2019s got a lot of space - the ceilings are tall, which kind of contradicts the Victorian era architecture because the houses are usually kind of small on the inside. I\\u2019m inside for a little bit. I go to the backyard and the area where the Mexican-American anti-racism talk was supposed to happen is actually happening in the backyard. The landscape changes from town to lush woodland. The sign or billboard that announced the event is in the middle of the backyard. A tree is growing in the corner. I go hang out by this tree. The tree is actually a Mexican-American woman. I think she is Mexican-American, but she could be from some other part of South America, I\\u2019m not entirely sure, I just know she\\u2019s Latina. She has been in this tree the whole time. She comes out of the tree and we are dialoguing. She is scolding me for not doing what I was supposed to do in terms of my anti-racism work. But it\\u2019s more than that! As she becomes more human and less tree, the place where she was standing in the corner of the yard starts to fill with water. There\\u2019s a rocky waterfall in this back corner, too. I\\u2019m lying down on a mattress. I was trying to lie down under this tree while in conversation with this woman because there is something she\\u2019s supposed to be teaching me that I\\u2019m supposed to be learning. But where her roots were, the water keeps filling. At first it\\u2019s just a little trickle, and I scooch to the side to get out of the way. Then there\\u2019s more. The air mattress I was lying on starts to get soaked and I pull it out of the way. She is also trying to get out of the way. Then suddenly in this back corner of the yard that had nothing but this dry old tree woman is suddenly luscious and completely verdant. There are plants and ferns growing everywhere and there\\u2019s a spring where she was. The water is the sweetest water you\\u2019ve ever tasted; it\\u2019s so clear and refreshing. Now it\\u2019s overflowing out of the pond and moving down because this back corner of the yard was on top of a hill. So the water starts to flow down and it\\u2019s touching everything that was really dry. Everything about the town was also really dry - there weren't a lot of green growing things. So the water is moving down this hill and the whole backyard and surrounding areas change from this dry almost desert place to this green luscious verdant place. The whole backyard becomes a sanctuary. The tree woman and I keep trying to move out of the water, which is somehow creating a bond between us. In the beginning it was really hard for us to talk to each other; I was on the defence and she was attacking. But as we are together trying to move out of the water, there is a softening where she is more willing to talk to me and I\\u2019m not as scared to listen to her and hear what she has to say. We become friends. It\\u2019s interesting the way we start to weave together. We\\u2019re still in the backyard and there are also parrots with us. One of the parrots is talking to me. Eventually the woman wants to go walk downtown and go for dinner. We walk out together to the town. The town is actually kind of dirty and gross. We ask some people for directions to a really good dinner place. This guy tries to give us directions, then says, \\u201cNever mind, I\\u2019m just going to take you.\\u201d So he does. We follow him to this dinner place.\"],[\"I am with some people, I have a little ball and I want to roll it towards a wall and have it bounce back to me\\u2026.As part of a bigger process\\u2026.But I roll the ball too forcefully, and it does not go as I had hoped\\u2026.Lots of people are around, there is a good vibe, we are all doing something together\\u2026.\"],[\"I am with some people, trying to get our activities organized\\u2026.Everything in the room is black, the objects, the flowers\\u2026.At some point, a person eats a gummy candy, and later gets sick\\u2026.The powder of the candy is not good for you?....\"],[\"I am with someone on a beach\\u2026.They have a gun, and they are thinking about shooting other people\\u2026I say we did not fight World Wars I and II to let people just walking on the beach get shot at\\u2026.it is unclear if I am saying this, or if I am the person with the gun\\u2026.Then, everyone is in a white room, lots going on\\u2026.I am fooling around with a woman\\u2026.But she is later mistreated by others?....Later, someone has put a kind of magical love charm into an arrow tip?

I just make it up the stairs, slip in and shut the door. It\\u2019s night and something has been following me. People are inside making crafts at a table. My friend Elizabeth has kimono fabric and is pulling gold thread out of the fabric to use as thread for a doll dress. She\\u2019s helping me make one. As I try to shut the door, two feral dogs sneak in - one black and one white. I try to push them out the door. They push back in. I push them back out and am able to lock the door. But then they\\u2019re behind me in the house and I wonder how that happened. I unlock and open the door and push them back out. This happens several times until I realize they\\u2019ve been coming in through a broken screen. I see it hanging off its hinges. So I\\u2019m trying to get them out of the house and also fix the screen. It goes on and on and I\\u2019m getting really upset. I\\u2019m also a little afraid of these dogs and what they might do to me. Then somehow I keep them out. I\\u2019m sitting at the table with the old kimono fabric. Elizabeth gives me the gold thread with needle and I start sewing the pieces together. Then someone is in the back bedroom. I\\u2019m not sure if they are sick or if I am being taken to the dark room to be punished for doing something bad.\"],[\"I came up with the idea in a dream to write a story about a character becoming a cop in these times.\"],[\"I can barely remember but I can remember they are from established works.\"],[\"I can only recall theme's. Like if i am watching a war movie, i might dream about being in a war or battle, or if I am watching something scary, I will dream about being chased by a killer, or animal if that is the theme of the movie.\"],[\"I can only remember two bits from an extensive dream. I\\u2019m walking down a city street. There are steps leading up to a second story restaurant. It\\u2019s an elegant cafe. I go up the stairs with my son. It\\u2019s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I\\u2019m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we\\u2019ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I\\u2019ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he\\u2019s gone. He\\u2019s not on the stairs. I\\u2019m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don\\u2019t know where he\\u2019s gone. In another scene, I\\u2019m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I\\u2019m at the baths. I\\u2019m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She\\u2019s watching the cat while the cat\\u2019s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I\\u2019m trying to pretend that I don\\u2019t know Ursula so that the woman doesn\\u2019t connect me with Ursula\\u2019s former apprentice.\"],[\"I can see a pair of motorcycles and a thing that has three wheels, like the comfy ride for old people who want to ride motorcycles, but can\\u2019t stay on two wheels. I\\u2019m observing all of this and don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m in this part of the dream. So these two women riding these motorcycles are pretty fucking badass and I\\u2019m just watching them. They\\u2019re going pretty fast. There\\u2019s a dude in this three-wheeler behind them. He\\u2019s kind of reckless and pushing him from behind. They\\u2019re weaving in and out of cars and traffic. The feeling of it is really dangerous. There aren\\u2019t a lot of cars. The road itself is going through wheat fields and forest on the other side of the road. The terrain keeps changing as everyone is speeding through this. There\\u2019s also a bus behind that\\u2019s kind of following. I\\u2019m going back and forth between hovering over the motorcycles watching and being in the bus and talking to the bus driver. I\\u2019m watching these motorcycles and at one point I see the guy in the three-wheeler veer off into a wheat field and destroy a bunch of the wheat. Then he comes back onto the road and is still behind these women. The feeling of this part is really intense - the sounds of the motorcycles are really loud in my ear. The wheels of the motorcycles and the three-wheeler are cartoonishly big. There are other passengers in the bus. The inside of the bus is like a school bus, the way the seats are set up, but the outside of the bus doesn\\u2019t look like a school bus. I don\\u2019t know who the bus driver is - it\\u2019s not somebody I recognize. He has a wise demeanor about him - he has the feeling of being a guide in this dream. I\\u2019m watching and then the scene cuts away into some sort of night club or bar. I\\u2019m leaning against a bar and talking to these two men whose eyes are a light piercing blue with a light behind them. There\\u2019s definitely flirting going on between us. There\\u2019s a mirror behind the bartender where all the alcohol is sitting on shelves. It\\u2019s dim inside. I know that the people on the motorcycles are safe and fine. I see that the guy that was pushing them on is back on the bus. The bus is now a lab and he\\u2019s standing in this metal cage with rings. The metal cage is very close to his body but not actually touching him. There\\u2019s one ring around his knees, another around his hips and another around his chest. His hands are tied behind him and his body is all bruised. His hair is red. His skin is pretty pale. He\\u2019s yelling as if there\\u2019s some sort of punishment happening to him in this bus that has turned into a lab. So one part of my attention is on that and another part of my attention is with these two guys. It almost feels like they\\u2019re trying to distract me from what\\u2019s happening to this other dude in the bus. I keep seeing electricity coming out from the contraption that he\\u2019s in and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s making him scream. Then just like a scene fades in a movie, the lights go down on the guy in the bus/lab. The lights were an eerie blue and then they fade away totally. I\\u2019m left in the bar and the lights have a red tinge even though they\\u2019re dim.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t find my husband. I\\u2019m at some kind of party at a country club or public pool. First I get a video call from my mom and sister. She\\u2019s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She\\u2019s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I\\u2019m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I\\u2019m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he\\u2019s actually swimming. He\\u2019s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I\\u2019m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can\\u2019t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I\\u2019m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he\\u2019s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I\\u2019m so mad at him. And he\\u2019s just shrugging me off. He tells me that he\\u2019s been doing other stuff, too, and not telling me about it: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been drinking six cups of coffee a day, drinking beer everyday, getting high everyday and smoking cigarettes again. I\\u2019ve been hiding from you the whole time because I know how upset you get.\\u201d I\\u2019m so mad that I want to beat him up. The woman comes back. She\\u2019s watching and smoking. She has tattoos all over her body and they aren\\u2019t well done or tastefully designed. She lifts up her shirt to show her belly. I can see she is very far along. The baby is lying sideways which isn\\u2019t good. I\\u2019m continuing to get more mad. She asks him where to send the invoice for the cigarettes. He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It\\u2019s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It\\u2019s \\u201cWhyNotHard\\u201d or \\u201cWhyNot&Hard\\u201d or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I\\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. I\\u2019m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he\\u2019s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we\\u2019re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together. One of them starts to sing and tells me she\\u2019s been watching and listening to the whole drama. She\\u2019s laughing because she\\u2019s been there before. They are all singing a song and the scene shifts. It\\u2019s like we are in a music video. We are standing under trees by a body of water. There are brown leaves covering the ground. I see an ice blue woman naked and lying partially hidden under the leaves. I wonder if she is me. I can\\u2019t recall what happens next. But then I am trying to teach a yoga class to a group of people who are wanting really advanced trick poses. I can do and teach these poses but I want to slowly warm them up and prepare them to do it safely. But, nobody is really paying attention. They have this better than thou attitude that turns me off. I don't want to continue teaching to people who are so disrespectful.\"],[\"I can\\u2019t remember\"],[\"I can\\u2019t remember\"],[\"I can\\u2019t remember right now\"],[\"I choose not to disclose that information.\"],[\"I definitely had a dream about the coronavirus, but I can't remember the details.

I was a woman and I was being shown half of a house, a duplex. It wasn\\u2019t nighttime yet but not daytime - dusk and gray. It was a craftsman type house with a lot of wood details, and someone was showing me room to room to room. I was part of a couple but the man was never home. Another couple moved in and I thought they were moving into the adjacent duplex side of the house but they insisted on living on my side.

First point of view was from a distance, like from a car across the street, then it just showed them taking her down and out of the building, and restarted inside the building to the second point of view from one of the men moving her. I could see her clothing but not her face, it was vintage late 70\\u2019s style. Again, I was just taking her downstairs only thumping her body down each step this time.

Gail\\u2019s oldest daughter is picking at the table and ruining it. Gai\\u2019s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She\\u2019s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks.

The waiter comes by and has a thick Irish accent. I order fries and then my mom orders. Then the waiter and the man start talking with each other in Gaelic. I\\u2019m wanting to interrupt so I can speak and learn the language again. The guy at my table is reading a poem. I ask if the word means garter as I make a motion of pulling a garter up over my leg. They look at me and laugh as if humoring me. They are laughing as if it was some sort of sexual innuendo that I didn\\u2019t catch. The waiter disappears and doesn\\u2019t return to our table. He has to declare bankruptcy but is being hunted down for money he owes. I find him in a crowded cafe with multiple serving stations. He\\u2019s making eggs with parmesan cheese to serve and judged. If he gets the cooking job, he\\u2019ll be able to pay his bills. I join him at the stove and help plate the eggs. I see a pile of powdered sugar on the plate, but think it should be on the dessert plate instead. His girlfriend is also helping. I scoop up the powdered sugar but don\\u2019t have a place for it while she plops savory sauce on the plate. It\\u2019s messy but it tastes good.

He says, \\u201cWell that\\u2019s Jeremy\\u2019s story to tell,\\u201d as if he somehow knows. He goes into the kitchen to get himself a refill of tea, but not me.

People are lined up outside in two lines for the two different dining areas. I slip inside to go to the bathroom and then look in one of the rooms.

I just join the line in front rather than go to the end. We go in and they\\u2019re seating people at tables. I\\u2019m by myself so I can choose wherever I want to sit. I sit at one place and don\\u2019t like it, then try another place and don\\u2019t like it, then another place.

Sometimes characters from movies, TV shows or celebrities appear in them. Most often it is me being immersed in their world (like working with the people from Criminal Minds or consulting people from NCIS). Sometimes it is normal every day situations and they will \\\"pop\\\" into my dream like going grocery shopping and run into Danny Devito and end up having a normal conversation with them.\"],[\"I have a mentoring meeting with one of my clients. I\\u2019ve ridden my bike to her place and park it in the garage. She meets me there. We\\u2019re talking about whatever it is she needs to talk about it. We go upstairs into her apartment and we have our session. She\\u2019s talking about actually having another baby with her partner, which is a big deal because it would have to be in vitro fertilization. She already has another child who is a little bit older. At a certain point she has to go pick them up, so we end our session after talking. She goes into her bedroom and grabs another child - a younger child, a little black orphan baby that she has adopted. It was not an infant, maybe 3 or 4 or 5, had been sleeping in the bedroom the whole time and I didn\\u2019t know. She puts the child in a front carrier, straps in, and heads out. We\\u2019re both heading out back down the stairs from her apartment to her garage where my bike is and her car is. I\\u2019m just surprised that there was another child in the apartment the whole time and apparently sleeping, but it didn\\u2019t come up in our conversation either. I thought it was so strange. She goes out. She leaves with her other child to pick up her child from school. I get my bike and start riding it down the street because I\\u2019m heading towards an Imbolc festival. As I\\u2019m riding my bike, I get off and walk. I\\u2019m walking down the main street that I grew up on in my childhood. I\\u2019m seeing the mountains to my right - they\\u2019re beautiful, covered in green grass and I can see the tree line. Then of course I can see all of the houses - the regular neighborhoods that I passed every day in my childhood. I\\u2019m heading down to the high school I went to as I was growing up and that is where the festival is. So I cross the little bridge that has a stream under it and I take a right into the school and I make it right past the cattle gate into the main entrance and set my bike down. I also have this strange lingering feeling that I have my own children I\\u2019m supposed to be watching. They show up at the school and I take them in and bring them through the entrance where I pay for admission. My old mentor who I learned some of my priestessing skills in my priestess apprenticeship is there. She is there to take us all on a guided journey before I get into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s me and whoever else has shown up at the entrance of the gate, which I find interesting because she\\u2019s only taking the people who have been trained as priestesses to go do this meditation, and two of the other women that I see there - besides the women I went through the program with - are actually high school classmates of mine who tell me, \\u201cOh yeah, we started this program five years ago. We\\u2019ve always been priestesses.\\u201d I\\u2019m really shocked because I didn\\u2019t see them the entire time I was on the program and also I feel a little bit betrayed, like I had been told that the group of us that had been going through the program was it and to find out there were other people that we didn\\u2019t know about in our spiral is very disturbing to me. We lay down anyway and we\\u2019re going through this meditation. I can hear my mentor\\u2019s voice and she says very specific words, which I cannot remember now. But there\\u2019s also a part where she sprinkles turmeric and saffron over us - those are the two herbs we are meant to be using with this meditation. And then I can feel my body taking in the herbs, taking in the words - there\\u2019s definitely a change in what feels like my consciousness and my field. When it\\u2019s done, I get up and I know it\\u2019s time for me to leave. I\\u2019m not supposed to stay there with the other priestesses or the people she had brought in to do this blessing. I head into the rest of the festival. It\\u2019s interesting, I can see yellow tulips everywhere. These tulips seem to be playing an important part of this Imbolc festival. Then I leave because I\\u2019m still so upset about these two women who were my high school classmates who also suddenly turned out to be these priestesses that I didn\\u2019t know that they were. They have some disdain and contempt for me because I had left the path early and I don\\u2019t like any of it. So I leave the festival and somehow the scene changes completely. I\\u2019m in a home with my mom and my dad and my dad is trying to keep the inside of the house - I think it was supposed to be my childhood home - he\\u2019s trying to keep it in order, keep it clean. My mom is in another section of the house - her office - and there\\u2019s her and a bunch of people in it and they\\u2019re all brainstorming jobs - how to work, how to make money. They\\u2019re making the assumption that I\\u2019m part of it, I\\u2019m going to start working it. But I\\u2019m actually in the office trying to brainstorm my own programs, my own classes, my own way to get more clients. They keep including me in their discussion and finally I get really pissed off and start yelling. I grab their papers they\\u2019ve been writing on and tear them up, rip them up. They finally say oh, okay, she\\u2019s not going to help with that and they go back to writing on their whiteboards brainstorming. I\\u2019m so annoyed that I get up and head out to a restaurant that they apparently also own. I can\\u2019t tell if both my parents own it or just one, but I go to the restaurant and there\\u2019s this pressure on me to help work in that restaurant too and I do not want to, but I do need money. So I go into the restaurant and it\\u2019s interesting because a different classmate is a server in the restaurant and there\\u2019s another man - two men are in there. They sit me down and they walk me through the way this restaurant works and how the emphasis is on kindness to the employees, which is so different from the restaurant experience I have where everyone is cutthroat and the chefs brandish knives at you and whatnot. So they are explaining to me how the restaurant works and how my duties would be as manager and how little I would have to do. I\\u2019m still not sold, I don\\u2019t want to work at a restaurant, I\\u2019ve already done that. While we\\u2019re sitting down at the meeting, people are coming into the restaurant and eating. Things are flowing. I can hear glasses clinking and silverware being used and orders being yelled out and lots of conversation. I look to my right and there\\u2019s this huge square table with 12 people sitting at it and they\\u2019re singing to a cat trying to communicate to the cat to do something. The cat is actually responding to it - it reminds me of snake charmers and all of these students know exactly what they\\u2019re doing. They\\u2019re communicating to this cat through singing, all 12 of them, and they are getting the cat to do what they want it to do and I\\u2019m just fascinated watching this happen. Then my attention goes back to the two guys I\\u2019m in the meeting with and I just tell them, \\u201cit\\u2019s lovely, you\\u2019re lovely, the restaurant seems lovely. The restaurant seems to run quite well, but I\\u2019m not interested. I don\\u2019t want to work in a restaurant.\\u201d Then the scene changes again, but I\\u2019ve forgotten the rest of the dream.\"],[\"I have an orange football helmet, with some other equipment\\u2026.it is newly painted, and has no team insignia on it?....the paint looks cheap, tacky, not smooth; an amateur job, not for professional use\\u2026.Later, I leave a room with other people in it, and we have something that other people want\\u2026.a long white object, plastic or wood?\\u2026.I put it on a book shelf and try to cover it with handfuls of dirt\\u2026.hmm, that does not seem to work well\\u2026.they will still be able to see it\\u2026.I think of putting a blanket over the book shelf, a brown one, to cover the whole thing\\u2026.But they would definitely notice that\\u2026.hmm, what to do\\u2026.Earlier, the Divinity School professors are trying to guide me in how to divide up the night into different dream parts\\u2026.\"],[\"I have but I don't remember specifics now\"],[\"I have come up with a way of responding to the crisis\\u2026.A strange ball made of four natural elements, kinds of plants\\u2026.It does well, I am happy with it\\u2026.A plant vine, like a long line of string, is wrapped around it, when the ball goes off or activates, that vine withers and dies\\u2026.it has to be replaced each time\\u2026.\"],[\"I have dreamed about the chaos and destruction created by these racially motivated hate groups.

There\\u2019s a look in her eyes that is familiar to me. Her birthday was 6/21 but we didn\\u2019t really talk. The emotion is kind of lonely and scary.\"],[\"I have tickets to go to a show and the show is tonight. Before going to the show, I go to a bar and meet up with some friends. Then I go back to the house - it\\u2019s a communal house that I share with a lot of different people. I decide to go to the show. I stop at a health/art fair. People are getting their hair and makeup done, and I wait to have mine done, too. I wander around looking at art. There are huge beautiful pieces and odd pieces. People are wandering around looking, too. Then I look at the time and I realize I need to get the show. It\\u2019s 11pm but still twilight. I realize I am too late for the show.\"],[\"I have to deal with Voldemort\\u2026.It has been a while since I have had to think about him\\u2026.I have forgotten about all his evil activities\\u2026.I wonder if he will notice me\\u2026.I am afraid he will\\u2026.\"],[\"I have two black converse shoes on\\u2026I look down, and see they are slightly different shoes\\u2026.That is weird\\u2026.later, I am on a plane, sitting in the right aisle by the window, and a flight attendant asks me if I am ok\\u2026.Yes, I have a bag of snack food and a People magazine, I am all good\\u2026.I realize she is trying to flirt with me?....I suppose I do look good, sitting there in a black t-shirt with my dark glasses\\u2026.At some point, on a beach perhaps, I try to pick up a small snake\\u2026.It grabs around my hand aggressively\\u2026.Earlier, I am with other people, trying to help someone who is ill\\u2026.But it turns out that one of the people helping is ill, too\\u2026.Last scene, I am with Vladamir Putin, having a meeting, inside a dark brown wood paneled room\\u2026.I am the President, hosting him\\u2026.I say, do you prefer using first names, or our titles, when we speak?....He says titles\\u2026.OK, Mr. Prime Minister, I say, would you like a glass of water?....\"],[\"I help some people create shrines where important things have happened\\u2026.First is at the far side house, outside near the driveway\\u2026.There is a big pile of old stuff to get rid of\\u2026.Then a place where people have an important book\\u2026.Then a place where they gathered\\u2026.That seems better, a more positive energy to the place and shrine\\u2026.With these places, people are adding that energy to it\\u2026.Although we do not get to any here, I think of how some places have that energy naturally\\u2026.At some point, Abraham Lincoln is there, on horseback\\u2026.He changes sides at one point, which seems historically accurate, but makes everything more confusing\\u2026.\"],[\"I hooked up with princess leia on the Corillian Corvette while shooting imperials\"],[\"I imagined three young black men beating Trump under the wheel.\"],[\"I just cannot run or walk.

I\\u2019ve worn these diamond earrings every day since I was 16. I\\u2019m really sad and panicked. I look down in the sink and see the silver back of the earring clinking and sliding down into the sink basin. Then I\\u2019m disgusted. Also in the sink is pinky peachy frothy vomit. I think my diamond could be under the vomit. I don\\u2019t want to touch the vomit, but I have to get it right away, or my diamond will slip down the drain. So I get a sieve or colander and I scoop all of the vomit out of the sink. I shake it a bit and the vomit sieves through the holes back into the sink.

I remember the tree throwing apples at me. I can't recall the rest of the dream\"],[\"I once had a dream that darth Vader jumped out of my closet and hit me with his lightsaber.\"],[\"I only remember a snippet of this dream. I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It\\u2019s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I\\u2019m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I\\u2019m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It\\u2019s warm so I don\\u2019t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I\\u2019m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I\\u2019ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I\\u2019m headed back in their direction. As I\\u2019m walking down the street, I\\u2019m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There\\u2019s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there\\u2019s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there\\u2019s very tall windows - they\\u2019re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it\\u2019s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I\\u2019m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I\\u2019m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She\\u2019s talking to her daughter. She\\u2019s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there\\u2019s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that\\u2019s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I\\u2019m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I\\u2019m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There\\u2019s an awkwardness now because I don\\u2019t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She\\u2019s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I\\u2019ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I\\u2019m wearing doesn\\u2019t have any pockets and I also suddenly can\\u2019t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I\\u2019m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I\\u2019m so distraught and I wonder if it\\u2019s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don\\u2019t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.\"],[\"I only remember images ... of Brad Pitt ...

The back bedroom was tiny and the geometric print on the floor was the same as the cabinet and it was supposed to be the kids\\u2019 room but there were no toys and it was completely empty. We left through the back door when the man came home. We got to the movie theater and ordered red wine and when we sat down, there was a young woman between us and I realized she was the mistress. I (the person) was mad, and she acted like she had a right to be there. She had a round face and brown shoulder length hair. Again it was me but it wasn\\u2019t me.

It looked like Chicago but I\\u2019ve never been there. It was dark/night and we were going out dancing. I was with a friend but also on a date with a guy. It was like an 80s movie. We went to a bar and by the end we had sung karaoke and ripped up our dresses - suddenly I was wearing a long wedding dress and it was ripped to my knees and glitter/color all over it like a Cyndi Lauper video or something. It was free and happy and lighthearted but there was an element of danger lurking.\"],[\"I was a younger black teenager and I challenged my older brother to a fight and I knocked myself out into the wall. I was narrating like a movie.\"],[\"I was almost like trapped in a housing complex. Where every house was the same. I was supposed to sell the houses to new members of the community. It was all brown people from different ethnic backgrounds. I was taught how to do the job but I wasn\\u2019t doing it well. There was this Beautiful man, Naveen Andrews, that lives there and he was helping me get acclimated. There were seminars every day in the courtyard. Everyone was so calm and collected and moved so gracefully. I didn\\u2019t. My stuff was everywhere. My motorcycle was in the middle of the impeccably landscaped garden and I had to move it out during a seminar and it was so distracting and noisy and awkward. I had my first tour I was giving and I had all the paperwork for each person and they all were completely different but I could only remember one name and I kept calling them all the same name, Sheera. I was so embarrassed. I sold one house to one of the people who was In love with Naveen. She also hated me for being so close with him.\"],[\"I was at a beach with a couple of friends and the only one I recognize is my friend, who is a lifestyle dom and I\\u2019ve really had a good time observing her and working with her and getting to know about being a dom from her. In the dream we are at the ocean. We\\u2019re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it\\u2019s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I\\u2019m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She\\u2019s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I\\u2019m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We\\u2019re on a culdesac. It\\u2019s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I\\u2019m not sure whose. I\\u2019m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it\\u2019s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I\\u2019m not sure. There are adults and kids. I\\u2019m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I\\u2019m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I\\u2019m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cCould you hurry up? You\\u2019re taking a long time and why do you need that?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBecause I like it.\\u201d Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn\\u2019t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don\\u2019t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there\\u2019s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn\\u2019t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, \\u201cWhy am I taking off this thing that I like?\\u201d I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn\\u2019t like it and was all judgmental about it. The dream ends there with that going through my head.\"],[\"I was at a hospital training on a surgical unit. The patients were hoisted up into the ceiling rather than on beds and I was being trained how to clean them before they were discharged. It involved spray and turning myself clockwise once. I don\\u2019t remember much else except that I was wearing blue scrubs, not my teal scrubs\"],[\"I was at a house in the kitchen and I\\u2019ve never been there before. It was older and everything was worn down and white but cared for- my ex was there and he was angry. I don\\u2019t know why. I was cleaning up a broken garbage bag on the floor and trying to put everything inside of the next one and it kept poking through and I realized they were brooms and brushes and of course they would poke through. Someone came to the door and it was a whole group of people who were actually banging on the door. There was a redhead woman wearing a pink dress and I think she was a trans woman and she said she needed to marry her wife and now she couldn\\u2019t. The men behind her looked threatening and we let her inside.\"],[\"i was at a protest like the one i really attended but when the cops threw the gas i wasnt prepared like i was in real life and it hurt so bad and i fell and they arrested me. i was crying and asking them what i did but they wouldnt listen\"],[\"I was at a protest/march/action in an urban street setting, surrounded by buildings. It was getting dark (sun down). I was trying to help someone with something.\"],[\"I was at a small bar concert or something and the woman who cuts my hair was a proxy for me to buy cowboy boots and jeans. It was night.\"],[\"I was at what was supposed to be my unit but it was on the first floor of some place and much larger and spread out, much nicer. There was a patient I\\u2019ve had dreams about before (about driving around in circles in a yellow van and another strapped down in makeshift restraints). In this dream I walked in and the attending was taking vitals - it wasn\\u2019t the one that works with them at all on the unit and it seemed off because attendings don\\u2019t take vitals. I could tell the attending was nervous and there was tension, like the attending just wanted to leave the room. I tried to engage with them and we went outside and there were big balls splattered with blue and red paint and we kicked them back and forth; and they liked it because it looked like blood. They were asking me personal questions that I was trying to avoid. Eventually I excused myself and went to sleep in the next room.\"],[\"I was at work and my colleague erased my quote from the board...I wasn\\u2019t mad I was just confused\"],[\"I was at work and there were three computers and I had to put my password into the computer where everyone could see it. The unit secretary reminded me to check the box for the \\u201cwasher-dryer\\u201d to give myself access (not sure what this means) and there were options for all kinds of things that didn\\u2019t apply to my job. Patients were being wheeled in and I looked at my watch and it was on but the clock face was facing down so all I saw was the back of the watch. A patient came in in restraints like you see in the movies (not like we actually have) and he was sitting up in a chair and basically the chair had wood and he was strapped to the wood. He looked over at me with such vitriol but I could see he wasn\\u2019t really there and I wanted to take off the restraints. At the same time I felt he was dangerous (something I don\\u2019t often feel). He was white with brown wavy medium length hair, maybe early twenties. He creeped me out. He looks like someone we have on unit who is not as acute. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was at work and trying to get ready for a group. The hallways were cluttered and there were people everywhere and visitors (which we don\\u2019t have anymore). I went out to the waiting area and it was like a completely different hospital. I saw a guy and asked him if there\\u2019s anything else I could do - just to be nice. He said he wanted a map. I pointed him in the direction of the station for guest services and then I went over to the guest service station. But somebody cut me off and I had to wait to get them up and she told me it was because she had an appointment and she was a billion package. I was annoyed but I waited so I got him set up to leave the hospital. Then I went back on my unit to get ready and everyone was due to me, so I was trying to assess people and invite them down to group. People were on computers in the group room which is also not a thing that we have, but I had to manually turn them off. Somebody got physical with me and I had to put my arm out to protect myself. In the dream I was angry and tired and impatient but pretending that I wasn\\u2019t and that\\u2019s how I feel a lot in real life right now. I\\u2019m really tired and a lot of people are asking me for things and I have nothing to give.\"],[\"I was at work on the voluntary side, although it didn\\u2019t really look like it does now - it was much bigger. I was holding an impromptu group with a couple folks. Two women and one man came over and we were doing a beading exercise and nursing him to get them to go do other things. I was left with the gentleman and one of his nurses came through but she was wheeling a walking wheelchair and she was like, \\u201coh this is a much better fit than what I had to use yesterday.\\u201d I forget what she was in yesterday, but in my dream it was somewhat adaptive, and I turned to him and I said, \\u201cIt never worked out well.\\u201d My dad worked at the hospital when I was a kid and he was a veteran. In my dream this guy trusted me more. Then we lined everybody up to go back to the involuntary side and there were these two double doors and this big bright light. I had to keep opening the badge to let people through without the thing buzzing - similar to what we have but the bright light was really strange.\"],[\"I was at work. I kept logging onto the computers to turn the chart and do things and these cartoons kept coming up. Then my colleague Susan came in, but she wasn\\u2019t wearing her scrubs. Her student Lana came and she and I were watching Susan run a group. I had to keep turning south of people so they couldn\\u2019t see me typing on the screen. When I went back to the computer, I saw there was some dancing on the screen and a place like Shambhala and a voice said, \\u201clet\\u2019s give a dance to the creator.\\u201d I remember feeling annoyed by this but don\\u2019t know why.\"],[\"I was being chased by somebody or something and running from building to building and then I kind of melted into the second dream where I had my dog Pinto in his stroller and we were meeting my family for a Christmas show. We took an elevator to the top floor of what looks like the space needle in Seattle and we sat down at the end of this crescent shaped couch. I kind of had a bad view of the play or festivities, but then an unattractive guy sat down next to me. He was black and tall and wearing a gray sweater and jeans and boots. He was sitting with people that he knew. We all said hello and then we went around and said our names twice. The play started and I couldn\\u2019t see my family but I was okay and somehow the guy next to me put his arm around me and started kissing me. He was a really good kisser and in my dream I remember thinking it\\u2019s been so long and I was embarrassed because I felt like there was so much spit in my mouth! I eventually excused myself to use the restroom but before I did I looked down and my nipple was showing! I left Pinto there in the stroller while I went to the bathroom and I was gone for a while, maybe seven or eight minutes, and I was blowing my nose trying to get the last of everything out because my nose was running. When I went back I was worried about having left him alone for so long and then the person next to me wasn\\u2019t there anymore but it was okay. The show was almost over and then I woke up\"],[\"I was closer to the top of the water and then on top of the water. I\\u2019m not watching from the boat, maybe on a dock? I was with my ex Rory and he was judging these people and their kids as they were getting out their slide for the boat. They had a little kid and a very short slide. The little kid had some kind of floaty device on his left leg. Every time somebody went down the slide it got longer. I had to explain this to him and he finally understood and was less judgmental.\"],[\"I was doing something with my sister Liz who is older and we were having an outdoor party and there were configurations of people and we needed to figure out where they were going to be under the tent. She changed it and told everybody about it and took credit for changing it. For some reason this annoyed me and in real life this is something she would do and I would let it go because I don\\u2019t care. We were serving American food and Indian food and I don\\u2019t know why it was a big deal or a faux pas but it was definitely a problem to combine the two. I think there were fireworks too and the whole dream was at night.\"],[\"I was down by the ocean and it was another time. I was alone and there was no beach to sit on, just small patches of rock with some exposed sand. Everyone knew each other but I didn\\u2019t. The first part of the dream I met this guy and we dated briefly. I don\\u2019t remember his face or anything. He had an annoying brother who looked like a Jonas brother and a loud car. It reminded me a bit of the feeling of this fling I had in college after my mom died with a guy who raced cars. I know this is going nowhere but whatever. Very unintentional, not something I would do now. When we broke up he took my phone and dropped it down the stairs and it dropped way down and I was on my knees scrambling to find the pieces. I was mad.\"],[\"I was dreaming that I was in this cabin with 5 or 6 different people I didn't know\"],[\"I was driving down this road going over the speed limit. The sign said 50, although it was in a neighborhood so I knew it was over, and I missed a stop sign. It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow\\u2019s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I\\u2019ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids. Then I went to drive around looking for a gift of plates but all of the stores were closed. I remember bashing Trump in a few conversations.\"],[\"I was driving in the same universe but in a car. I stopped into a small town and it was snowing. There was a movie theater and a menswear shop. I went into the shop and saw a friend of a friend who I knew from working in San Francisco a long time ago. I haven\\u2019t seen or thought of them in years. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was driving to a concert at night with ex boyfriend Rory and when we arrived it was my late husband Caleb singing. I think it was the afterlife. There was a woman singing and she was really into it. She said \\u201cI think I remember you from last time\\u201d and I introduced myself as Caleb\\u2019s wife and her face fell. Her name was Dawn Jo. It was dark. She looked concerned but I wasn\\u2019t at all.\"],[\"I was friends with the characters of harry potter\"],[\"I was getting people to come march with me who used to be friends with me and who I had hoped would be more interested in civil rights.\"],[\"I was getting ready for work and a colleague was with her family showing up by the telephone pole in a neighborhood and her brother was like, \\u201chey I know you,\\u201d and it made me want to run away.\"],[\"I was going to talk with this older guy, but I was not really interested in him. He seemed nice though so I thought I would try. He lived on campus, maybe he was a teacher or something. I was definitely not me. I went to his apartment and we had dinner and eventually started to kiss. It was a nice concert and I remember taking our shirts off and then I left to go for some fresh air and I left him waiting for me for a long time. Then I went to this big brick courtyard and all of these people came. There were multiple layers and then all these black bars started closing in like we were getting locked down and somebody handed me a little toy truck to place and wedge in the door so that we could keep the door open. It was a young guy so I did that. And then I got free and I went down to the bottom level and there was this overgrown garden and all these people and there were these fish swimming without water and they were clear like puffy fish, kind of scary looking. They were all over the grass but they were swimming and on top of the grass and they were using the very length of their body to propel them forward. I remember being scared of them. I couldn\\u2019t tell if they were jellyfish or what they were and I had big wide open eyes. There were also regular animals, like ducks and squirrels. I was all over the place trying to get out of there. And then there was this other guy that I came across while I was running away and he caught me in my game and said, \\u201cha ha, I know you\\u2019re running away you\\u2019re gonna wait for me, too,\\u201d and then he took me back around the front of the building and that\\u2019s when I saw the first guy I ran away from and he told me how hurt he was.\"],[\"I was having a dream of an actor, John.

It\\u2019s never a horrific crash, but there\\u2019s always damage to the car and I\\u2019m going to get in trouble for driving a car like this.\"],[\"I was in a dimly lit yoga class in what looked like a barn or wooden room and there was a front section for people who could practice on a mat and I was in the back on a seated section where it was darker.

I saw these guys playing basketball with their shirts off and was aroused. I realized I was rooming with them. I went to go get dinner and it spilled all over me; this one guy came to talk to me and we started to hit it off but then he was telling me about two failed marriages and how awful all of his exes were and it was such an icky familiar feeling. He was white with thick brown hair, probably in his forties and built well for his age, very east coast. But I was like \\u201cnope!\\u201d Then a younger black guy came to sit with me and he was sharing that he is a doctor at NYU and basically prequalifying me about my masters and asking if I was going to do my PhD. I felt overwhelmed and left to take a shower. I was trying to get undressed without being seen, in a thick towel in this big shared room. I looked out the window and it was New York or something and I saw hand prints on the window of a neighboring building and skeletons but thought maybe they were Halloween decorations. When I went to go back downstairs I was at my job now and going to the OT room to get my cart and get the group ready. \\u201cNo Diggity\\u201d was playing on the radio.

I make it to this one level. It\\u2019s pretty high up. I can see out the windows and all I can see is clouds. I can\\u2019t even see the ground. There is green lightning outside. I\\u2019m still running away from this guy and he\\u2019s definitely chasing me. I make it to this place that is all windows and I can see in all directions from where I am in this room. There\\u2019s a table in the center of the room. I\\u2019m making an altar with crystals. If I can make this crystal grid and turn it on fast enough, then I can transport myself out of this. But my brother is there and he\\u2019s slowing me the fuck down. I need two of the crystals that he has. They\\u2019re tiny -the size of my pinky fingernail. They are shaped like triangles and black obsidian. He has those two stones and they\\u2019re his. I have them in my hand and he comes running up and says, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t use my stones to get out of here. You\\u2019re not allowed to get out of here.\\u201d He\\u2019s somehow on Voldemort's side?! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, we have to get out of here! Or at least I have to. I don\\u2019t care if you like working for this guy and this is your jam. Cool. But I\\u2019m not staying.\\u201d But he keeps taking his stones off the grid so I can\\u2019t complete the grid and I can see Voldemort in his robes and walking down the hall towards me. His robes are flapping. Now there\\u2019s lightning outside and it\\u2019s getting very dramatic. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I cannot finish the grid because my brother keeps taking his stones out and I don\\u2019t have enough time to activate it. It\\u2019s like I get a few seconds with the stones on the grid and then he takes them and I can\\u2019t do it again. The dream ends with me being terrified and freaked out that I\\u2019m going to be stuck as a prisoner of this tower forever, and frustrated because I can\\u2019t get the grid to go. I know how to do this kind of magic and it shouldn\\u2019t be this hard for me.\"],[\"I was in a yoga studio and crammed in trying to go to class and I couldn\\u2019t see the teacher and I was annoyed at the people around me because they were acting really immature.\"],[\"I was in an anteroom of sorts getting ready to see Ram Dass. An attendant sat with me and I washed and we sat. Then I went to a room and he was in a bed with only his head propped up. The bed was a four-poster and the headboard was like a gold metal shell behind him. I sat down on the floor and he asked about playing a card game. I didn\\u2019t like it - was short and long at the same time. Other fragments: dark New York City passages from target and apartment buildings to each other running from police. A foursome in a bathroom in a public place, but it was like a regular bathroom. Big boxes. A drive through. Rory\\u2019s dad was in a bathroom and we had to take a picture with him like Santa and it was the worst and there was all kinds of family history.\"],[\"I was in Asia and in a crowded bustling city at night. I was with two companions but they didn\\u2019t talk to me. I had several iPhones. We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I\\u2019m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn\\u2019t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn\\u2019t have it. I was staying alone in a hotel room that was like a train compartment and then it was dark and raining. I woke up sweating.\"],[\"I was in Germany while the Berlin Wall was still up; I was marching with other protesters calling for a united Germany, free movement, and the end of discrimination based on ethnicity. Then I was at the Chicago police riots 68, and a march on Washington after Kent State. I woke up remembering that that had really happened in my lifetime.\"],[\"I was in Hawaii for a Yoga Festival and my wallet was stolen while I was in the communal shower. The Tax Lady (Ex-Friend & Ex-Mentor, Candace) was there to help, but I did not feel safe. . .Maybe because she betrayed me and my husband??\"],[\"I was in my apartment and it was the beginning of the day. I had just tried to ride my bike to work in the dark and had to turn around (something I don\\u2019t do in real life). It was still dark in the morning. I thought maybe my dog peed because it smelled like urine in the kitchen and I saw bees in a puddle on the floor. I wanted to get them out of here, so I got a swiffer and a paper towel and thought I killed them (I normally don\\u2019t kill bugs; I catch and release). When I turned around they were flying and on my window but they were monarch butterflies. They said they wanted to negotiate something and had reached out to the New York Times. We weren\\u2019t talking but communicating. It was amazing. I opened the balcony door and said to go and come back later when my lights were on. One of them said they would do some self care and then come over. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was in my childhood home. We were going to have a party there, a homecoming. I had to sort through tons of things that I left behind that were in huge piles. The inside of the house had completely rotted, like it had been abandoned and was left in ruins but with stuff everywhere. The lights didn\\u2019t work. Plants were growing through the floorboards. Spider webs everywhere. A spider landed on my face and I couldn't get it off like it was Velcro. It was huge, like a tarantula. My sister tried to get it off but couldn\\u2019t. I clawed at it on my forehead and pulled off a leg but it still wouldn\\u2019t budge. Finally it crawled to the top of my head and my sister pulled it out and threw it. Then we started sorting through the piles and ended up in a grappling fight over some sewing needles and thread that we both claimed were ours. After we fought we had to continue cleaning the place. People came over, aunts and uncles I haven\\u2019t seen for a decade, cousins, friends. And there was a woman named Mim. She was young and Chinese. She was taking care of me. She kept telling me that she was inspired by me for getting out of town and making a new life for myself. It\\u2019s what she wanted to do also and didn\\u2019t know how.\"],[\"I was in some kind of basement sorting through big broken picture frames and there was glass all over the floor. There were black trash bags and my arms were full. Someone called me on a phone and I pulled it out, it was an old phone like the flip razor phones. Who was it? I can\\u2019t remember now but it might have been my mom who has passed. I remember feeling sad. There was blood on the ground but I didn\\u2019t stop what I was doing. I just kept trying to work to meet the deadline or something. Then I realized it was 3:30 and I had missed the appointment for the spa (from earlier dream) and I was mad at myself and about to call the woman and explain that I lost track of time somehow but I couldn\\u2019t explain where I was. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was in the dark and my older sister was there as well as my ex. She left her husband around the same time I left my ex and there were many similarities both between her and him (she used anger as an outlet on me growing up and the primary reason I left was his explosive anger). I\\u2019m close with her now and her husband had explosive anger towards her...I am more avoidant of it. I freeze. In any case, in the dream there was a tree growing into a house porch and it was dark outside. I don\\u2019t remember what happened except we were looking for someone and I felt panicked.\"],[\"I was in the Harry Potter series as a character replacement to Hermione, I had the same thoughts and personality as her only I turned into a death eater.\"],[\"I was in the house and it wasn\\u2019t day or night; it was a greenish kind of gray. My first love boyfriend from high school William was there. I forgot that sometimes I dream about him but it\\u2019s been awhile. He was silent most of the time. I showed up with a group of people - a woman and an older woman who was like her mother or grandmother of Asian descent and then another younger woman. I can\\u2019t remember if I know her in real life. I really had to use the bathroom and there was this joke that every time I had to use the bathroom the older woman would cut me off but I didn\\u2019t have to use the bathroom when I woke up in real life I went back to sleep and I continued to dream. I dreamed I walked into a bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I was wearing three sports bras. It looks like they were on backwards almost but I checked and they weren\\u2019t, they were just really high on my chest and I want to try to use the toilet but it was a strange strange toilet and looks like a tub filled with water and I didn\\u2019t want to pee in that and so I thought maybe I should wait. Then William came in and I asked him and he said that I could use the toilet in the other room. He pulled back a door and there was an old-school old-fashioned regular toilet and I realized I was in a future, but I was also in the past. We planned to hook up later. We went to into the water together. It was like a soaking tub and so nice.\"],[\"I was in the most beautiful store/bazaar searching for sound healing instruments. There were so many rooms and staircases and shelves and items everywhere, imbued with magic. It was never ending. I picked up this beautiful branch with many smaller branches on it and tons of like seed pods attached, filled with seeds. So when I shook it gently, it sounded like rain. It was like a thousand tiny rattles.\"],[\"I was in these underwater Jacuzzi areas and I was chatting with the security guard Arshis and one or two other men. It was almost like I was holding my breath underwater and it was some kind of contest and we were in some kind of maze under the sea. There were these elaborate rooms and rings of hallways but it was all open to the sea at the same time, it\\u2019s hard to explain... and I was able to move through each of these areas very skillfully. The water was really warm (like hot tub warm) and there was some kind of light from a fire source somewhere at the bottom of the ocean.\"],[\"I was interviewing for a job and I had boils all over my face. I had to borrow somebody\\u2019s old beat up car and I had to return it after the job interview but I had to get to a race and then to my moms and I wasn\\u2019t sure how I was going to get anywhere.\"],[\"I was interviewing someone, I was talking to friends about black history.\"],[\"I was living on the second floor of the duplex building, a cluster of duplexes somewhere where it was really bright outside and really flat but I\\u2019ve never been there before. I have a feeling like I was hiding away and I remember hearing noise coming from my apartment. I open the door and then it was silent. The next part of my dream I was already in the car with a bunch of young boys but I was also younger. I\\u2019m actually not sure it was me this time but I was wearing cut off jeans and hiding something in my back pocket that I didn\\u2019t want them to see so I asked if I could use a restroom and they pulled over to a gas station then I got out of the car and remember looking at a pile of rubble wondering if I should do something about it before I went inside. Next, I went in and there were these old men leering at me. I tried to avoid eye contact with them and found my way to a bathroom. Then I woke up. When I woke up I thought I smelled the distinct smell of red wine-but I have not had red wine in my room or anywhere near my apartment. [nap dream]\"],[\"I was me I think and I was with a group of other people I\\u2019ve never met. We were at a store of some kind, maybe a children\\u2019s store and people were not wearing masks. Something happened: one of the men was bad and he got injured. He tried to take me and run away but I ran with another woman and I didn\\u2019t quite trust her either. We were suddenly driving at night on the streets where I grew up (kinda) and all the kids were camped out in tents on the football and soccer fields at night and only some of them were wearing masks.\"],[\"I was missing a mask and terrified of being near people. But people kept getting close and everyone was marching and everyone was happy and I was trying to act happy too and not let on how scared I was.\"],[\"I was moving out of a room or suite from my best friend Aidan\\u2019s house and she was helping me move. We have packed up all the boxes and are making sure we have everything. There are all these clear containers. Then I was getting dressed and she was carrying everything down faster than I could. When we walked out her mom was lounging around outside and there were all these stairs, lots and lots of stairs. I said a joke about how she was a Sherpa and it was really funny. Then Aidan and I went out somewhere and it was during the pandemic but we were in high school like we were when we were best friends and yet we were both wearing our work clothes for some reason and my badge had University Health care. It was hard to see and it said 9 to 5 and we went into this police station or Fireman's gym and they really go \\u201c95\\u201d like it was the call number for a place that they knew. I was embarrassed to tell them it was a particular university, but 925 meant something in the dream.\"],[\"I was not me. I think I was a younger person, maybe this younger girl I\\u2019ve been before in some dreams - she might have been black (I ran with an older woman through a field or something in that other dream). This felt like her but a different time period. I was posting signs on a telephone pole but not with a stapler - with tape - and they wouldn\\u2019t stick so I had to use a lot of tape and the edges kept peeling away. The wood on the pole was thick and smokey and charred like a fresh new pole but also alive somehow. I was communicating with someone about something but I started to wake up. The colors in the dream - it was dark like night and shades of purple and blue but I remember looking up at the stars and they were bright. I wanted to go back but I woke up sweating again and had to pee.\"],[\"I was on a cruise or some kind of family summer camp and had played a few rounds of an interactive scavenger hunt - I think something active maybe paintball and I sat down at a table with a family that I know and then there was a family that I didn\\u2019t know. The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn\\u2019t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I\\u2019ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn\\u2019t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn\\u2019t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn\\u2019t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn\\u2019t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.\"],[\"I was on a family vacation with my dad, his partner (my stepmother), and other people who represented my siblings. We were seated at a table in a dark room with candlelight although it was daytime outside (I could see daylight coming in through windows in the far corner of the room). In my dream we were drinking red wine and eating bread, waiting for a meal. We were going to a show afterwards. The feeling was tense. Other people came to sit down and the waiter brought a bottle of ouzo, something I had in Greece but have never seen my dad drink. My dad then distributed amounts to each of us around the table but not to me; he shook the bottle towards me but only drops came out. I felt left out even though I didn\\u2019t want the drink really (I don\\u2019t drink a lot in real life). This dream was sad, tense, and confusing. I was hyper-aware of everyone else\\u2019s emotions and felt I needed to be quiet when it came to speaking up for myself.\"],[\"I was on a plane with a team and the plane got shot down. They thought someone was coming to save us but they were shooting at us and we hit the ground running. I picked up a Pisces picture and others. A craft fair and handkerchiefs. Lying but not lying. These were the same handkerchief as the other thing I got. I didn\\u2019t realize it until I pulled it out. The colors were purple and teal and then a design. Other fragments: my first year; Marathon shoes; Makeup bathroom; Cinnamon rolls and blueberry and bordering ahead for next day; Japan shoes off; New shoes running training alternating and two other people; Turning gas off/on way down the path- neighbors and dogs jumping. It looked like my old house growing up. Cleaning out the bathtub, bad vacuums and trash bags, I think I was moving and I sprayed the cleaner on the walls and it was peach and teal and I cleaned while I showered.\"],[\"I was on a rooftop\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room.

Staff kind of found me locked in the hallway with posters, I was staging a protest the following day. I had a million bags and posters and markers and nothing was organized. I felt really flustered. There was a family of 8 that needed help figuring out how to get jobs and who was old enough to work and I couldn\\u2019t figure out what they should do.\"],[\"I was redecorating my mother\\u2019s room.

We discovered an inaccuracy! It was a big deal- for some reason we were in a ship and there was a lock (waterway) system and somehow this was related to the 1800s. We saw that after the earthquake in the 1800s (which in my dream I think I related to as big as the 1906 in San Francisco) they decided not to fix the underground area because it was all working. We followed the cracks on the floor and then realized there were less cracks on the other side of the room, and somehow this was significant. The imagery was of a big steel ship/boat with dark deep blue paint. Also in part of this dream I was having dinner with my dad by the water\\u2019s edge - by this lock system - and I had just finished eating with my sisters when he came late. I left them to eat together. My sister was going to order a snack. I went to go make myself a big parsley fresh veggie drink somewhere by myself in a hotel room. In my dream I remember thinking, this is a LOT of parsley, but this is really refreshing.\"],[\"I was visiting a friend of mine that was black and all of the other people that were visiting were also black.

My younger sister Sarah was there and I was going to give her a cabbage patch one because she wouldn\\u2019t have had that in her age group growing up younger, but I got chastised for it. Not sure by who. It was dark. So many desserts. I went to get something out of my bag and my cash was soaking wet because something spilled on it and Aidan said I could pay her for my kids and I was like, \\u201cmy kids?\\u201d I guess she had been watching my kids in the dream all weekend while I did this other thing.

I was watching the long green submarines dive down and then I couldn\\u2019t see the people but could hear their tour. It was like we were on a government sponsored tour. Then I was on a boat and there was a black guy driving and suddenly I was alone. He went to go do something and I turned down the radio to hear nature because Sisqo was on, and then a slow jam that sounded familiar and then I was picking out gold earrings. They were huge circles with scenes of people walking paths in nature but none of them matched.

I would look up and call out to people to watch out. I saw things coming my way and was able to deflect them and people were like, \\u201cHow did you do that? That was amazing!\\u201d and I was like, \\u201cI just looked!\\u201d There were these big long boards that would break in half and hit people.

Some workers outside are wearing masks and some not. We drove by an outdoor jewelry store (all stores have moved outside) and I thought I saw people taking things and commented that if I was security I would have to be careful not to assume everyone was guilty. Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He\\u2019s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said \\u201cI knew you would pull that card!\\u201d And I started to read it but couldn\\u2019t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said \\u201clove.\\u201d He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate.

We\\u2019re celebrating someone or something, I\\u2019m not entirely sure. Julie is like, \\u201cHey are you guys coming to my wedding in a day or so?\\u201d Everyone is like, \\u201cSure!\\u201d But then we look it up and it\\u2019s an eight hour drive to her wedding place at her home in a different state. Google maps pops up and I\\u2019m looking at the route I would have to take. Everybody else is like, \\u201cNope, naw, not going to make it.\\u201d But for some reason I feel obligated to go and don\\u2019t understand why. I\\u2019m going. I have no memory of the time in between or the drive, but suddenly I\\u2019m just there at the wedding. It\\u2019s on her property and it\\u2019s very pretty with English style gardens. It\\u2019s a large property and the house is quaint though large. She\\u2019s with mostly family. I\\u2019m watching the ceremony. Then I see Shawna, she did make it to the wedding. She and I are sitting on the toilets. She has a baby in her arms, I think it\\u2019s hers. She finishes and then I finish. I get up and look and am like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s a big shit and I peed. Well done, Rose. Way to eliminate everything you just eliminated.\\u201d We go back out to the wedding. There are people on a dance floor, but there aren\\u2019t many of us from the party there. We\\u2019re all hanging out. The whole time I\\u2019m wondering why I\\u2019m here. I was invited but I don\\u2019t understand why I said yes to drive eight hours because none of these people are good friends.\"],[\"I was with my dad in a restaurant. The restaurant is gloomy looking. There are plush booth-like seats. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there or what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m just in that space with him. Then he gets up and leaves. I have his briefcase. I don\\u2019t want to be here. I carry his briefcase and go outside. It is bright daylight. It reminds me of being in a casino where they keep the lights dark so you don\\u2019t know what time it is, so the contrast is weird when I walk outside. I walk down this dirt road. There are fields on either side and barbed wire fences. I think I\\u2019m barefoot and I still have his briefcase. I keep walking. I am going past these houses and notice that some of them are old and falling apart - they are the original houses of the neighborhood. And then there are some new gigantic behemoth houses. The new houses are just huge - all I can see is rooftop after rooftop and I can\\u2019t even see the backend of these houses. Then I get past these houses and there are two separate little farms. The houses are older. It\\u2019s clearly a one-person show. Fruits and vegetables are planted and there are flowers. There\\u2019s also hay for mulching. I\\u2019m walking down the lane, then actually walk through the garden because it\\u2019s so inviting. Then I cross over this boundary - a space of land in between these two farms or houses with gardens - to go to the other little farm. Then I realize the ground underneath me is all hot coals, but my feet are not burning. I\\u2019m wanting to cross and get around, but suddenly I\\u2019m in a labyrinth and I can\\u2019t get out of it. The two owners of the house come out - two older white women. They are trying to help me get out of this little inbetween land that is basically all hot coals. It\\u2019s burning their feet, but not mine. They say, \\u201cWell, you can go that way, but you\\u2019re going to burn yourself.\\u201d But I\\u2019m not getting burned. I don\\u2019t go the way I think I\\u2019m going to go because they say I\\u2019m going to burn myself, but it\\u2019s not hot. At one point I do get out and wave goodbye to these women. As I\\u2019m walking down the lane, these dark hedges appear on either side, maybe to my shoulder height. I still have my dad\\u2019s black briefcase in my hand. Now I think I\\u2019m lost. So I pull an old-fashioned walkie-talkie out of the briefcase and press the button and am like, \\u201cHey dad, can you come pick me up?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cHow are you even contacting me?\\u201d I say, \\u201cI have your briefcase and it has this little walkie-talkie in it. Do you remember? It\\u2019s one of the original cell phones we used to have.\\u201d He says, \\u201cI thought I got rid of that a long time ago. How do you have it? How does it even work?\\u201d I keep saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, but can you come get me?\\u201d He\\u2019s fixating on this thing. He doesn\\u2019t ever come get me. I end up in this house with a friend of mine. I don\\u2019t know her in real life. In the dream, she\\u2019s a kind, effervescent, bubbly, very innocent woman with dark hair. She\\u2019s very round with pale skin. Round cheeks, ample breasts, round butt. She and I are walking together. We\\u2019ve walked across a yard into a house. The guy who is there asks, \\u201cCan I help you?\\u201d because we just show up. She starts to make herself super comfy - gets water and starts to cook. The mother and father who own this house show up and they\\u2019re watching her move around. We\\u2019re all having small talk. It\\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that this woman is the perfect partner for the man in this house - the son of the couple that\\u2019s there. Everything she does, you see his eyes getting bigger and bigger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh my god, she does it like how I do it!\\u201d and \\u201cOh my gosh, I never could figure out how to make bread rise and now she can make the bread rise!\\u201d She\\u2019s not showing off, and she\\u2019s very silly about it. He\\u2019s just suddenly smitten. The parents have this grin on their faces and are laughing and like, \\u201cOh yes! Our son\\u2019s finally going to be married off!\\u201d They come together and you can see this is a little match made in heaven. We go back outside. Then the dream skips a bit and I don\\u2019t have the briefcase or walkie-talkie anymore. We are walking down a lane, but now all the houses are on my left, whereas before they were all on my right. There\\u2019s a big rolling hill - like the hills in Hawaii, covered in green grass. I can see up a ways that there is an outdoor patio with an outdoor fire pit like you\\u2019d see at a ski lodge. It\\u2019s the wedding because a bunch of people have gathered. I don\\u2019t recognize anyone except this couple who used to be my old neighbors in the condo I live in now, Rebecca and Oliver. Rebecca was pregnant while they lived here and now she\\u2019s pregnant again. I see them walking up the hill, but they have 7 or maybe 8 children. She\\u2019s carrying an infant and she\\u2019s very far along with another one. Maybe 9 kids all together. I\\u2019m gobsmacked because that\\u2019s so many kids and they\\u2019re all young - all under 5. Part of me doesn\\u2019t know how that\\u2019s possible. I just look at them and are like, \\u201cAre you guys done having kids?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cNo, we love children.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well, if you\\u2019ve got the resources!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at Rebecca and she looks a little haggard, but Oliver is right there with her helping with all the young kids. The dream ends with me wondering why they have so many kids.\"],[\"I was with my dog Pinto at a dog wash and it was strange I was on his level like another dog or his point of view at times. We weren\\u2019t talking with words, just emoting feelings. We were very connected and then we were leaving and I was me again and put him in a bright yellow rain slicker and walked him out. He was prancing and happy and proud. There was a man who I think has been in other dreams, he is kind with brown eyes and he is black and I think from Africa. He reminds me of my friend\\u2019s husband but it\\u2019s not him, just similar appearance and kind energy. I know he\\u2019s been in my dreams before and we aren\\u2019t talking but there\\u2019s an emotional transmission of some kind between his spirit, mine, and my dog.\"],[\"I was with my ex-boyfriend Rory and we were moving in somewhere together and I wasn\\u2019t happy about it. We were getting back together and I was unsure but moving forward. We were trying to buy some things from CostPlus World Market and use coupons. I think it was Redwood City, but it was the future and looked very different. There were all these tall buildings and maybe it was Mountain View. We were planning the shopping trip around a protest that was planned on Friday night. It seemed to be the future and it seemed to be that it was just a part of the regular routine that we were protesting sporadically but it was integrated into our lifestyle.\"],[\"I was with my family and some extended family on my dad\\u2019s side. It was dark and we were going to a big football game. I was nervous about it and I wasn\\u2019t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn\\u2019t like him. I knew that it wasn\\u2019t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design. Everybody was commenting on how fast it was for the game but I was really nervous about going somewhere in public.\"],[\"I was with my friend Emily and she was pouring champagne into glasses and she had some pre-poured in her cupboard! However she drank first and then gave me one but it was a large round cup. I was disappointed it wasn\\u2019t a champagne flute but didn\\u2019t say anything. She said I could stay and watch a movie if I was lonely. I explained that I tried reaching my sisters but that they were busy. In my dream I saw an image of my sister Anne and her family dressed up like fancy Santa and elves and they were doing a family photo shoot and kind of snobbish. Then I went back to my other dream.\"],[\"I was with my friend Heidi (who recently had a baby) at some kind of gym. She was still pregnant and after a workout/class I was putting all of my hand weights away and I had this rolling cart that was probably 5-6 tiers, we all did. Things kept falling off and everything was some shade of purple. She held up a lilac bathing suit and asked whose it was and I was like, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s mine!\\u201d I looked down and I was wearing a black one just like it and it was a size medium, too, so it was mine! We started to chit chat but she had to go. Others were also packing up and we got on a small boat. We were on some kind of island. Later in the dream she was having a baby and I was there and she needed to breathe in to speak and to sing and fill up with breath, but they didn\\u2019t really give us instructions, so we\\u2019re both working on it together. She was only exhaling and I was telling her, \\u201cyou have to inhale to exhale, otherwise you are going to run out of breath and hyperventilate and pass out.\\u201d This is funny because in real life I know it was my yoga teacher training teacher who knows a lot about breathwork and there\\u2019s a lot more than me in all of these types of subjects. In my dream she was really anxious. I think her mom was there in the dream to but I can\\u2019t remember now and then I woke up\"],[\"I was with my friends Emily and Tyler. We were free climbing a rock/ledge that dropped to water. Above are ancient large sculptures carved into the rock of women praying to Mother Earth. There was a whole group of people climbing up and escaping, and people were falling. It was tense and scary, but also beautiful. It wasn\\u2019t day or night.\"],[\"I was with my late husband\\u2019s best friend's wife, Candace. She invited her younger teenage sister over who was wearing a yellow bikini top and tiny black shorts with a robe. There were older guys at the house leering at her and I felt like this could be very inappropriate. In real life I\\u2019ve never met her sister but doubt this would happen. I told her to maybe throw some clothes on and they called me a prude and insecure. I was angry about it when I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my older sister and we were in a huge house, sharing with other other people, mostly women and some kids and it kept flooding! The first time it flooded I didn\\u2019t want her to know so I cleaned it up and realized it was all over even the higher floors. It was dark in the house, too. The second time it flooded she was just out of the shower and I told her it was flooding and she panicked and told me to flip the switches and I couldn\\u2019t find them but I went around spraying the spray she told me to use. It was dark and there were a lot of staircases and rooms and children\\u2019s play stuff but the whole house was empty. There was one staircase without a railing and it went up to a room and I didn\\u2019t want to go up there and then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with my sister and her soon to be ex husband and we went to watch a parade but we had to stay in a big van and keep changing spots. My cousins were there, actually a lot of my dad\\u2019s side of the family was there. My finger was on the ground. There were cigarette butts on the ground. My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom\\u2019s favorite (she\\u2019s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is \\u201cI\\u2019ll fly away.\\u201d Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene. We were in the ruins of something and I thought we were uptown or in BK but then I realized we were closer to 90th street. I used to live on 89th in real life. I was back on the ground somewhere picking up trash and frantically trying to clean up this backyard dirt area where there were cereal boxes and cigarettes, and shove them into black trash bags. I felt panicked.\"],[\"I was with my sisters and my mom or a woman who represented my mom (who passed away when I was 20). We were like a group of Thelma and Louise type characters running from town to town and we were getting chased by police, there was even a water chase scene on jet skis. Then I woke up.\"],[\"I was with somebody like a female friend, but I don\\u2019t really remember who. We were walking from somewhere together and there were all these steep hills one after the other. All of a sudden it was snowing and icy and we were really careful going down these really steep hills and talking about how they would gather speed. Then these people came up behind us and they\\u2019re kind of like these hicks. We overheard them saying things like, \\u201ccan you walk Jonas? Look at us.\\u201d I stopped to get these dollar deals on the side of the road and they had these weird covers and I was looking for them everywhere but they only had one pair. There was something that I had to talk to this other friend about before; it was weird. The roadside stand had all kinds of old travel gadgets.\"],[\"I was working in a house for someone. It wasn\\u2019t dark outside but it wasn\\u2019t light either- a place I\\u2019ve never been in real life but in my dream I\\u2019ve been there before. It was old fashioned; it looked Victorian style - lots of lace and a huge heavy dining room table with claw feet. I was hurrying to clean up before the owners came home. There were at least two dogs with me, one small/medium sized and golden brownish and one larger and brown. I think they belonged to the owners of the house but I took care of them. I think a big wave came at the end of the dream with water rushing everywhere and then I woke up (or thought I did) and I thought my Apple Watch was calling someone but when I checked later it wasn\\u2019t. It seemed like it really happened. I thought I heard, \\u201chello, hello\\u201d in a deep female or lighter male voice. I double checked my iPhone and my Apple Watch which I was wearing to monitor my heart rate. I wasn\\u2019t scared but confused.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me, I was somebody else and I was driving to this facility. There was this woman, an astrophysicist, running OT groups and there was this man in the group (I have never seen him before), middle aged longer curly hair, definitely not my type but I leaned into him at one point and he was wearing a sweater and he smelled good. I went to his room and he wasn\\u2019t there overnight so I laid in his bed and then I got up the next morning and I was hiding from everybody. I decided I wanted to drive home, but driving through the desert wasn\\u2019t possible, and I only had one day left there. I went to see the group and they were eating cheesy hashbrowns for breakfast. I finally showed myself but it was embarrassing and really out of character.\"],[\"I wasn\\u2019t me. I was a woman with a family and we had a garden and land and a greenhouse and neighbors. I had a little boy. It was green gray outside. We were watering the garden and there was a sonic BOOM and all of a sudden we could not water or share with our neighbors over the fence. It had stopped the water from being shared. Another part of the dream: Hooded people came. They were shooting at unarmed people in the neighborhood who were just gardening- boom boom! It looked like they were holding hoses but they were guns.\"],[\"I watch as a couple of guys deal with things\\u2026.One guy puts his arms out like he is going to fly\\u2026.he has to wait like this for a bigger process to happen\\u2026.I feel a little sorry for him, just standing like that, waiting\\u2026.A small black plastic tube is part of it\\u2026.And a woman is with them\\u2026.they do not treat her well\\u2026.She sits quietly and waits\\u2026.\"],[\"I watch as a couple of worker guys in a truck finish their task, then drive away\\u2026.I said goodbye to them, but as they drive I see one of them looking for me to wave, but he cannot see me, and they are gone\\u2026.They were here starting their job very early\\u2026.As I go out through a building, I see some of their people taking a nap in a dark, comfortable room\\u2026.Like airline pilots between flights?....I go as quietly as I can through the door, I want to let them get their rest\\u2026.Then, I am sitting with two other people, a man and a woman, and I see three other people sitting together on a property above ours\\u2026.Hmm, that feels like it diminishes our privacy\\u2026.I am in black socks and black sweatpants, which I realize is not a very stylish look outside\\u2026.Still, I am leaning back in my chair, rocking comfortably, pleasantly\\u2026.\"],[\"I watch people holding the hand of a dying one\"],[\"I watched some scary movies like the conjuring and had dreams the same night about the house in the movie. Had dreams about being a Jedi after watching The Clone Wars on Disney Plus.\"],[\"I went swimming in a little pond lake with my friend Sarah and her baby Amy. Amy swam around the Little Rock island in the middle of the pond and I was nervous that she went by herself since she wasn\\u2019t even 2. We got out when the owner of the pond came out and was talking about super boring shit. We ate some lunch and I went to prep for the party. My hair dried cute but I smelled horrible so I took a shower and the water was black running off my body. Aida came over and found a recipe on a piece of paper that fell out of a book. It was for love. She borrowed a bunch of things and went off to make food for someone. I was on the phone with John and talking about a recipe. I opened my bedroom door and there was another door right after it. And then another! And another lol. I was like \\u201cthere are so many doors here\\u201d and then went down stairs and there was a dinner party going on. And he was at the table and reading off to folks whose turn it was to eat and what food to eat. We each ate one at a time. Then after everyone ate, we were playing music, I had some kind of box-shaped rudimentary cello, John had a guitar but it was also box-shaped like homemade, and another person had a box drum.\"],[\"I witnessed an event where a police officer killed a Black person. I was yelling to try and get people\\u2019s attention but no one said or did anything. It was like I wasn\\u2019t there.\"],[\"I woke up from a dream that my husband and I both had the virus and was in the hospital on oxygen and I got a phone call from my ex husband stating my two children had it too and they were dying from it.\"],[\"I woke up in another dream where I was recovering at a house but the house was for sale, so I had to make it presentable. I\\u2019m trying to remember the details on this but I was also watching the interactions between a couple. There was a man and a woman who were together and he was trying to make friends with all of the single women at the party and make plans to see them and his wife was like, \\u201cdude take a break!\\u201d\"],[\"I woke up scared. I was sitting in the systems lobby of the UTP and I was wearing an orange sweater and a little skirt, on one side were CAb and QJo and TAv arrived with whom I was flirting, so I returned home at mid-afternoon and went to sleep, my home was very different from my real home. I was already asleep when my sister GEi started to put something in my mouth and since I was watching a video, she kind of tried to hide the cell phone and then my Mom came saying that one of us had taken drugs, like GEi was trying to put me a pill She said she was going to hit us and I said no and no and no, and she was going to give us a test and there the dream ended.\"],[\"I woke up with such a high fever I could hardly move in my dream. I woke up all wrapped in my blanket!!\"],[\"I wrote a short story all about it\"],[\"I'm fighting in a Civil War. It's Black vs White. Many people on both sides dead. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist supported group. In this dream I am extremely angry that so many Black people are deceived. In the dream I repeatedly say how tragic it is that people on both sides who exercise their constitutional right to peacefully protest are used by evil forces.The fighting is so intense. This isn't my first war either. I feel such anger! then the media /reporters appear I'm shooting them. I am shooting a lot of people...My rifle is out of ammunition and then I wake up. I'm sweating and feel like I've been through a war.\"],[\"I'm often a minor in my dreams, around 16-17 years old, and worried about my parents' opinions and/rules throughout the dream.

I was frantically trying to get in touch with coworkers via email to see if someone could cover, without much luck. The dream isn't specifically about this situation, but these types of anxiety dreams only seem to crop up when something is really bothering me.\"],[\"I've had multiple celebrities in my dreams.\"],[\"I've had several dreams about forgetting about COVID-19 and accidentally going to a crowded place, touching people, or not wearing a mask. Then I remember and panic and I worry about infecting my housemate. In one of these dreams I was at a concert. In another one I was with a group of friends who all kept taking their masks off.\"],[\"I've have dreamed that I was in the movie Inception.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a black sand beach. There are parts where the sand is fine and other parts where the rocks are bigger - maybe fist size. The bigger rocks are white and black mixed together. It\\u2019s steep where the beach goes down into the water. I\\u2019m in a truck with a camper on the top. I\\u2019ve driven the truck to the edge where the beach heads down to the water. There are a bunch of high school classmates and people from other high schools that I grew up with - mostly guys, but a couple girls. I\\u2019m watching them surf and I\\u2019ve got my boogie board to head out to surf with them. I\\u2019m a little freaked out because the waves are big. I go out anyway and catch a few waves. The part that is causing me the most anxiety is that I\\u2019ve parked the truck right on the edge where the beach starts to head down. I need to move the truck and I\\u2019m afraid if I pull it up or back a little bit, it will start sliding down into the water. So, I get in the truck because we are all done surfing and heading to a party. I\\u2019m asking for help. I don\\u2019t want to be the one to try and drive it because I\\u2019m afraid the wheels are going to spin and I\\u2019ll slide down into the water. Then I think I do get the truck out and manage to pull it forward but not without a lot of fear and some help. The scene changes and there\\u2019s a party going on. I don't remember much about the party, except that it\\u2019s all the same people that were there at the beach with me. I feel kind of like the uninvited guest, although I was invited. My own personal feeling about it is that I don\\u2019t really belong there. It\\u2019s a typical high school party with all of us smoking, drinking and dancing. I hated those. There\\u2019s a shift in the dream. I\\u2019m with this super tall dark handsome man - I don\\u2019t know who he is. There\\u2019s a professor and a bunch of other people. Now it feels like a college classroom, but it\\u2019s not an actual classroom. We\\u2019re in a building, and the professor is up in front of me. There is a string of lights - they don\\u2019t look like Christmas lights, the bulbs are much bigger. The professor is showing us the secrets of the universe and how light works and how we harness light and how the vibration slows down into matter. He\\u2019s showing us a very particular property of these lightbulbs that are also plants. This is where it gets a little bit weird. There\\u2019s a string or vine in the corner of the room that is also really open and not exactly inside. There\\u2019s a download of a lot of stuff my brain isn\\u2019t capable of fathoming. In the meantime, the professor is asking for different inanimate objects to illustrate his point. So, there\\u2019s a bed that a bunch of us are laying on or near as we are getting this lesson from the male professor. The tall dark handsome man is lying next to me. He is married - this comes up somewhere in the conversation. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, I guess he\\u2019s off limits now.\\u201d But he is flirting with me like crazy. He asks for a strand of my hair to give the professor so the professor can show us whatever he\\u2019s going to show us. It was a flirty move for the guy to grab a strand of my hair and this flirtation is happening, even though he made sure to tell me he was married. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really care about that if you don\\u2019t care and your partner\\u2019s alright with it.\\u201d But I don\\u2019t know where this is going and it\\u2019s interesting that we\\u2019re lying on a bed. Then the scene shifts again. I\\u2019m in a gym. There are pull up bars - like the rack in a CrossFit gym. There\\u2019s a coach. We\\u2019re doing an endurance test of how strong we all are and how long we can do pull ups with correct form - our form has to be super solid. He\\u2019s giving us a really specific circuit - five strict pull ups, five butterfly pull ups, then a hang in the pull up position to hold for five seconds - and do as many sets of that as possible. I\\u2019m getting really frustrated with the bars they have because there\\u2019s not enough room to do the butterfly pull ups. I keep trying but keep hitting my back on the rig behind me. I\\u2019m finding this entire exercise incredibly frustrating. We\\u2019re trying to get through ten sets of this 5 + 5 + 5. I keep moving to different places on the rig to find a place where I can do the butterfly pull ups correctly. In the meantime, I\\u2019m watching all these dudes whip out all these reps. I\\u2019m so annoyed and thinking, \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s just because men are naturally stronger than women in the upper body and I haven\\u2019t had a chance to workout or train at all and I\\u2019m doing this from a disadvantaged place.\\u201d The whole feel of this is really frustrating. Then the scene changes again. I\\u2019m with classmates at a dance party. We\\u2019re dancing on one of the many lawns of our high school - there are lots of open fields where we played sports or parked cars or hung out. It\\u2019s freestyle dancing and we\\u2019re having a good time dancing together. There\\u2019s a DJ. One of the girls - I don\\u2019t really recognize her in the dream - is dancing, but I can tell she\\u2019s not super comfortable. So there\\u2019s some sort of interlude. She comes back and we\\u2019re all dancing again. This time she has 8 backup dancers and she\\u2019s clearly choreographed and rehearsed a dance to do. All of us are like, \\u201cWhat are you doing? This is a dance for fun. You don\\u2019t need backup dancers to make you look better.\\u201d We\\u2019re laughing at her. She\\u2019s clearly put a lot of work into this dance. The backup dancers are all very serious with what they\\u2019re doing. All of us are like, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve missed the point. The point is just to let your body move and dance and have fun.\\u201d It seems very odd in the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a conference. I look across the way and see a yoga studio. The studio is struggling to keep its doors open. I see what looks to be an image of Ana Forrest, an international yoga teacher. She\\u2019s doing padangusthasana. As I look, I realize, it\\u2019s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it\\u2019s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it\\u2019s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don\\u2019t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she\\u2019s participating in to raise funds for the school. She\\u2019s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn\\u2019t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a convention. There are multiple themes to this convention - things are being demoed and sold, but it\\u2019s also a CrossFit convention because every person is jacked and totally yoked, including the women. I think, \\u201cEh, I used to look like that and I don\\u2019t anymore. I\\u2019m glad I don't.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a judgment against them, though. I\\u2019m just glad I\\u2019m not in the CrossFit mindset. I\\u2019m here with some people - a woman who is a little shorter than me with longer brown hair. Her vibe is the vibe of my ex and I\\u2019m not liking her. She seems to be doing stuff that makes no sense. She buys a charcoal grill that is red, brand new and shiny and clean. I turn to her and say, \\u201cWe actually have a charcoal grill at home that looks exactly like that, but it\\u2019s black. Why are you buying a new one?\\u201d She\\u2019s not computing that we don\\u2019t need another one. She\\u2019s just in it for the thrill of buying, I think. I just don\\u2019t understand why she can\\u2019t understand that we don\\u2019t need another one. Then, the other person I\\u2019m with is a man. He\\u2019s buying a truck - a huge black truck. Part of me is like, \\u201cCan you even afford that truck? I think you actually owe me money, so how are you paying for that truck?\\u201d At one point we try these demo treadmills. An instructor is walking people through a HIT workout - high intensity training. There are a bunch of CrossFitters. He says, \\u201cEveryone has to keep their treadmill at six.\\u201d I\\u2019m struggling to keep it at six and last for 15 or 30 seconds. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t for me.\\u201d This is not my norm - normally I would just push until I won. I just didn\\u2019t. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, you all go ahead do this. I\\u2019m not interested.\\u201c I get off the treadmill. Then I wonder where my kids are. This couple I was with reminds me of my ex and maybe his girlfriend. I\\u2019m really concerned. He was supposed to be watching them and says, \\u201cWell, they\\u2019re off with friends.\\u201d I have no idea who my daughter is with and I never see her in the dream, but I have this worry for her because I don't know where she is. Then I go looking for my son and wander out of the convention center. There\\u2019s a pool and a grassy area. I see a bunch of other moms sitting in folding chairs. I\\u2019m asking if they\\u2019ve seen my son. One says, \\u201cOh yea, he\\u2019s with my kid.\\u201d These moms have their sons and they\\u2019re with this other mom who pulls up in this huge black suburban. My son is in the backseat with a bunch of other boys. The mom is in the front. I say, \\u201cHi, who are you? I don\\u2019t know you at all.\\u201d She introduces herself and says that they\\u2019ve had my son at their house before. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking them all to the waterpark or the trampoline place.\\u201d Part of me is like, \\u201cWhy are you trusting this person you\\u2019ve never met? There\\u2019s a gaggle of boys in the back with two coughing because they\\u2019re so sick.\\u201d My son is like, \\u201cMom I want to go!\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo way! Get out of that car.\\u201d Then the other part of me is like, \\u201cWell, I guess I have her phone number and I can trust her. All the other moms trust her with their kids. She seems legit, okay let him go.\\u201d I close the door and let them drive off and then am like, \\u201cOh god, I shouldn\\u2019t have let him go.\\u201d There\\u2019s a sinking feeling in my chest that does not feel good. I\\u2019m really concerned. I turn around and walk back towards the moms. They\\u2019re trying to tell me that it\\u2019s going to be fine. I\\u2019m just not having it. I\\u2019m starting to panic like, bring me back my son and where is my daughter. I\\u2019m wondering why my ex is letting them go with people he doesn\\u2019t even know. I am feeling upset by the whole thing. I\\u2019m really wanting the kids to come back and to know where they are.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a crowded dinner party. We haven\\u2019t sat down to eat yet. We\\u2019re all going in and out of the kitchen putting together a bunch of different salads and setting the table. They\\u2019re mostly young adults in their twenties, just out of college it seems. I get a phone call from a landline. It\\u2019s Ted. I can hardly hear him because of all the activity in the kitchen and people with their pots and pans and multiple conversations. I can hear the gist of it. He\\u2019s having a hard time. I suggest he come in for some care. He makes a comment that is the closest thing to being overt about his attraction to me that I\\u2019ve ever heard. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWill it be okay for you to treat someone who\\u2019s hitting on you?\\u201d I'm thinking about all the rules and regulations and if this would be okay because I would like to see him. The conversations in the kitchen get louder and someone asks me to set the table so I have to go. There\\u2019s a shift in the dream. There\\u2019s a young couple in a courtyard. Tables are set up for an event. The couple is wandering through. They\\u2019ve met each other here and are wanting to extend the night. They\\u2019re walking around and I\\u2019m watching them. They\\u2019re falling in love as the day and evening go by. Their families arrive and for some reason they\\u2019re not supposed to be together. The families overlook it for now. The dream goes by and they\\u2019re spending more time together. He\\u2019s painting her and writing about her. His family forbids them from seeing each other. But she\\u2019s moved in with him. She\\u2019s packing to go and she shows him where she has stored papers and journals beside his bed. She says, \\u201cIf you miss me and want to know me better, look through these papers.\\u201d There are empty plastic organizing folders and receipt folders filled with receipts from 2007 or 2017. She points out the years and says, \\u201cIf you want to know who I was back then, you can look at these.\\u201d She\\u2019s being transparent about her past. She has to leave and she does. They make an arrangement to meet at a sporting goods store in the future. She walks in and there are people taking a physical therapy exercise class at the back of the store and there are different exercise stations throughout the store. People are trying out the equipment and taking class. She wanders to the back and meets people and thinks she could help them more at her office. But she realizes they only have to pay $5 a class here and they are getting some help here. She sees him and they have to pretend they haven\\u2019t. She wanders to the front of the store where there are two television screens set up showing an exercise dance class. It\\u2019s an interesting setup because one television shows the front of the teacher and the other shows the back of the teacher, so it\\u2019s easier to follow along. He sees her dancing and walks over to sit near her and set up his art exhibit. Then his mom comes in and she\\u2019s dressed primly. She\\u2019s paging through the book the couple had made together - the woman has written the words and he\\u2019s drawn the pictures. A lot of the pictures are of the young woman. The mom is flipping through the book. There are pictures of the mom, too. She\\u2019s pretending to not be impressed but it is truly a fabulous piece of art. She\\u2019s there to lead a group of young girls in a dance performance. The girls are dressed in overcoats and hats with flowers. She\\u2019s so stern. At the end of the performance, instead of congratulating them on their performance, she coldly walks away.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a dinner party of sorts - it feels like one of those social gatherings like an auction where they raise money for a cause. I\\u2019m sitting at a long table and there\\u2019s a Latino man to my left who is paying me quite a lot of attention, but my attention is focused on another group of people who are not sitting at a table - they are standing up and gathered in a crowd and they\\u2019re huddled somewhat closely together. Some of them are dressed as servers who are working this banquet dinner. Some of them are dressed as guests. The sense I\\u2019m getting is that they have something up their sleeve. They\\u2019re planning to do something and there\\u2019s definitely magic involved. I keep seeing little flashes or vignettes of little scenes where something is a little out of place and the thing that\\u2019s out of place has a red color and everything else in the background is its normal color. I\\u2019m not quite understanding everything I\\u2019m seeing, but I know that each of these little vignettes I see, one thing is going to trigger the next thing and it will be a sequence of events that creates this magic. I don\\u2019t even know what it is - it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s supposed to impact the way this auction dinner is going. This is taking up quite a bit of my attention until the Latino man on my left who has dark short cropped black hair, dark skin and a 5 o\\u2019clock shadow where I can see he has shaved but it\\u2019s not smoothe...He\\u2019s a little older than I am and he has leaned over to get my attention. He\\u2019s leaning over my left shoulder and it feels like his upper body is almost in my lap, but he\\u2019s still being very respectful, it\\u2019s not a pushy way, he just really is trying to get my attention. He says that he will protect me and love me no matter what, which I find a little unnerving because I don\\u2019t know who he is. This scene ends and it cuts away to me driving a car. I\\u2019m driving away from the dinner. I think it\\u2019s the next day because it\\u2019s light out and this was definitely a dinner happening in the evening. I\\u2019m driving to an errand of some sort and I can see that it\\u2019s sunny and it looks like I\\u2019m going the regular path I take to drive my kids to tennis. I\\u2019m on the phone with a girlfriend and I\\u2019m relating this story to her and I\\u2019m relating the behavior of this Latino man who, now that it\\u2019s the next day I feel like he was a kind of wizard of some sort or at least he had great magical power or he had the ability to at least take me out of whatever was going on. So I\\u2019m relating this story of my friend and I\\u2019m asking her what she thinks of it. She\\u2019s telling me that yes it was somewhat strange behavior but I could actually trust this man and I remember thinking, well, trust him or not, I don\\u2019t know why he said he was going to love me. There was no chemical attraction there at all. I just felt baffled by his behavior. But I start to feel strange talking about this on the phone the next day and I know that there is some sort of connection happening and it feels like there\\u2019s an alchemical process happening in my body as I describe it to my friend. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a lake cottage with my son. We are standing on the edge of the lake. We see a mama and baby swan, a rodent/marsupial mama and baby, and another mama and baby animal. He points out a small black bat struggling in the water. We are watching it as it splashes. He\\u2019s asking me about it: \\u201cIs that a bird, mama?\\u201d I tell him it\\u2019s a bat. I\\u2019m concerned it could have rabies. Other people and kids come by. They are climbing around the rocks. A woman holds my son and then gives him back to me saying he pooped in his diaper. I\\u2019m surprised because he\\u2019s potty trained. But I do see that her dress is soiled and so is his diaper. I take him away to change even though he wants to stay and play. We return to the cottage. I see Trina, a friend and former boss. She says, \\u201cOh, I need you to run an errand for me. I need you to carry my pet wombat to my other house.\\u201d I take this wombat with me on the trip and it is climbing all over me. It\\u2019s quite cuddly, cute and soft, like a baby. I arrive at her other house and see a lot of people. They are soaking in hot tubs by the lake. There isn\\u2019t a spot for me here. Then Trina\\u2019s husband wants to show me something. It\\u2019s a restaurant or storefront under construction. He wants my opinion about the flooring and decor.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party, it\\u2019s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I\\u2019m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven\\u2019t said anything, but I\\u2019m feeling like, \\u201cUh, I don\\u2019t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn\\u2019t feel super good.\\u201d Fear of judgment and all that. I\\u2019m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we\\u2019re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, \\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll be back.\\u201d I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019ve never seen before, but it's a house that\\u2019s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I\\u2019m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I\\u2019m at her house, which I don\\u2019t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They\\u2019re talking to me about planning how they\\u2019re going to remodel parts of their house and how it\\u2019s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they\\u2019re going to earn it. I\\u2019m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he\\u2019s one of those ages). They\\u2019re showing me how they\\u2019re going to do it. They\\u2019re really, really friendly - it\\u2019s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there\\u2019s different ways. I\\u2019m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, \\u201cWell, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.\\u201d So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It\\u2019s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.\\u201d Then my friend is like, \\u201cWell I need you to come and do this thing with me.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I\\u2019m feeling torn because I don\\u2019t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there\\u2019s all these crappy t-shirts like you\\u2019d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They\\u2019re on one of those round racks and I\\u2019m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re doing all these things, come do this with me.\\u201d A second friend from the party comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGuess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.\\u201d She\\u2019s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that\\u2019s where I worked. It\\u2019s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a party. It\\u2019s at a bar/restaurant with wood picnic tables, floors, walls and ceilings. My husband is in a bad mood and we aren\\u2019t talking. My son is there along with other kids. There\\u2019s a pool in here. I get in the water and am first just hanging out, quite morose. Now everyone is hanging out under the water. Some are drinking, some are talking and some are sitting quietly by themselves. I start propelling myself through the water with my arms. I feel so free and strong and good in my body, propelling myself from side to side, from one end of the pool to the other. I observe people talking and flirting and some high on drugs. I see my husband just lying there on his stomach with a glass of water and a plastic cup of beer. He\\u2019s not wanting to talk to me or look at me. I lie next to him on the bottom of the pool. Neither of us speak and I can tell he\\u2019s still in a mood. After a while I get up. He gets up and adjusts a necklace on a man\\u2019s neck. I wonder what that\\u2019s about. I look around and don\\u2019t see my son. I don\\u2019t see any children. The kids are all together in another room. I look through the door and see Maxine bouncing a blond boy on her knee. At first I think it\\u2019s my son, but he\\u2019s too young and his hair is a bit longer. I look deeper into the room and see my son at the far end sitting at a desk and reading a book on a screen device like an iPad. Maxine says, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019ll be done in a little bit. We only do a few minutes of screen time.\\u201d I\\u2019m not pleased because we don\\u2019t do screen time at all. I also see a plastic magic school bus toy. On the plastic window are words. The second line says, \\u201cA fucking ride.\\u201d The third line says to choose your form of payment: \\u201cboys, another and aloha.\\u201d I\\u2019m peeved that there are different fees for boys and girls. The teacher tries to convince me that it\\u2019s good thing because the kids can choose whatever fee they want and even have the girls pay more.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a reform school for little children. Somehow my son is safe, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s because he\\u2019s too young or too old. My husband and I have rented a massage room upstairs and we\\u2019re trying to get out of the lease because it feels sinister. While I\\u2019m there, the reformers come. They are young men, probably in their twenties. They\\u2019ve been reformed themselves and have grown up in this system. They\\u2019re there to separate out the children and choose the ones who will be reformed. They separate them into red groups and orange groups. I think that it would be best for them to choose the ones who are already complacent and will go along with everything. But I notice that the young men are ones that I recognize from earlier in my life - I saw them at Esalen and they were really carefree spirits. So the children that they are not the complacent quiet well behaved ones, but of course the ones that are the most wild, free and expressive - the ones that have a sense of themselves from the very beginning, kind of like my son... One of those colors will be the group that will be reformed this time around. All of the little ones that will be taken away are on a bus and my husband is on the bus. He wants to take a ride down the hill to the gate. He encourages me and our son to get on the bus, too. I don\\u2019t feel great about it, but I get on the bus. The headmistress steps onto the bus, too. I get a very bad feeling. The bus starts going and I want to get out. I demand that they stop the bus and let me out. I know that I can\\u2019t save the children that have already been chosen but I need to get out for myself and my son. They won\\u2019t stop the bus. So I push my way to the front doors of the bus and push the doors open. I\\u2019m holding my son and I look down at the ground, jump out and tumble to the ground. My son and I are safe. I don\\u2019t know what will happen to my husband, but I have a feeling he\\u2019ll be fine.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at a social gathering with my husband and he\\u2019s really upset with me. He\\u2019s flirting with another woman. She\\u2019s like a Barbie doll - really skinny with bleach blonde hair. She\\u2019s wearing a pink gown, her hair is done just right, her makeup is done just right. She\\u2019s this archetype of a \\u201cperfect\\u201d woman advertised in magazines. He\\u2019s being a gentleman - pulling her chair out, pouring wine into her glass, and being really attentive to all her needs. She\\u2019s responding to him. I\\u2019m aware that she\\u2019s intentionally being mean to me in showing her feelings towards my husband. I get livid. This is not unusual in my dreams. I\\u2019m punching and kicking and making a huge display. Then I have to retire to another room and rest for the night. Everybody has to lie down on floors and go to sleep. Then the next part of the dream, there\\u2019s an assembly of people sitting in chairs like in a college auditorium. There\\u2019s been a rebellion. Every year we base our family celebration (something like Thanksgiving) on multidimensional geometry. But this year, there\\u2019s a rebellion. This big guy who looks like he used to play football but is now heavy from beer and nachos stands up and draws a single dimension triangle with squiggles around it. He says we\\u2019re doing it this way this year. So he makes it really flat and simple. There are grumbles throughout - some people are really upset but can\\u2019t do anything about it, others are more supportive and happy it will be easier for them to understand. I am forced to join this new celebration. Everyone around me is heavy - they drink a lot of beer and eat a lot of processed food - they\\u2019re like your typical American. They\\u2019re making the feast. I am participating in making the feast. They give me a sip of this walnut liquor and I find it unusual that they have a taste for this liquor because it seems quite refined. Then somebody is talking about the walnut flooring they were able to purchase for their new home because somebody else maybe their girlfriend lent them $500 to help with their school, so they had this extra money to put towards the new floors in their home. Then I look out the window and there\\u2019s a spaceship flying by, so we must be really high in the sky. I look in the window of this new spaceship and it has a table with seating for four and a little loveseat. It seems to be an advertisement for this new kind of meeting room/home that flies through the sky. It\\u2019s futuristic.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at an airport. I\\u2019m sitting at a table playing a card or domino game with my grandmother and Ted. There is definitely a strong desire and attraction between Ted and me. We want to find a place and time after the game to be together. My grandmother is watching without judgment. She knows. There\\u2019s absolutely no judgment from her, but for me I feel a combination of comfort with her and a strong charge of desire and comfort in playing with him, especially when our hands occasionally touch. I have a wallet. I need to pay for something - my portion of a rent or dues as part of a big group. I take my wallet out to pay. Somehow my husband now has my wallet and takes care of the payment for me. My grandmother goes on to catch her plane. Ted and I walk together through a crowd, but not wanting to attract any attention because he is well respected in this group as am I - we are both known. Now I\\u2019m looking for a new carry-on suitcase. There are stores all over. I have an argument with my husband about which one to get and it\\u2019s so frustrating. I see a store with some beautiful floral suitcases on the loft. I\\u2019m told that this shopkeeper knows exactly what I need. I consult with her and choose one. I panic when I try to pay and can\\u2019t find my wallet. Ted goes to look for it. Then I remember that my husband has it. He scoffs at me and says the wallet is in the jacket, or at least that\\u2019s where he put it and last saw it. I\\u2019m frustrated because I don\\u2019t trust that he put it in the jacket in a secure way. I\\u2019m also concerned he just left it somewhere. Then I come upon a huge underground room - it\\u2019s like an underground sea with big pillars holding up the roof. It\\u2019s dark. I see wading in the shallow water, a figure like Merlin in a cape and holding a staff. I wade into the water to see him. I\\u2019m still thinking of and desiring Ted. I look up and see people coming across the bridge. They are carrying my coat. They give the coat to me. I feel through it and cannot find my wallet. It\\u2019s the wrong coat and my wallet is not there. I\\u2019m shaking it and feeling all over. People walk into the water then walk out. I\\u2019m not sure if they have my highest interest in mind. They are communicating with the magician. I leave. I do find the correct jacket with the wallet in the pocket.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at my childhood home. It really does look like my childhood home. The backyard is like what I\\u2019m used to seeing. The house is just kind of like I know it, some of the pieces are the same. In the backyard now there is a lanai that goes all the way out and it\\u2019s glassed in with doors that have eight little square window panes. It looks like a greenhouse or sunporch. It also has an English period feel to it. It\\u2019s very bright. The sunroom is painted white. There\\u2019s silver everywhere - silver serving platters and whatnot. We\\u2019re not dressed fancy or anything; we\\u2019re in Hawaii and dressed comfortably. I see a plate of bacon on the porch. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes! Bacon!\\u201d I go to eat it and my mom is like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s from so and so, she brought it over. She\\u2019s trying it out to see if it\\u2019s the kind we like or want.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s interesting and wonder why they would be doing that. I know sometimes bacon is coated in flour and now I\\u2019m wary of trying it because I know I\\u2019m allergic. Then my brothers are showing up and they\\u2019re demolishing the bacon. When I look out at the backyard, I can see the stream and the cliff wall on the far side - I\\u2019ve had this in other dreams before. I\\u2019ve dreamt this landscape in dreams but it doesn\\u2019t actually match what my backyard looks like in real life. I can usually see to the other side of the stream a hill which I could go up and over. But this time is the cliff face on the far side and the water. There\\u2019s some sort of activity happening. There are a bunch of nice lawn chairs like you\\u2019d have for an event. They\\u2019re all set up on the lawn. I am looking through a pair of binoculars. My brothers are sitting in some of the chairs and my binoculars are rating them. My brothers are suddenly younger in age. The binoculars are like, \\u201cThis one is single and he plays sports, he\\u2019s a forward.\\u201d I look at the next one and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis one is too young for consideration.\\u201d Then I look at another one and the binoculars say something rude like, \\u201cNot cute.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow fuck you rude binoculars.\\u201d They don\\u2019t actually say things; they\\u2019re printing words at the bottom of my vision. It\\u2019s so strange and I don\\u2019t know why my brothers are being rated. There are two other guys. I don\\u2019t recognize them, but they\\u2019re youngish and fit within my brothers\\u2019 ages. They have what looks like soccer shin pads that I\\u2019ve made for them. They need them but I don\\u2019t know why. I\\u2019m sewing the shin pads into the box and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing this because they\\u2019re going to need them eventually. I\\u2019m very meticulous, one tiny stitch at a time, sewing them into a cardboard box and plastic frame. All of a sudden I realize they\\u2019re going to need to wear these so why am I doing this because they won\\u2019t be able to get them. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere are your shin pads. You\\u2019ll need them when you need them.\\u201d One of them asks me how to make the shin pads tight on their legs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s velcro, you just tighten it.\\u201d One of them is like, \\u201cNo, you might have to sew them onto me.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cI could sew through your skin but that would be weird.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, that might happen.\\u201d I\\u2019m confused internally. Part of me thinks that makes total sense and I might need to sew them onto their skin and it\\u2019s like a right of passage and that\\u2019s how I know they\\u2019re warriors. But the other part of my brain is like, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t sew skin.\\u201d Then the dream changes a little bit. I decide to go to the pool. I did not grow up with a pool so this is definitely out of my regular childhood home reality. I wade into the pool. It\\u2019s a huge rectangular pool, enclosed with glass windows on one side and some light coming in. There are double doors that look like the same doors on the sunporch. It\\u2019s like a boat ramp that you walk down and it slowly gets deeper and deeper. So I\\u2019m in the pool and at the far end where there is less light and a lot darker, there\\u2019s a room off to the left. Part of the room is underwater. Somebody opens the doors to this room. I\\u2019m starting to panic because I know that they\\u2019re not supposed to open those doors. Sure enough, this creature comes out of those doors. I\\u2019m scared. I don\\u2019t recall what the creature looks like. It\\u2019s coming into the main pool. I have swum out to where I can\\u2019t touch and now I\\u2019m swimming back to where I can get out of the water. I remember tentacles so maybe it was part octopus, but I\\u2019m not sure.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at the beach with Trina and Craig. When I first arrive, they're in the ocean taking surf lessons. It\\u2019s quite rough, choppy water, so not ideal surf conditions. They get back to the shore and talk about their time out in the water. They invite us out into the water with them. They\\u2019ve hired a boat. We go together. They didn\\u2019t set up surf lessons for us, though. The boat is just taking us out through a complex series of docks and things, not open ocean. We\\u2019re going to a floating hotel and through the hotel. A door opens. There\\u2019s a smaller boat with a guy in a wheelchair that goes ahead of our larger boat. He opens the doors for us to pass through. Then we get to open water but it\\u2019s not surfable. They leave us there to find our way back or get settled into a room.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at the bottom of a pool. I feel my belly soft on the undulating seaweed. Then I\\u2019m standing looking up and I can easily breathe with my arms uplifted.\"],[\"I\\u2019m at work at the grocery store. I\\u2019m in the back - the receiving room. There\\u2019s tons of product to put out, but it\\u2019s time to close and go home. So we\\u2019re all working as quick as we can. My coworkers along with the manager I usually close with at night are there. My manager is saying, \\u201cOkay, finish this cart, but leave the rest. It\\u2019s time to get out. We need to be done.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s what she says, so I gather up my stuff and go out. But then she's like, \\u201cOh no, we\\u2019re not leaving out. We have to put all this away.\\u201d There are a bunch of brand new carts out in this open space in the store. They have orange handles and our carts have green handles, so I\\u2019m looking at these orange handles and one of my other coworkers who is also a manager says, \\u201cHey, can you clean that one cart right there?\\u201d It has all this sticky stuff on it - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s honey or maple syrup or what. I\\u2019m looking at it and am like, \\u201cOh my god, this is going to take forever to clean. I just want to go home.\\u201d But they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t go home until this stuff is put away or cleaned up.\\u201d So, I\\u2019m scrubbing this and I\\u2019m pretty cranky about it. I get it clean. Then I realize later that if I had just stuck the cart in the freezer, that stuff would have frozen and I could have just flaked it off. But I get it cleaned and I roll it to the back. Now everybody is ready to go, but they\\u2019re waiting on me because it took me forever to clean that cart. I sit down because I need to change my shoes and take off my apron. They\\u2019re all in the room where we clock out. I\\u2019m still in the break room, trying to hurry. Suddenly, this pole appears in the receiving room in the back. The coworker who told me to clean all the sticky stuff off the cart is like, \\u201cOh, can you show me some pole stuff? I want to see what it looks like.\\u201d So, I get on there and I do some moves. I\\u2019m totally impressed with myself because I didn\\u2019t know I could do all these moves and they look good. She\\u2019s totally impressed. But I still have this in the back of my mind that I need to hurry up and get my stuff and go. But she\\u2019s like, \\u201cShow me another one.\\u201d So I go to do the same moves but on the other side - my drunk side. I\\u2019m not as good on the drunk side. I don\\u2019t hang onto the pole and I\\u2019m falling off. I feel rushed anyway. So I mess it up. I don't fall off the pole, but I get off real quick. She leaves. I go to gather my stuff again because I still don\\u2019t have everything because I was on the pole. I\\u2019m trying to change my shoes. I get my shoes on. In my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy are you putting these heels on? You\\u2019re going to have to get in the car and drive. It\\u2019s hard to drive in heels. You should just leave your flats on.\\u201d I get my bag. It\\u2019s one of those sports bags that have shoes and my lunch and my earrings - I haven\\u2019t put my earrings back on. I go to leave and I\\u2019m rushed because everybody is waiting on me. We walk out the back door. I\\u2019m no longer in town. As soon as I go out the back door, I\\u2019m somewhere else. I\\u2019m not entirely sure where I am. There\\u2019s a train like the sugarcane train that\\u2019s in Maui that is open on all sides. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I gotta catch this train.\\u201d I get on the train. I am still messing with my shoes and I don\\u2019t get off at my stop. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, well it\\u2019s okay, I\\u2019ll keep riding the train.\\u201d I think maybe I\\u2019ll walk home. I don\\u2019t know why I decide to stay on the train instead of getting off at my stop. Now the train goes and it\\u2019s long past any of my stops. We\\u2019re passing a ton of ocean - there\\u2019s this large expanse of ocean on my right side. The train is on land still, but all of this ocean passes and suddenly I\\u2019m in Lahaina, on Maui. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh I\\u2019m really screwed now. There\\u2019s no way for me to get home.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left my phone at work - at the grocery store. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay, well maybe i can just get off at this stop and I\\u2019ll walk home.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019m going to walk home. It\\u2019s so far for me to get home. So I go to get off the train at this one stop as I hear the conductor say, \\u201cAnybody for this street?\\u201d The street names are all in Hawaiian. It looks like we\\u2019re on Front Street in Lahaina, at least parts of it look like what I remember Front STreet looking like. So I go to get off and then I realize, \\u201cNope, I can\\u2019t.\\u201d I realize I\\u2019ve left that sports travel duffel bag on the train, too. So, the train goes into town and then it starts to reverse a little bit and backs up for a couple of stops. I get off at the stop closest to home, except it\\u2019s still miles and miles away. I get off and then I realize I can\\u2019t get off and this is silly of me. There\\u2019s no way I can get anywhere and I left my bag on the train. So I get back on and go to get my bag. But now I don\\u2019t know what to do because the train is going to go forward again. I\\u2019m just going to be further away from home than I want to be. But if I get off here, there\\u2019s no one for me to call to get me home and I don\\u2019t have my phone with me. I think, \\u201cWell, my dad lives in Lahaina.\\u201d But even then, I can\\u2019t call him and I don\\u2019t want to be with or near him anyway.\"],[\"I\\u2019m bleeding and it\\u2019s not my time to bleed.\"],[\"I\\u2019m dreaming that I was over a river, maybe standing on a bridge, and watching children and their teacher swim across. They were working on some kind of project and swimming back and forth across the river. The big part of the dream that stands out is that I was holding a baby and it was someone else\\u2019s baby. They handed the baby to me and said, \\u201cFeed it.\\u201d I looked at them confused because it wasn\\u2019t my baby and I had no milk to feed it. Whoever handed it to me, the baby\\u2019s mother, did something to me so my breasts were lactating. I remember my breasts hurting. I could feel the feeling of let-down but also the soreness of when you\\u2019ve just started breastfeeding or your baby has nursed a little too hard and your nipples are sensitive. I could feel that and the pressure of being engorged. I couldn\\u2019t feed the baby fast enough. I kept trying. The baby had a plastic face shield that everyone is wearing these days and it couldn\\u2019t get to the milk. I tried to lift the face shield up so it could latch on, but the baby just couldn\\u2019t get latched on in the right way. I remember feeling frustrated but also scared for the baby because I couldn\\u2019t feed it and wasn\\u2019t able to give it what it needed. I also remember the pain of being engorged and not being able to nurse.\"],[\"I\\u2019m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger\\u2019s seat. We\\u2019re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I\\u2019m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex\\u2019s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It\\u2019s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she\\u2019s there, but I\\u2019m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There\\u2019s only one white man in the entire house. It\\u2019s so interesting. I\\u2019m noticing all of this. They\\u2019re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There\\u2019s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the \\u201cI feel\\u201d and \\u201cI experience\\u201d and \\u201cWhen this happened, it made me feel like this\\u201d language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It\\u2019s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, \\u201cOh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.\\u201d I start to get this nagging feeling that it\\u2019s time for us to continue on our road trip. I\\u2019ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it\\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. I\\u2019m cleaning up my space. It\\u2019s like an Airbnb, so I\\u2019m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she\\u2019s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I\\u2019m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I\\u2019m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I\\u2019m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it\\u2019s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don\\u2019t, and I change my clothes. I\\u2019m kind of damp. I don\\u2019t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I\\u2019m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren\\u2019t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.\"],[\"I\\u2019m giving a session to Gemma outside in a courtyard. There\\u2019s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He\\u2019s good friends with Gemma, maybe they\\u2019re lovers. I\\u2019m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don\\u2019t feel like I\\u2019m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she\\u2019s going to the dinner later. I\\u2019m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, \\u201cThank you, that was really great.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting feedback but there isn\\u2019t time. Some other things happen and it\\u2019s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can\\u2019t come in because he\\u2019s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It\\u2019s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I\\u2019m not quite sure what they are because they\\u2019ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn\\u2019t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn\\u2019t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they\\u2019re much larger than me. I\\u2019m either really far away or I\\u2019ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I\\u2019m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It\\u2019s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It\\u2019s an ornate room with wood floors. There\\u2019s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they\\u2019re going to trap me, I\\u2019ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month\\u2019s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I\\u2019m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it\\u2019s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn\\u2019t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji\\u2019s ashram comes in and she\\u2019s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I\\u2019m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn\\u2019t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, \\u201cThey\\u2019ve been banished and will never be able to return. You\\u2019re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.\\u201d She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.\\u201d She laughs. I\\u2019m hoping she doesn\\u2019t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don\\u2019t realize that I\\u2019m the one who took the entire community\\u2019s water.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to a theatre show with my mom, sister and two other women. There\\u2019s five of us. We are walking down the steps to the seats. I\\u2019m wearing a silk blue gown and a fur stole. I\\u2019m trying to wrap it around my neck in an elegant way, but look quite awkward. We thought we were early, but as we try to find our seats, we have trouble finding five in a row. There are some openings for four seats, but not five. The chairs are plush red velvet. We\\u2019re walking up the aisle looking for a spot. People are saving empty seats with clothing and other items. We have to walk pretty far away from the stage to find a row, but eventually do. We file in and I take note of the people around us. After the show, which I don\\u2019t recall, we go out to a balcony. A man joins me. He is a little creepy. He puts headphones on me. He also has a set. He plays a short meditation on his iphone. I\\u2019m supposed to drop in and have a consciousness altering experience. But I\\u2019m worried about what his ulterior motive might be. Then some light dance music comes on. I\\u2019m still somewhat listening but others come out on the deck and I\\u2019m wanting to interact with them. A man talks to the creepy guy about his coaching program. I somehow see a digital display of this program. It\\u2019s based on the life, death and rebirth of Jesus. I comment on transformation as a moment of life and how it relates to Jesus\\u2019 death on the cross. I\\u2019m quite intrigued by the life design coaching program and want to know more. A tidal wave is coming, but people are in the ocean, on the beach, and standing on the balcony nearby watching unconcerned. We\\u2019re trying to warn them so they survive. I climb up onto a wooden lifeguard stand with some other people. We are looking out at a crowd. There is some kind of trial or judgement happening. They pass a microphone up to us on the stand. The creepy man who is maybe not so creepy anymore is up on the stand. He hides his face so they won\\u2019t recognize him as he speaks in favor of the person being judged. I have to get away. I know that Mary is somewhere in the crowd and she needs to get away, too.\"],[\"I\\u2019m going to get two cats that I had dropped off. But when we get them, they\\u2019re adolescent tigers. They\\u2019re nuzzling each other. We\\u2019re petting them and they\\u2019re playful. I\\u2019m surprised that they\\u2019re tigers now. Then I see our old dog who we rehomed years ago because he needed a different situation, but then he ended up dying. He\\u2019s old and blind and bleeding. I grab him to rehabilitate him. He looks very sad.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I do not know. We\\u2019re shopping and then we\\u2019re at a hotel. We\\u2019re sharing a room with doors that open to the outside. It\\u2019s Victorian style or like a plantation home, it kind of reminds me of Gone With the Wind. It also reminds me of Disneyland because you can go out and be right on the street with rides and stuff. We\\u2019re all sharing this room. People are coming in and out. We\\u2019re all naked but it doesn\\u2019t seem to matter. There\\u2019s one person or being who is a light bluish green with long legs, maybe ten feet tall, long arms and reddish auburn hair that hits their shoulders. I think the being is masculine but I\\u2019m not sure. We\\u2019re hanging around with them. There are all these women - daughters and their mother. They are Australian have blond hair and super tan skin. They\\u2019re trying on clothes. It\\u2019s comical from my point of view. I\\u2019m lying in bed and watching these ladies try on their clothes and talk about their day. I don\\u2019t have any clothes on and am waiting for the room to empty so I can get up and get dressed. It never empties so I just get up and get dressed. We\\u2019re mostly naked all the time and there\\u2019s no shame or embarrassment. There are no men around except for maybe this blue being who may or may not be mascuiine, I can\\u2019t tell. We leave the hotel room on an adventure. I think we\\u2019re heading to the beach. Men keep pointing at this blue being and making fun. They\\u2019re being obnoxious. I\\u2019m getting annoyed and am like, \\u201cCan you just fucking stop and let this person be?\\u201d I\\u2019m worried for the being. Then in another part of the dream, there\\u2019s a class. I don't know the topic. I don\\u2019t have to be there because I know what it\\u2019s all about. Even though it\\u2019s mandatory for me to take the test, I choose not to go to the class. I get to the classroom and everyone has taken the test. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them. They\\u2019re at their desks and the teacher is standing up at the front of the classroom with a blackboard or whiteboard behind them. I go to take the test and the teacher is like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how well you\\u2019re going to do because you weren\\u2019t even here for the lecture.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to be fine because I know this material, it\\u2019s pretty common sense, and I\\u2019m creative.\\u201d We go to take the test and sure enough, it\\u2019s something I can totally do. I pass everything. In another part of the dream I\\u2019m with a little girl. We\\u2019re on an adventure together but it's a little bit creepy because no matter where we are, it\\u2019s just us two. I think there is a dog. We\\u2019re doing things like jumping rock formations with one a little above the other and the drop is at least a hundred feet with lava underneath, like in a video game. We\\u2019re moving through this landscape. At one point we sit down to try and feed the dog. I think there are people or things chasing us. We have a mission. Scene change: I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood at night. I\\u2019m walking down this street. The houses on the left are up higher than the houses on the right and the street runs through the middle. The houses on the left, when you look at them, the windows are facing out towards the view and there is landscaping in the front. The houses on the right are lower and that\\u2019s the entrance with fences and archways and little cement steps onto the porches. So it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m looking at the front of the houses to my right and the back of the houses to my left. They\\u2019re all really fancy. Everything is dressed up for Halloween so there\\u2019s decor, cobwebs, pumpkins and skeletons everywhere. As I go down the street, I finally get to a part with a dedicated walkway with stairs and handrails that lead down. I start to walk down and on the left hand side is a gorgeous inn that looks like a historical landmark. It\\u2019s all red with a ton of windows and white shutters. I can tell the color even in the dark.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with a bunch of people I don\\u2019t know from waking life, but in the dream I recognize them as co-workers. We\\u2019re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they\\u2019re working. I work there, too, but I\\u2019m there on my day off. We\\u2019re talking. I\\u2019m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I\\u2019m barefoot and I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There\\u2019s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don\\u2019t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I\\u2019m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There\\u2019s some other way that I\\u2019m helping these co-workers. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s an energetic helping or if I\\u2019m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They\\u2019re both younger women. I\\u2019m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn\\u2019t super clear. I just know I\\u2019m in the store with them and we\\u2019re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I\\u2019m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I\\u2019ve been hanging out with say, \\u201cOh, we have something for you.\\u201d All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we\\u2019re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There\\u2019s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don\\u2019t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, \\u201cWe have these shoes for you.\\u201d These boots are pretty incredible. They\\u2019re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I \\u2018m looking at these boots, the heel doesn\\u2019t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it\\u2019s like I\\u2019m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It\\u2019s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I\\u2019m so, so tall. I love them and they\\u2019re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I\\u2019m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, \\u201cOf course you\\u2019re that tall in those shoes. That\\u2019s how tall you are. That\\u2019s who you are.\\u201d But I\\u2019m surprised. I didn\\u2019t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I\\u2019ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There\\u2019s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It\\u2019s an interesting mix because we\\u2019re in quarantine and we can\\u2019t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I\\u2019m thinking that for someone who\\u2019s never driven a huge tour bus before, he\\u2019s doing a pretty good job. I don\\u2019t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I\\u2019m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it\\u2019s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I\\u2019m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I\\u2019m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it\\u2019s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren\\u2019t going to tip him. I say, \\u201cYou have to tip him. That\\u2019s how this works.\\u201d I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it\\u2019s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I\\u2019m not stoked to be there. I\\u2019m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there\\u2019s stuff everywhere. It\\u2019s a mess. It\\u2019s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I\\u2019m somewhere I don\\u2019t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There\\u2019s definitely friction here. I\\u2019m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.\"],[\"I\\u2019m hanging out with Josh, my beloved. We\\u2019re going to a Dane Cook show - the compedian (I haven\\u2019t listened to his shit in at least ten years). We\\u2019re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It\\u2019s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They\\u2019re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It\\u2019s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he\\u2019s done. I\\u2019m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it\\u2019s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term \\u201csausage fest\\u201d is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I\\u2019m a little confused as to why I\\u2019m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he\\u2019s finished with the set. He\\u2019s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, \\u201cWell, because you\\u2019re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell, whatever!\\u201d I\\u2019m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don\\u2019t know if Josh is still with me. I\\u2019m watching a soccer game. It\\u2019s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They\\u2019re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I\\u2019m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I\\u2019m not playing, I\\u2019m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I\\u2019m not sure who the team is that we\\u2019re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I\\u2019m wanting to play so bad. We\\u2019re outdoors at a soccer field and I\\u2019m actually sitting under a tree, it\\u2019s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I\\u2019m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I\\u2019m not playing and I\\u2019m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I\\u2019m not invited to play and it\\u2019s been a really long time since I\\u2019ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there\\u2019s busy work that has to happen. I\\u2019m watching the field morph. I can\\u2019t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I\\u2019m not part of it and I\\u2019m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don\\u2019t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn\\u2019t recognize me. There\\u2019s my other friend Nani who I\\u2019ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m busy and I\\u2019ve gotta go.\\u201d She does sit with me for a little bit. While we\\u2019re sitting there, another girl comes up - I\\u2019m saying \\u201cgirl\\u201d because everyone is a teenager - and she\\u2019s got a project she\\u2019s working on. I ask her to show me. There\\u2019s wire wrapped around a needle and she\\u2019s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: \\u201cI can show you but I\\u2019m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.\\u201d It\\u2019s like she\\u2019s almost off work with the job she\\u2019s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she\\u2019s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, \\u201cOkay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you\\u2019re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.\\u201d She\\u2019s a local girl, so I can feel this air of \\u201cIck, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?\\u201d That\\u2019s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m heading home to the home I grew up in on the Big Island of Hawaii. I\\u2019m in a car. There are people with me, I think my siblings. It\\u2019s pouring rain - the kind where the roads are flooding. To get into the street that turns onto my cul-de-sac, we go over a stream. The stream is directly under the road but has come up over the road. I have to park the car. The siblings in the car are with me, but we\\u2019re not interacting - they\\u2019re kind of shadowed in the background. I have to get across the water to get into the cul-de-sac, so the car is parked. There are all these road workers here to help us. I get out and they\\u2019re very specific in showing me how to cross it. They\\u2019re going to help me get over it. They say, \\u201cThis part right here is deeper because the water has worn so much of the road away. But we\\u2019ve put some rocks down right here for you to walk across.\\u201d I get the sense that there\\u2019s also a small child with me because I\\u2019m being extra careful because I have to help them get across, too. I think it\\u2019s actually my son. The workers help us across this water and it is pretty deep, but because the rocks are there, it only goes up to our knees. Then we cross over and get onto the road. It stops raining and there\\u2019s no more water, but it is wet. We walk past a neighbor\\u2019s house. They have strawberry guava growing in their yard and it\\u2019s ripe. So I stop and I pick a bunch to eat and a bunch to take with me to save for later or turn into jam or jelly. I show my son and he\\u2019s eating some of them. We continue down the road. We walk down the road a little bit and turn right to head down the street to my house. So, we\\u2019re walking that way. We\\u2019ve hit the end where there\\u2019s a stop sign and we\\u2019re turning down to the right. To the left, I can see the horse pasture my friend used to have her horses in. I am recognizing all the houses and am like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m home, I\\u2019m home!\\u201d It feels good and normal. Then I\\u2019m walking down the street to our house. It\\u2019s different. Now my brothers have shown up. I don't think my sister is there, but we haven\\u2019t interacted yet. We get to the house. The house is different. The first thing we do is we all go into the backyard to see the stream because the stream we grew up with was such an important part of our lives, but we\\u2019d heard that our neighbor Andy had dug out his side of the stream. We get there and I look at it. The far side is a big wall that he dug out. It used to be that you could walk down the slope of our backyard into the stream and you could cross it to the other side and on the other side was a hill. There was a cow pasture and a barbed wire on the other side that you would have to cross, then walk up this hill or ridge. At the top you could see far out to a lava desert. But now, in the dream, that hill doesn\\u2019t exist. It\\u2019s just a rock wall. Instead of being flat where you could see the layers, it\\u2019s pebbled - you see this sometimes when you dig out all the layers of rock. The rocks are round and stacked on top of each other. They\\u2019re jutting out of the wall. My brothers are really sad that it\\u2019s been dug out. But I think it\\u2019s beautiful and also say, \\u201cOh my god, I dreamt about this. I dreamt this happened to the stream.\\u201d It\\u2019s created caves on the far side underneath the wall and I think it looks beautiful now. But my siblings are really upset. We turn around and it\\u2019s time to go into the house. My mom and dad are there, but the house has been changed. They live in separate parts of the house - my mom lives in the big part. Somehow there\\u2019s a sidewalk or the road is in between or underneath forming a causeway, and you have to cross the causeway to the part where my dad lives. My mom and dad are kind of getting along. They\\u2019re a little snippy with each other. But it\\u2019s clear that my mom never goes into my dad\\u2019s side. You have to go up these stairs and then walk across this causeway and it opens up into a room that\\u2019s above everything. The room looks like an attic and there\\u2019s enough stuff that it could be an attic. There are all these paintings, photographs and pictures nailed to the wall. What sticks out in my mind is that this little causeway I walk over is just plywood placed over a bunch of joists and it\\u2019s not particularly safe and the thought crosses my mind, \\u201cOh my dad is old and he shouldn\\u2019t be walking on this kind of floor where you have to walk on the joists so the plywood doesn\\u2019t tip up at the corners and come off.\\u201d It seems strange to me. My brothers are with me and we\\u2019re all going. Now my friend Dorian, who I grew up in this neighborhood, is with us, too. He\\u2019s there and keeps asking all these poignant questions. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to help me and my parents reconcile. That\\u2019s his role. He has a very loving presence. My whole life he had a loving presence, always very kind. This is radiating from him. So I look at this place where my dad is living. He says, \\u201cDo you like it? Do you like the way it\\u2019s decorated?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at all of these pictures. The walls are made of plywood and not painted, so the pictures are fading into the backaryd. There are all these pictures of ships and oceans with clouds over the top, like old-fashioned oil paintings. For whatever reason, the colors used for all three paintings match the same shades and tones of the plywood walls and they\\u2019re fading into the background. So I look at him and say, \\u201cIf you paint just this section with all the paintings white, you\\u2019ll be able to see the paintings better.\\u201d He crosses his arms in the way he used to and puts one hand up to his mouth and does the thing he used to do - stop and think and nod for a little bit. Then he moves out of the picture. Now my mom is front and center. We\\u2019re in the same space, but now the space has transformed and it\\u2019s hers. So my dad is there, but it\\u2019s not his space anymore. She has work to do. She always had work to do when we were growing up. There\\u2019s a computer on a desk that\\u2019s now in this space and piles of paperwork. But she also has piles of makeup. She says, \\u201cOh I have to get to a trial. Doyou think you can help me look good for this trial?\\u201d When I was growing up, I always thought my mom did her makeup so shitty because she never changed the way she did it from the 60s - weird blue eyeshadow and clumpy mascara. She just didn\\u2019t have a lot of skill with her makeup. So in the dream, she\\u2019s asking me to do it, because she knows I know how to do makeup. I\\u2019m looking at all this makeup she has. She has ten or twelve of the exact same eyeshadows and lip creams and all these things she wouldn\\u2019t wear because they are way too bright - they\\u2019re not the right color. She also has this makeup brush I need to use. So I put all this foundation on her face to smooth out her skin. It\\u2019s thick and way too much. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMom, if you\\u2019re going to have me do this, y0ou need to trust me and let me rub this in.\\u201d So I take this brush and I\\u2019m trying to rub it in. She\\u2019s sort of fighting me about it and I\\u2019m getting exasperated. I say, \\u201cStop, let me do this. You asked me to do this. Stop.\\u201d My friend Darisu is there and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, let her do this. You\\u2019re going to have to trust her to rub the makeup in.\\u201d I finally get her face to be a blank slate with all the foundation. It takes a while with this one brush. In the meantime I ask her why she has twelve of this one compact. She looks at my dad and says, \\u201cWell, he was trying to order me a surprise, but he ordered like twelve of them and now I have twelve of these things I never use.\\u201d In my head, I think, \\u201cThat was always your relationship. He was always trying to do nice, kind things for you, but he got it wrong by just a little bit. It would have been lovely if he had ordered the right amount and the right shade of these compacts, but instead he ordered twelve of a color you can never use. But instead of you communicating to him that you didn\\u2019t like that, you just got annoyed with him, rolled your eyes and totally disrespected him.\\u201dIn the dream, I\\u2019m watching that dynamic play out. I want out of it. It\\u2019s not my business. I can tell it\\u2019s them. I was thinking it was just her normal hoarding habits, but it turns out it came from my dad, at least in this aspect of the dream. We go to where her eyeshadows are because it\\u2019s time for me to do her eyes. She has a ton of different colors. I know that is actually her. In this part, she just wanted all of these things for herself. So I pick out an eyeshadow. What\\u2019s fascinating is I pick out this blue that is dark blue glitter, drag queen style. She\\u2019s looking at me and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cJust trust me.\\u201d So I goto put it on and she keeps flinching and moving out of the way. Dorian tells her, \\u201cYou have to hold still. You have to trust her. Let her do this.\\u201d In the meantime, I\\u2019m concentrating so hard to put this eyeshadow on her and make her look nice, I get the sense that we\\u2019re running out of time because she has to hurry up and get to the trial. There\\u2019s also a part when we had gone into the house, there were a couple of cats. These cats are small like house cats but their fur looks like a cheetah - wild cats - and there\\u2019s one here. I\\u2019m talking to it and looking at it. It\\u2019s talking back as a sentient guide in this dream. It\\u2019s acting like a human. It\\u2019s got a pink underlayer. It\\u2019s fur is almost holographic, so it turns pink when it moves, but it still has the cheetah spots. I look up and there\\u2019s this cat print or motif in this attic/annex that she\\u2019s in that has all her makeup, work desk and other stuff. It\\u2019s very striking to me, because at one point in the dream, the cat wants to be held. I\\u2019m holding and petting it, but it\\u2019s purring and chewing on my finger and telling me stories. When I\\u2019m doing my mom\\u2019s makeup, I see this cat print everywhere - on the pillows, the wall, upholstering of a chair. She\\u2019s wearing some, too. I finally finished with her makeup and am not sure if this looks good because she wouldn't let me do it the way I wanted to do. But she\\u2019s gotta go. She says thank you and goes off to the trial. Then the dream changes completely and I\\u2019m with a friend. She\\u2019s a business coach. She takes me to one of her client\\u2019s houses and her client is doing quite well and so is the client\\u2019s husband because they live in a really nice house. I can see the ocean out of the windows and off the balcony of their house. The inside is very modern looking and minimalist, so there\\u2019s not a lot in it in contrast to my parents\\u2019 house. There are beautiful wood floors and tall walls with tall windows. The walls are painted grey and the furniture is black. It\\u2019s all elegant, very understated and minimalistic. There\\u2019s a gathering of people because this woman is telling her story of how she got to be a wealthy business woman. I\\u2019m in the audience. She talks about how hard she works and how she couldn\\u2019t have done it without my friend who is the business coach. Then the business coach says, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you talk with Cinnamon?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m talking with this woman and her husband. They want to know what I do and how I got to what I\\u2019m doing. I tell the whole story of all the different aspects of my life that came together to this point of where I\\u2019m a priestess who helps people be in their bodies and how that happened through me getting a degree in exercise science and nutrition. She says, \\u201cOh, your story is very similar to mine. The only difference is I\\u2019m making a ton of money.\\u201dI look at her and am like, \\u201cYup, I just haven\\u2019t cracked that money thing yet. Haven\\u2019t figured that out.\\u201d My coach is like, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m having you meet her and tell the story because i wanted you to see how exactly similar the two of you are. You could do it at any point.\\u201d The husband was listening to the story and very supportive. Both of them are people of color. She may be Asian and he could maybe have some Arab blood. In the meantime, I can hear and see the ocean. It\\u2019s gotten stormy outside and there\\u2019s whitecaps on the water. But even though the house is very close to the edge of the water, I feel safe. I\\u2019m not too worried about the water coming up, but I can see it spraying up on the windows, which is very interesting. There\\u2019s a seagull outside trying to find a place to nest and land out of the wind. This is happening while she is telling her story and I am telling my story. Then at some point, I am sitting down. There is a sense of magic in this dream - as if these two people are my guides or my guides are orchestrating it or there are guides in the audience. I turn from our conversation and to a computer. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019ve been having conversations with other people. I look at the screen and see my friend Maria. She and I are having a flirtation through the computer screen. I can\\u2019t remember all the things we said, but I get the feeling of space and distance between us that is happening in real life - we are no longer friends in real life. I\\u2019m asking her, \\u201cWhere are you? Why aren\\u2019t we friends? Why aren\\u2019t we hanging out together?\\u201d I don\\u2019t remember her response. Also, somewhere in the dream, I\\u2019m having a conversation with my dad and he\\u2019s talking about Doug who is a guy who used to work for my mom. They have a condo that they bought together with somebody else. My dad keeps saying that Doug owes him money for the condo. I keep saying, \\u201cNobody has any money. What are you going to do about it?\\u201d My dad says, \\u201cWell the option has always been that he can pay money or do somworktrade to live there and his roommate can pay money.\\u201d I find it interesting that work trade is on the table as an option for living in this condo.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a boat. I\\u2019m with my husband and son and somebody else, a captain who is directing the boat. There are other boats in the water. We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I\\u2019m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he\\u2019s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I\\u2019m looking around and notice it\\u2019s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I\\u2019m looking through the papers and see that there\\u2019s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I\\u2019m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He\\u2019s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It\\u2019s really rough and she hasn\\u2019t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It\\u2019s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I\\u2019m at a celebration for Ted, an award\\u2019s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I\\u2019m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there. His dad, who is dead in waking life, is there and drinking a huge glass mug of whisky and ice. His mom and I are sipping nicer whisky that I had brought. I make eye contact with him, smile and nod my head in congratulations for his accomplishments.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a coffee shop and I see a friend of mine who is working there. I haven\\u2019t seen her for a while. I ask if she wants to hang out but it feels strange. She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it\\u2019s not very big, there\\u2019s not a lot of space. She\\u2019s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I\\u2019m asking her while she\\u2019s busy, and it\\u2019s not that she doesn\\u2019t want to hang out. The scene changes and I\\u2019m in a residential area of a town and I\\u2019m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I\\u2019m walking up a hill and she\\u2019s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I\\u2019m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She\\u2019s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It\\u2019s dark. It\\u2019s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It\\u2019s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don\\u2019t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They\\u2019re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I\\u2019m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It\\u2019s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there\\u2019s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there\\u2019s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I\\u2019m a little bit wary because there\\u2019s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don\\u2019t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don\\u2019t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I\\u2019m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It\\u2019s actually another sort of twilight, but it\\u2019s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it\\u2019s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I\\u2019m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it\\u2019s cordial. Suddenly he\\u2019s talking to me like we\\u2019re still lovers. I\\u2019m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle, don\\u2019t settle.\\u201d The voice is also telling me, \\u201cYou can still be kind, you can still be kind.\\u201d So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he\\u2019s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he\\u2019s going to take me with him. So we\\u2019ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there\\u2019s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It\\u2019s where he lives. He has an apartment. He\\u2019s very very familiar with me and I\\u2019m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He\\u2019s a surfer and he\\u2019s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he\\u2019s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I\\u2019m actually quite glad that he\\u2019s going. So again, I\\u2019m being as encouraging as possible. I\\u2019m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don\\u2019t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I\\u2019m just sending him off for a little bit and then he\\u2019ll be back. But in my mind I\\u2019m sending him off like he\\u2019s going off on a quest and I won't\\u2019 see him for a long while. I\\u2019m relieved that I wont\\u2019 see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he\\u2019s really proud of. I\\u2019m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he\\u2019s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I\\u2019m satisfied with how I\\u2019ve handled all of it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a condo - it\\u2019s huge. There\\u2019s a huge kitchen. The living room is gigantic. The bathroom has two separate showers. There\\u2019s a balcony that I walk out onto and can see the ocean from it. I live in this condo with my kids. They\\u2019re not here with me right now, but I feel comfortable here. All of my stuff is in the condo. Now my ex is here with me and we\\u2019re being cordial with each other. He\\u2019s actually even really friendly and seems happy to see me. I notice he has some of his stuff with him and it bothers me that he\\u2019s brought it and put it into the condo. This condo is one that I received in the divorce and yet somehow he is able to buy it and take it for himself. I\\u2019m not clear on why he\\u2019s even there, except that all of a sudden, I can feel that his energy is moving into this place with me. I decide to go take a shower and he decides he\\u2019ll go take a shower, too. I don\\u2019t want him anywhere near me and I don\\u2019t want him to see me naked. I go to take a shower and his desk and other office stuff is in the shower stall so I can\\u2019t get in. I\\u2019m really mad because I did not say okay - I did not say it was alright for him to move his stuff in there and to be in this place. I\\u2019m starting to get agitated and his demeanor is changing from one of kindness and being happy to see me to really domineering. I ask him to take his stuff out of the shower, but it\\u2019s taking him forever, so I just decide not to and I leave. Then I say, \\u201cYou know we have to have the conversation because this isn\\u2019t what I want and this isn\\u2019t true and this isn\\u2019t going to last. Now he gets really shut down. We actually walk out of the condo into a lobby type area that\\u2019s part of the complex. There\\u2019s a huge Christmas tree in the lobby area. We can see out to the ocean from where we\\u2019re standing. I tell him I don\\u2019t want him living with me or in my space and that he needs to leave. But he tells me that he owns the condo and it is his now and that I can\\u2019t stay there. We go back up to the condo and I\\u2019m racking my brain because I don\\u2019t have any place to go. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to go and I don\\u2019t have any money. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going to live where the kids can be with me. I start to pack up all my stuff and as I\\u2019m doing so, his girlfriend comes in. We sit down at the table in the kitchen. It\\u2019s an oval table with a couple of leaves in it. The chairs don\\u2019t match. In fact one of the chairs is a lot shorter. It kind of makes me laugh, but I don\\u2019t sit in that one. He tells me that he now owns the condo, that it\\u2019s his place and he\\u2019s going to share it with the girlfriend. I ask him how much he pays every month and he says they split the $5,000 monthly mortgage. I know that is not something I can pay. I see that the kids - her kids and our kids - are there and they\\u2019re running around. They\\u2019re happy to be in this space. I know I\\u2019m not going to live there with them. So I gather as much of my things as I can and I leave. I don\\u2019t know exactly what I\\u2019m going to do. I know the kids are okay for now, so that\\u2019s alright. As I walk out the front door, he walks with me and he\\u2019s essentially escorting me out and off the properties. We\\u2019re walking through this neighborhood that looks really familiar and I realize I\\u2019ve been in this neighborhood before. Down at the end of the neighborhood is a crystal mine. I\\u2019ve been to this crystal mine before and I can\\u2019t remember when or why, I just remember there\\u2019s crystals there. We walk by a house whose roof is being replaced. The woman who owns the house is on top of it and the roof is being replaced with large large tumbled crystals. They are huge stones and she\\u2019s sliding them into these lanes that fit on top of her roof. She\\u2019s about an eighth of the way done. I watch as she climbs down the ladder. She has these special shoes on and walks out to the crystal mine. My ex and I are still walking and we start to follow her. But I want him to leave because there\\u2019s no reason for him to be near me. Then the scene shifts.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a conference center. I\\u2019ve happened upon a group of people. They all look like they work with nature conservation in some way - forestry, seed saving, permaculture, climate change, soil, etc. I\\u2019m really interested in what\\u2019s happening here. I just sort of add myself to the group. This is the first day of their meeting. Everyone circles up and they all have name tags except me. The guide notices I don\\u2019t have a name tag and she asks if I registered for the day. I tell her no and I didn\\u2019t know about this until I just happened upon it, but I feel like I really need to be here. She stops for a bit and thinks about what I\\u2019ve said then says, \\u201cOkay, come with me.\\u201d Everyone breaks for gathering their things and getting ready for the day of being on the land and learning about the seeds, roots, berries, flowers and their conservation as well as their medicinal uses. I\\u2019m walking with the guide. She is a young woman with long blond hair. She has grown up in relationship with the land. We are at Esalen - my dream form of Esalen. We need to get permission from the front office so that I can be here, even though I\\u2019m not planning to stay overnight. They still need to register me for the course. We\\u2019re looking, but can\\u2019t find anyone with authority. We stop at her trailer so she can get a certificate and papers for me. The trailer is really interesting. I recognize it as somewhere I\\u2019ve been before, even though I haven\\u2019t in waking life. The trailer is reserved for visiting faculty. Before the closets were full of Burning Man style costume clothes that the teachers could wear around the campus. Another wall is lined with narrow shelves filled with small cylindrical bottles of herbs of all colors. There\\u2019s another set of wider shelves in the corner by the bed with books. It\\u2019s a sweet and comfortable place. I notice that the clothes have been traded out for doll-sized clothes, so it\\u2019s more for decoration than use. It\\u2019s a new COVID policy shift, so it still has the old flavor of how things used to be, but now the clothes can\\u2019t actually be worn. She gets what she needs and fills her bag for the day of teaching on the land. We leave. We pass through a dining area. They are just now putting out lunch. She suggests we stay for lunch. It\\u2019s a spread of delicious mini sliders - hamburgers and hot dogs with gourmet toppings, and caprese vegetarian ones. It all looks so beautiful and delicious. I surreptitiously reach for one and eat it, trying to look like I\\u2019m not actually chewing because I\\u2019m not registered and I\\u2019m not really supposed to be here. She is sitting at a table with colleagues and I go back for more because it\\u2019s so tasty! I want to try at least one of everything. I see my friend Mo from graduate school. I\\u2019m happily surprised to see him. He looks a bit sad. He tells me he\\u2019s been spending more time in San Francisco. I think that\\u2019s interesting because he lives in the East Bay. He says he\\u2019s been in SF more because he and his wife aren\\u2019t really doing well right now. He was married four or more years after me. I tell him he\\u2019ll be fine and his marriage will be okay because there are phases in a marriage when you don\\u2019t feel super connected, but you\\u2019ll come out of it and appreciate each other again. He\\u2019s hopeful but a bit weary to put his hope in my words. I look around and see that my guide has left. I tell him I have to go and hope to see him around later. I am looking for the group again. I\\u2019m in the huge conference center with many floors. There are start-up companies in meeting, people working on computers, miniature libraries with specialized topics for research. I\\u2019m wandering around and feeling lost. I find a woman sitting behind a glass - it looks like an information desk. I ask her about the group I\\u2019m looking for. She says, \\u201cI\\u2019m more in charge of the people who rent space here for months and years rather than day visits.\\u201d She comes out from behind the glass and we go down the elevator. We get to an area that she says is their meeting space. It\\u2019s not at all familiar. I look way down and think I recognize some of the people. I really want to find them because I really want to go on this learning trek and know this is important knowledge to gather. She leaves me there and I\\u2019m trying to find my way down to the people. I feel at a complete loss and I\\u2019m lost.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a garage sitting in a lawn chair. I think I\\u2019m with my dad. We\\u2019re shooting the shit and doing a running commentary on the people we can see out of the garage opening who are coming across the opening. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood. I don\\u2019t remember what we\\u2019re talking about. At some point in the dream, I go, \\u201cWait, I have to record this dream for Ana!\\u201d I record the dream for her in the dream. I play it back for myself in the dream and it\\u2019s all mumbled. I can\\u2019t understand myself and I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m not speaking English or if I just mumbled the whole time or what happened. The playback is really garbled. The scene changes. I remember a big pool of water and hockey sticks. My youngest brother was there. We were doing something, but that has escaped me.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a grocery store and it\\u2019s very dark out. It\\u2019s not night, but there are dark clouds. Everything is dark out and even the grocery store is dark and dreary even though there are fluorescent lights. It\\u2019s pretty packed with people. I have a cart and I\\u2019m shopping for the kids. I\\u2019m doing the week\\u2019s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I\\u2019m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me. I\\u2019m walking through the aisles and my kids and are talking about what they want for dinner. Then my ex shows up and he says, \\u201cWell you can\\u2019t actually have the kids. You\\u2019re not going to get to spend a lot of time with them. You\\u2019re just shopping, then I\\u2019m going to take all of this and leave with the kids.\\u201d I\\u2019m fucking pissed that he\\u2019s treating me like that and talking me like that and manipulating the kids in front of me. I can see that they\\u2019re torn because they were just having a great time with me, but when he showed up, their allegiance went straight to him. He\\u2019s saying he\\u2019s just going to take the groceries and all this because he\\u2019s paying for them. I\\u2019m so done with him and seeing the kids frustrated that I say, \\u201cNo, you do it. I\\u2019m out of here. I\\u2019m not going to participate in this.\\u201d The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very \\u201cfuck you\\u2019ish\\u201d way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It\\u2019s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I\\u2019m so mad, but I\\u2019m very clear that I\\u2019m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I\\u2019m not playing his game. I\\u2019m not doing it his way.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a home, I don\\u2019t know whose it is and I don\\u2019t recognize it, but I think it\\u2019s mine. I\\u2019m getting on a plane in the morning and I have the ticket and am getting ready. I don\\u2019t know what time I need to be there. I just know that tomorrow is the day I\\u2019m flying. I\\u2019m a little bit younger, maybe a teenager. I\\u2019m excited for what\\u2019s happening tomorrow. I go to bed, then get up in the morning and start packing. Maybe it\\u2019s 9 or 10 in the morning. My dad comes in out of nowhere and is like, \\u201cHey, what time is your flight?\\u201d I go to look at the ticket - it\\u2019s an old fashioned ticket stub - and the flight was at 5am. Clearly I\\u2019ve missed it and I\\u2019m panicking. I ask him if he can call the airlines and see if we can change the flight. I\\u2019m still not packed. I\\u2019m going to another country. There\\u2019s a sense of, \\u201cDammit, Rose, how did you not look at the ticket stub right in front of you and make sure you were ready to go at the time you needed to get going?\\u201d I\\u2019m asking my dad to help, but feel like I should be doing it, not him. But I still need to finish packing. Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t I just imagine what it would be like to be in this country.\\u201d So I start imagining that I\\u2019ve kept the plane or I get on the plane and catch up to them. All of a sudden, I\\u2019m there with them. It\\u2019s a bunch of German kids speaking German. I don\\u2019t speak German, but they also speak English, so that\\u2019s okay. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s the girl that missed her flight.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cRight, but now I\\u2019m here.\\u201d It\\u2019s like a bunch of teenagers messing around. I\\u2019m standing in an airport looking at the teleprompter and they\\u2019re standing in front of it, bouncing around and teasing and laughing. We\\u2019re supposed to be doing something. There\\u2019s a chaperone somewhere trying to herd us and get us to our next destination and teach us some things. This part of the dream continues on but fades out. Then, Wendy is in my dreams somewhere and I find this bizarre because I haven\\u2019t dreamt of her in over a year and haven\\u2019t had any interaction with her at all. I don\\u2019t remember exactly what\\u2019s happening. I think we\\u2019re talking about babies.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a hotel conference room, sitting next to my mom. There are a lot of other people sitting in rows. I look down and see that I\\u2019m wearing a light blue leotard and a flimsy skirt made of scarves. It isn\\u2019t secured well to my waist. I see that my mom has elastic wrapped around her skirt and I ask to borrow some\\u2026.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house and my siblings are there as well as my mom and dad. My youngest brother is the one I\\u2019m interacting with. They\\u2019re young, it\\u2019s when they were babies. My ex is there, he\\u2019s somewhere in the mix. My current lover is with me, as well. We\\u2019re trying to clean the bedroom and get my younger brothers ready for school. It\\u2019s taking a long time and I\\u2019m getting frustrated trying to get them ready. My lover and I want to take a shower. We walk into the bathroom and the entire bathroom is covered in shit and grey water and toilet paper. It\\u2019s like a toilet backed up all the way to the ceiling. There are white tiles on the shower wall and the whole bathroom is white, but it\\u2019s covered in this grey old toilet paper and poop. We\\u2019re both standing there barefoot, having walked in and are like, \\u201coh my god, this is so gross,\\u201d but not having another option. We just had to clean it. We\\u2019re both naked and trying to clean it. It\\u2019s just so gross. At one point we fill the whole bathroom with water to wash it all away. Neither of us are happy about it. I have some feelings of embarrassment and I can tell my lover is annoyed, but it\\u2019s just something we have to do. So we clean it. Then we get my little brother off to a race - it\\u2019s like a go-cart race. We get him to the race in time after cleaning the disgusting bathroom. So gross.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house or residential school. I\\u2019m taking my examinations - writing, math and dance. Eac person has their own private space to write. I go outside to the yard with my blue books and find a stone grotto to sit in. it\\u2019s dark outside, night. After I finish writing, I go back inside for the dance examination. This is a small performance based audition. I enter into the audition late and displace another woman who was until now guaranteed a spot in the school. Afterward, people begin talking about my skill and wondering where I learned to dance like that. I walk into another room where they keep the wild leopards. There is a pool with rocks along the side and some trees - an attempt to replicate a watering hole in their natural environment. I see a huge one - a paleolithic version of the leopard. This one is standing on a rock in the water. A younger adolescent leopard is lying splayed out on the beach, mouth open wide and teeth showing - it reminds me of a skinned lion rug I\\u2019ve seen before in waking life. There\\u2019s also a paleolithic leopard kitten crawling around the rocks. I'm surprised to see these wild animals inside a concrete room without windows. I go to another room that is a workroom with tools, like a woodwork or metal shop.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house that is supposed to be my childhood home, but it\\u2019s been completely remodeled and changed. My parents are both there. I don\\u2019t know if I see my mom, but I do know she\\u2019s around. I do see my dad. I go into his study at one point and talk with him, which is weird because there definitely wasn\\u2019t a study in the house I grew up in. it\\u2019s got two stories. The upper story is where the kids\\u2019 bedrooms are there. My two younger brothers have their own bedrooms, and they\\u2019re younger, like seven or eight. I think I\\u2019m a teenager in this dream. Their bedrooms are really big and bright. They\\u2019ve got big windows. Everything is a mess, really messy. There\\u2019s food smeared in places, car toys and blocks everywhere on the bedroom floor. There is a nanny but she\\u2019s nowhere to be found. I think I walk out the doorway of my brother\\u2019s bedroom into the hallway and she\\u2019s in this little alcove, laying there eating something. She has food spilled on her. I think she\\u2019s pregnant, which is weird. No one is actually watching the kids. There\\u2019s also a goat running around the upper level of the house, I\\u2019m not sure why. I\\u2019m looking for my dad to ask him who\\u2019s watching the kids and who\\u2019s in charge here. I go into his study and he doesn\\u2019t really give me an answer. He\\u2019s not very there. He does talk to me but I don\\u2019t get an answer to my questions. I think my mom is in the kitchen but I don\\u2019t seek her out. I go back upstairs to my own bedroom. It doesn\\u2019t look anything like my bedroom that I actually grew up in. I go to the windows and look out and can see the house next to us is the house that was next door when I was growing up in Maui, Lahaina. It\\u2019s all this slapdash pieces of wood, it looks like a shed, but it\\u2019s a house. There\\u2019s laundry hung on the outside and these raised bed gardens, but it\\u2019s very rundown. That\\u2019s to my right. When I look straight out, instead of seeing more houses or the mountains I expect to see because that was the scene growing up, I see the ocean. The coastline goes down from my house, and there\\u2019s hibiscus and ti leaf growing. I see this channel and another island or land across the channel. In my dream I\\u2019m thinking that the landscape outside my house has changed to something completely different, how interesting that everything is restructuring. I realize that this is a restructuring dream of my inner landscape. Because I see the outer landscape restructured as well, I realize it\\u2019s a collective - everyone\\u2019s past stories are being rewritten so they are freed from the chaos on the inside. Then the dream changes. I\\u2019m on vacation and going on an adventure. I\\u2019m with Josh. we\\u2019re in a condo-apartment-hotel hybrid. The lights are on but it\\u2019s still dark. In my childhood house earlier in the dream, everything was really bright and sunny with lots of light coming through windows. In this, it\\u2019s dark and cold. I have my daughter and son with me, they\\u2019re maybe seven or five in this dream. There\\u2019s another little girl running around, but I\\u2019m not sure who she is. I have them for a little bit of time. But they\\u2019re both wanting to go back to their dad and don\\u2019t want to connect with me. Josh is making pancakes for them. One pancake drops on the floor and one of the kids just walks over it. He gets mad at them and then gets mad at me telling me I\\u2019m not disciplining my kids enough. I\\u2019m looking at him like, \\u201cWell, that was an accident and I don\\u2019t need to discipline them for stepping on a pancake that got dropped.\\u201d He gets upset that they\\u2019re not eating the pancakes at all. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell I\\u2019m not going to force them to do any of that. They keep saying they want to go back to their dad\\u2019s so the more I force them, the more they want to leave.\\u201d This whole time, the threat of my ex is hanging over me and that\\u2019s why it feels so dark and cold. I can feel it heavy in my chest with fear and frustration and a total inability to show up for my kids in the way I want to connect with them. They even look at me like I\\u2019m something to be feared or wary of, they don\\u2019t want to connect.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house that looks a lot like my grandmother\\u2019s house except the ceilings are really, really high. It\\u2019s like a modular home. I\\u2019m with my mom in the kitchen and my dad somewhere and my sister somewhere. My aunt is there, too. I guess the whole family that usually gathers for Thanksgiving is there. My mom is in the kitchen. I\\u2019m with her and we\\u2019re baking bread. The counters are already covered with loaves of bread. It smells so good! There are some artisan loaves that we\\u2019re just finishing up. We\\u2019ve just tried this new style of baking and we\\u2019re looking forward to trying it. I take those loaves out of the oven and place them on the counter. We slice some pieces of bread, sampling different loaves for the meal we\\u2019re preparing. I step out of the kitchen and walk down the hall. I go into my grandmother\\u2019s bedroom. This is when I notice the ceilings are really high and there\\u2019s a loft. Also, her bedroom is on the opposite side of the hall than it was in waking life. There\\u2019s a wall partition and around the corner is a big green bed, her bed. There\\u2019s a little area with toys - a little kids table and bright primary colors, a little hammer, balls and art supplies. She set it up for the grandchildren to play with. I see my aunt up the ladder on the loft preparing a couple beds for the family to sleep. There\\u2019s also a bed downstairs with a pink bedspread. We\\u2019re preparing the house so everyone can rest. I go out and see my sister and grandmother in the laundry room, which she also didn\\u2019t have in real life. They\\u2019re taking Christmas decorations out of boxes. They\\u2019re taking out candy canes that are individually wrapped in plastic, then wrapped again in bunches. My sister and grandmother are taking the candy canes out - they\\u2019re all different colors, rainbow, blue, purple, solid red. I don\\u2019t see the traditional red and white striped candy canes. It\\u2019s so good to see my grandmother even though I only see her from behind. It feels like Thanksgivings and Christmases in the past.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my ex again (this is the second night in a row). There is tension between the two of us. He says he\\u2019s moving and wants to take some of the furniture. We\\u2019re standing in the kid\\u2019s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it\\u2019s very dark in there. I see that there\\u2019s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don\\u2019t care if he takes them. There\\u2019s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I\\u2019m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I\\u2019m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I\\u2019m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I\\u2019m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I\\u2019m still a mother. I still have two children. They\\u2019re still with me. And my godmother says let\\u2019s just go. All of a sudden we\\u2019re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I\\u2019m starting to get upset because I realize we didn\\u2019t pack anything. There\\u2019s no food. There\\u2019s no water. I don\\u2019t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don\\u2019t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I\\u2019m sure. I say, \\u201cyes, we don\\u2019t have any of the things we need.\\u201d She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there\\u2019s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we\\u2019re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we\\u2019re heading back the other way. We\\u2019re all fine, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, \\u201c well, we\\u2019re going to take a shortcut.\\u201d And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He\\u2019s young - he\\u2019s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He\\u2019s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There\\u2019s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there\\u2019s display cases and a buffet table. I\\u2019m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don\\u2019t because I\\u2019m allergic to rice and I\\u2019m allergic to soy and I can\\u2019t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I\\u2019m heartbroken because number one, I\\u2019m starving, and number two, I haven\\u2019t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can\\u2019t.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There\\u2019s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She\\u2019s cooking. I\\u2019m trying to load the dishwasher. It\\u2019s a very complicated dishwasher and I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in. She\\u2019s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There\\u2019s enough though. I\\u2019m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I\\u2019m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever\\u2019s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, \\u201cCan you please open this?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy? I don\\u2019t drink.\\u201d Even though it\\u2019s beer, it\\u2019s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are you all drinking?\\u201d We\\u2019re at a gathering, maybe it\\u2019s Christmas or New Year\\u2019s, I don\\u2019t know, but there\\u2019s a celebration happening. Of course, it\\u2019s my family, so they\\u2019re all drinking and I\\u2019m the only one that doesn\\u2019t drink. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhy am I opening this bottle for her?\\u201d I think she\\u2019s trying to give it to me, but I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, here\\u2019s your bottle of beer-wine.\\u201d I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I\\u2019m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird\\u2019s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn\\u2019t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house, it\\u2019s kind of dark. It\\u2019s my mom\\u2019s house, I know that. There was a lot of dream before this, but this is the only part of the dream I can remember. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m there, I\\u2019m just there. My mom is there and I\\u2019m not entirely comfortable. She\\u2019s a younger version of herself - she\\u2019s in her forties, I think. I\\u2019m my age. I\\u2019m in a part of the room with a bed. I\\u2019m sitting on the bed and looking out the window. I can see this gigantic rat; it\\u2019s the size of a racoon. Or maybe it\\u2019s a koala. It\\u2019s like a cross between all three of those animals. It\\u2019s flying from some trees to a spot outside of the house where there is a hole big enough for it to get into. It gets in and crawls into a box across the room from me. I\\u2019m horrified and grossed out because this thing is really big and freaking me out with its long teeth. I\\u2019m not sure why it\\u2019s in the house. It\\u2019s like when you find a mouse in your house and it\\u2019s not your favorite thing in the world to see that you\\u2019re sharing space with the rodents. But this rodent thing is huge. I have this general sense of frustration. I\\u2019m mad that I\\u2019m there. I don't want to be spending time with my mom or be in the same space as her. She\\u2019s not in the room with me now though and not interacting. I\\u2019m just generally upset. Then she does come into the room. She\\u2019s pointing out to me some books that she\\u2019s read. I\\u2019m looking at the books on this dusty-ass bookshelf. The inside of the house is dark and reminds me of an old haunted house, like a Victorian era style with rugs and chandeliers. It\\u2019s darker inside and very dim lighting. These books are written by Loreena McKennitt. This is hilarious because Loreena McKennitt is actually a Canadian singer of Cetlic songs. But in my dream, she has written all these books and my mom is like, \\u201cOh yeah, I remember reading all of these.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at all of them and am like, \\u201cDid I read these?\\u201d I would be surprised if I didn\\u2019t read these because I read almost everything that was fantasy fiction fairy, whatever, and that\\u2019s what definitely these books are about. On the front of the books is art deco artwork of fairies and goddesses and fantasy genre. There is a whole series. I think I\\u2019ve read these and I think if I started reading them, I would remember what they\\u2019re all about. My curiosity is quite peaked. I want to read them. Then my mom goes and gets clothes out of a dryer. But it\\u2019s not clothes, it\\u2019s lame tablecloths, which is funny because in real life, her event planning side of her business she had tons and tons of lame tablecloths for the tables when she would set up parties. So she\\u2019s folding these tablecloths and kind of doing mom things around me. She\\u2019s also showing me clothes that she\\u2019s sewn. Or maybe she\\u2019s wearing them? I look down and see a little girl and it\\u2019s my daughter but also me but also my mom, all three of us together. She\\u2019s wearing a skirt I made and an old thrifted Christmas sweater and another jacket over it. Her entire outfit is so cute. It\\u2019s funky, the colors match\\u2019ish because the skirt I made is black, white and red taffeta plaid with black velvet vines over the top of it. The sweater is like an ugly Christmas sweater you\\u2019d find at a thrift store, but it looks so cute on her. Then she has this red velvet coat over the top. She\\u2019s maybe five. She\\u2019s super cute and I can\\u2019t believe how cute she is with her outfit and how she\\u2019s acting. I\\u2019m wanting to love on her. But she\\u2019s kind of standoffish and not wanting to interact with me. Then I look out the window and see that rat thing. I think I had gotten rid of it. It takes a flying leap back to the house and comes in through its hole. It creeps down the bookcase. I\\u2019m watching it and am like, \\u201cEw, go away!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at my mom and she\\u2019s like shrugging her shoulders like this thing just kind of lives here. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s a huge whatever! It\\u2019s pooping all over the place. It smells and it steals stuff and makes trash. And it\\u2019s freaky looking!\\u201d But then as it creeps closer to me, it morphs into a koala and looks kind of cute. It\\u2019s acting like a dog where it wants to be accepted. It comes really close to me, then drops to the floor and rolls over on its belly like it wants me to pet it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh hell no, I\\u2019m not petting you.\\u201d Then it rolls back over and climbs up to its perch. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cGross, but whatever, it\\u2019s not my house.\\u201d Then my attention goes back to my mom because she\\u2019s still folding the tablecloths. She has shown me the books and now we are having a conversation and talking about the outfit of the cute little girl who has now disappeared. Now I notice that my mom only has one arm! I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHow are you folding those tablecloths and when did you lose an arm?\\u201d It\\u2019s just a stub at the shoulder joint. We are sitting on the floor, leaning against the bookshelf and I\\u2019m asking where her arm went. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you remember?\\u201d And I don\\u2019t. At this point, it becomes less my mom and a completely different character I don\\u2019t even know. She\\u2019s talking about all the kids she had and like, \\u201cRemember when your brothers did this and this and this? I had my arm then.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, but when did you lose your arm?\\u201d So bizarre.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a house. It\\u2019s very cluttered. One of my brothers is with me. All of a sudden there\\u2019s a bunch of tiny little black bugs swarming. They all hatched at once and they\\u2019re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We\\u2019re both like, eww get them off. I\\u2019m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There\\u2019s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It\\u2019s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It\\u2019s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, \\u201cNo, no. Give me that rat. That\\u2019s our friend. That\\u2019s who\\u2019s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There\\u2019s more space between the rat and the cast. While I\\u2019m looking at this rat, part of me is like, \\u201ceww, it\\u2019s a rat,\\u201d and another part of me is like, \\u201cwell, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.\\u201d It\\u2019s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it\\u2019s a rat and it\\u2019s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I\\u2019m in a home. The part of the home I\\u2019m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It\\u2019s a square room with a round table in the center. It\\u2019s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he\\u2019s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he\\u2019s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frustrating, and I\\u2019m not entirely sure what we\\u2019re talking about. Then my ex shows up, or at least his voice does - I don\\u2019t actually see him. He tells me that he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with the kids. In the conversation with my ex father in law it was apparent that I was going to need to stay in the house that I\\u2019m in and I can\\u2019t move anywhere because it\\u2019s my only place of residence. So when my ex tells me he\\u2019s moving to Hawaii with my kids, I\\u2019m pissed because I can\\u2019t get out of this house that I\\u2019m in. I\\u2019m super mad that they\\u2019re all in Hawaii. They\\u2019re not even from there. They\\u2019re just these white people who will just buy land and move there and my kids are going to be there without me to show them what Hawaii really is. I\\u2019m just mad that I\\u2019m stuck in this house. Somehow whatever agreement I\\u2019ve made with my ex father in law is keeping me stuck. Then I\\u2019m pissed at my ex because he just makes decisions about the kids without asking and just does whatever he wants.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a log cabin. It\\u2019s not just a square, it\\u2019s an L-shape. I\\u2019m there with some friends and people I don\\u2019t know. There are about eight people all together. I\\u2019m socializing with and having conversations with the people that I didn't know before I got there amongst what feels like to be an atmosphere of companionship and camaraderie. All of us leave the log cabin and go downtown to have something to eat. It looks like an old-fashioned ice cream parlor with those milkshake machines that are slim and have the metal cups. I scoop the ice cream into the metal cup and pour the milk in, then insert the cup onto the whisk. The cup stays there while the machine shakes the milk with the whisk then you have this cool frosty iced milkshake. While we\\u2019re in there, one of the guys and his friend begin talking to me. I feel an attraction to the guy that\\u2019s talking to me. I know he feels it, too. He reacts as though he does but he tells me that he has to leave in the morning, so he\\u2019s trying to fix me up with his friend who I do not feel any chemistry with. I\\u2019m telling him, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not interested in your friend.\\u201d He\\u2019s trying to convince me and saying, \\u201cBut my friend is a really nice guy and he\\u2019s single.\\u201d I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBe that as it may, I feel nothing more than friends with him, so no.\\u201d The guy I\\u2019m talking to relents. We continue flirting, standing close with a little body contact. I do realize he\\u2019s leaving in the morning. We go back to the cabin. I\\u2019m really sleepy. It\\u2019s like 3:30 in the morning. A couple of my friends are going into the shadowy part of the cabin and I know that\\u2019s where their bed is. They just go to sleep. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to do. I go around the L-shape of the cabin to a bed that\\u2019s kind of tucked in the wall, it\\u2019s part of the design of the cabin. I lie down in one of the beds and close my eyes and go to sleep. But the guy I was flirting with, his friend, and another guy I can\\u2019t see because he\\u2019s in the stem of the L, and somebody who wasn\\u2019t there before and just arrived. I\\u2019m vaguely aware of this but I\\u2019m too tired to get up and I don\\u2019t really care and it\\u2019s 3:30. They\\u2019re all talking to each other and I can hear the low rumbling of their voices. I sleep again. Then when I wake up, I wake up to the sound of male voices and they\\u2019re chanting. The name they\\u2019re chanting is Joe. It\\u2019s like, \\u201cJoe, Joe, Joe Joe,\\u201d like a pub crawl bar room to get somebody to chug their beer. They\\u2019re saying it quietly, but it\\u2019s the feel of the chant and it\\u2019s woken me up. In that instant where I\\u2019m wondering what they\\u2019re doing I realize what they\\u2019re doing. Then I realize that I heard the guy I felt the energy with say in his subconscious: \\u201cMaybe Paige would like it.\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhere did that girl come from?\\u201d Then I remember there was a younger girl in the cabin before I fell asleep. She was about 13 or 14. I\\u2019m thinking her name must be Paige. Out of the corner of my eye I realize that the other guy who also entered at about 3:30 has no pants on. Then my brain puts it together. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cMaybe Paige would like it?\\u201d And they\\u2019re chanting his name. He\\u2019s doing something to her! I get up out of the bed and I see him. He\\u2019s got one hand around the back of her head and the other one on his own cock and he\\u2019s forcing her to give him a blowjob. All this rage! I get out of the bed and am yelling at all of them: \\u201cGet off her!\\u201d I\\u2019m ready to fly at this guy. They all step back. They look shocked. I\\u2019m so angry that I woke myself up and I can\\u2019t get back to sleep. My heart is pounding. I'm furious that they\\u2019re all egging him on and standing around chanting his name.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a neighborhood with a family. Part of the family is a father-son. They\\u2019re Filipino and they\\u2019re acting like all the Filipino men I ever encountered in Hawaii who had crushes on haole women. They\\u2019re flirty and following me around. It\\u2019s been pouring rain. There\\u2019s basically a river of water on the street outside of the house. There\\u2019s a little place where somehow the water isn\\u2019t washing things away, but I can get in up to my neck. I get in with my swimsuit and the dad and his brother or son in their forties are closeby watching me. I\\u2019m swimming in this little pond - it\\u2019s like there\\u2019s a hole in the ground that\\u2019s been filled and somehow it\\u2019s keeping me out of the main rushing river of water. The water is clear right here but as the rain comes and goes, it gets muddy from the rain rushing down the mountains, then it clears out again. I\\u2019m in this water. I\\u2019m comfortable in it and glad I\\u2019m there. Somehow it\\u2019s not too cold even though it\\u2019s rain water. I\\u2019m looking up the road to where the water is coming from. There\\u2019s a mountain so this river water is coming down from the mountain. I\\u2019m watching as the water goes muddy then clear. I\\u2019m getting in and out of this water. I dry off a little bit and go back in as needed. One of the times I get out and dry off, the water has gone and it\\u2019s not raining anymore. So now there isn\\u2019t a place for me to get in the water. I leave and am done here, time to move on. The whole time I was there I had a sense of these two men always flirting with me, always wanting my attention, always wanting something from me. While I was being polite to them, it was very annoying and I just wanted to be in the water and to be talked to like a normal human being not some haole girl that they have a crush on because I\\u2019m white. The scene changes. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people. This is bizarre, I have no idea who they are in real life, but in the dream I knew them from a time before, I had spent a lot of time with them before, as if I was part of their family. Now I\\u2019ve come back from wherever I was and I can\\u2019t even remember everyone\\u2019s names. It\\u2019s so strange. There\\u2019s a bigger white lady and her family and other friends and neighbors from the neighborhood that have created this community. They\\u2019re putting on a CrossFit competition. They\\u2019ve put on competitions and cookouts and other community events with all their own money in the past. It\\u2019s a way for them to keep the community together. It\\u2019s very interesting because they\\u2019ve opened their arms to me the first time I was with them and I don\\u2019t know the reason why I was there. Now I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m with them this second time. I\\u2019m just there asking them questions about how everything\\u2019s going, how they\\u2019re all doing and how the event\\u2019s going. They\\u2019re talking about how putting on this CrossFit competition has been a little more difficult because of the coronavirus. But they\\u2019re still going to do it and see it through because they\\u2019re all family and love each other. It\\u2019s a very strange sense of community but they\\u2019re not particularly intelligent. I also can\\u2019t believe I don\\u2019t remember their names. At some point I go from one of their houses to a vet\\u2019s office. Some of them are working there. I\\u2019m getting echoes of remembering what this office looked like as if I used to work there, too. This whole time part of me is wondering where Josh is because he\\u2019s my \\u201cpeople\\u201d and he\\u2019s my community and he\\u2019s not there. Then he does show up for a little bit and he\\u2019s the only name I can remember and I\\u2019m trying to introduce them and he\\u2019s gone off to talk to people. I\\u2019m still trying to get back to him. Then the dream shifts again and it gets super fantastical. I\\u2019m in a different body, a very strange round being. I\\u2019m the son or daughter of another being that looks exactly like me. We\\u2019re going to a lake. This lake is huge and swampy looking. The water is not very clean, the trees around it are dead and there\\u2019s black moss hanging from things. It\\u2019s very dreary. The sky is a greyish yellowish color. My dad, this other being, is like, \\u201cAlright, son, it\\u2019s time to go out there. Prove that you\\u2019re a man.\\u201d I get into this little round floaty and am paddling out into the lake. He has gone out before me and is like, \\u201cYou have to be very, very quiet so you don\\u2019t wake the monsters.\\u201d We\\u2019re out in the lake and he wants to show me something. We paddle out to this area where it\\u2019s clear enough for me to look down and see. He says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s the lake dog.\\u201d I look down and there\\u2019s literally a pitbull face with a thick, long body like a sausage, super fit and muscular. The butt end of it has a round circular mouth full of huge teeth that would destroy you. It\\u2019s curled up around itself on the bottom of this lake, so it\\u2019s underwater. This dog can breathe underwater. My dad, or whoever this is, says, \\u201cDon't wake it up.\\u201d But we paddle over it and we wake it up. It swims up from the bottom and gets up out of the water and starts barking and making a lot of noise. At this point, I turn to my right and am really freaked out. I\\u2019m looking to see if it\\u2019s going to wake anything up. I see in this copse of dead trees, in the branches, a huge skeleton with a head like a pterodactyl. It\\u2019s body is crazy long, maybe a hundred feet long. It has eight or nine sets of wings, all skeleton. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, that\\u2019s the size of the monsters around here! We need to leave now and stop bothering the lake dog.\\u201d Somehow the lake dog is pacified and we start paddling back to the lakeshore.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a room gathering supplies. It\\u2019s clothing and shoes which all look the same and are necessary for a dance routine that will be performed. I\\u2019m wearing black low heeled booties and leggings and a tight top with a cowl neck. My clothing seems important because it\\u2019s part of the show I\\u2019m going to put on, or I need to wear as the teacher who is going to be teaching others the dance moves of this show we are going to put on. Then I go out from this room - I guess it\\u2019s like a costume closet - and I\\u2019m carrying all the pieces of clothing that others need. I\\u2019m walking down a hall and I walk into my old cafeteria from grade school. Everyone is there to learn this dance. I set all the clothes out and the people who need them grab what they need. I stand back and watch as an older Latina woman with dark hair tied up in a bun shows everyone the dance moves they need to know. They\\u2019re kind of jerky, like robot type, but she teaches them all. Everybody starts doing this dance synchronized together. I\\u2019m watching. I\\u2019m not part of this thing. The whole dance seems a little bit off. I look back to the pile of clothes and it\\u2019s changed into different items than I gave out. It\\u2019s a bunch of grey athletic pants and there are what I first think to be sports bras, but are women\\u2019s underwear - super strappy like 10 straps on each side where the hips would be. They remind me a lot of pole dancing shorts. The pile is a mess now - instead of being piled neatly, it\\u2019s all over the place. I look back and everybody is in fact wearing a black top and these grey athletic pants. Initially I had brought out more shoes like the ones I was wearing, but they aren\\u2019t what people actually put on. Then that completes - the teacher finishes teaching the dance and they do it. There\\u2019s never a show, but there is a sense of accomplishment like something got finished. People start filing out of this old cafeteria. It morphs a little because the area I\\u2019m standing in suddenly is a larger lobby type area and my super comfy bed is in it. I\\u2019m exhausted, so while there are a few people still milling about, I get in my bed and fall asleep. Now I have no clothes on at all and I\\u2019m trying to sleep naked. I can feel how comfortable my bed is and how tired I am. In my head, I\\u2019m thinking how grateful I am that I have a bed. I feel someone come behind me and can hear people talking, sort of murmuring. I\\u2019m not exactly clear what they\\u2019re saying. But this person snuggles up to spoon behind me and all of a sudden my body is super tense because I have no idea who that is and I\\u2019m not wearing any clothing. I continue to hear talking but I don\\u2019t know what anyone is saying. When I look down at the arm around my waist, it\\u2019s this old arm with liver spots on the hand and the skin is hanging off. I can feel the bile in my throat start to rise. Then all of a sudden, I feel the traditional Sunday morning dick in the back and I\\u2019m a little peeved. I turn around and look and it\\u2019s this old, old man. It\\u2019s him and his friend who have crawled into bed. They also just want to sleep, but they are not realizing that 1, it\\u2019s my bed, and 2, I don\\u2019t have clothes and 3, it\\u2019s so inappropriate for them to be poking me. So I turn around and I start yelling at them to get out. They\\u2019re a little embarrassed but there\\u2019s also this vibe of lecherousness. I\\u2019m so mad and I kick them out. Then I get out of bed and put my clothes on. There were actually people around watching this go down. I\\u2019m pissed. I\\u2019m so mad that they would even dare to encroach on my space or that somebody else would encourage them to do so. Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m in a lobby of a Crossfit gym. A friend of mine is there and it\\u2019s the same friend from the dream two nights ago. I\\u2019m happy to see her and she\\u2019s happy to see me as well. But then she starts talking and asks me, who do I think I am to come back into her life and pretence like nothing ever happened, and for me to influence people around her to see her in a different way. And who do I think I am to think that her friends would be so forgiving of me and welcoming me back into the crowd. I\\u2019m really shocked hearing her say this, because she absolutely on one hand said she missed me and wanted to try to repair and fix the friendship, and on the other hand is completely berating me. I\\u2019m so confused and definitely hurt. I can feel myself backing away, trying to get out and away of this entire situation, taking the hint that she\\u2019s not interested and I need to leave.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a shower stall with Ana. I can\\u2019t remember if our clothes are on or off. We\\u2019re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I\\u2019m looking at her like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re just kind of winging it.\\u201d I wish I could remember more, but there\\u2019s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with my siblings. We\\u2019re all in a big house together and it\\u2019s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We\\u2019re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it\\u2019s just covered in blueberries. We\\u2019re munching on them. We\\u2019re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he\\u2019s not a very smooth driver. So I\\u2019m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he\\u2019s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it\\u2019s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We\\u2019re in a house of some sort but I don\\u2019t recognize it and I don\\u2019t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we\\u2019re all gathered for a wedding. I\\u2019m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he\\u2019s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there\\u2019s no bowl and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cHey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.\\u201d The popcorn starts popping and it\\u2019s endless. I\\u2019m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it\\u2019s going everywhere. It wouldn\\u2019t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I\\u2019m looking down and thinking you can\\u2019t even save this. He\\u2019s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, \\u201cnice way to go, dad,\\u201d and I think my dad is standing there like, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s not a good way to pop popcorn.\\u201d As he\\u2019s sweeping up the popcorn, there\\u2019s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There\\u2019s tons of it and it\\u2019s all over the floor. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don't know what you\\u2019re going to do with all of this. You\\u2019re going to have to throw it away.\\u201d He says, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll make more.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWell the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.\\u201d It feels like a waste. There was more to this dream, but I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in a train station and I\\u2019m looking at the boards that announce arrivals and departures and finding my train to get on. It\\u2019s an Amtrak train. I find the train I want. I get on through a gate that reminds of an airport, the way it\\u2019s set up to get on and off. I find my gate and I get on. I take a seat and the train starts to leave. It\\u2019s just me. I have a few bags with me. I\\u2019m watching as the train leaves the station. It never really goes outside. I think the train is in a tunnel the whole time, so it seems dark. There\\u2019s multiple stops and there\\u2019s some stops I need to get off of, but then I get back on the train. I get off and then I get back on. Now I\\u2019ve gotten off at this one particular spot and my kids are with me - I think I was picking them up. We don\\u2019t get back on the train at this same stop. We all get together and we go to a friend\\u2019s house and the friend's house is tiny. It\\u2019s in a more run down part of town. We\\u2019re there and her kids are there. The kids are all playing together and we\\u2019re talking. She\\u2019s telling me about how she\\u2019s ended a couple of habits she didn\\u2019t like. She stopped doing things the way she had been doing it and now she\\u2019s cleaning her house. Things look less cluttered in her space and she clearly felt better about all of it. Then I realize it\\u2019s time for us to go. It\\u2019s time for the kids to get back on the train. Before we go, another woman shows up. It\\u2019s a different friend who reminds me of my old hula teacher. She\\u2019s giving me some advice about how to parent because my daughter is definitely talking back and is resisting us getting on the train. I lose my temper in front of everyone and my daughter gets really pissed off and stomps off. Then both my friends are telling me how I could do it differently with her. I take their advice and I grab both my kids. We leave the house and head back to get on this train. It\\u2019s so important but I have no idea where we're going and I don\\u2019t know why. The sun has set now. It\\u2019s dark and we\\u2019re walking through a part of town that looks a little bit shady and it\\u2019s like a city and I have a death grip on both my kids\\u2019 hands because I don\\u2019t want anybody to snag them. Both my kids have their luggage, but I have this feeling that something is going to happen to the kids and I\\u2019m really worried. So we\\u2019re now rushing to get on this train. I\\u2019m looking at my phone - my phone is a map showing me where the terminals are for us to get on the train. But for some reason, the map in my hand is not syncing up with where we actually are. At one point, we walk into this nightclub and it\\u2019s full dark now. I don\\u2019t know how we walk into a nightclub with two udnerage kids, but we walk in there and we\\u2019re walking towards the back, looking for the train terminal for the entrance. I still can\\u2019t find it and I walk past the bartender and a bouncer and they both tell me that there\\u2019s no train in there. In the meantime, I have both my kids and it\\u2019s definitely not a place for minors. So I have this death grip on their hands and I\\u2019m pulling them back out of the nightclub, but somehow there\\u2019s a ring on my left finger that gets caught on the necklace of the bouncer who\\u2019s trying to help us out, telling us there isn\\u2019t a station there. It takes a minute for it to get untangled, although he does help me. Then I grab my kids hands again and we\\u2019re heading up the sidewalk trying to find another train station to get on these trains. My daughter doesn\\u2019t want to go and I\\u2019m having a hard time keeping her with me, but I\\u2019m so terrified that something\\u2019s going to happen to her because it\\u2019s dark out, it\\u2019s not a good part of the city, there\\u2019s people everywhere, she\\u2019s young - she\\u2019s only 12. My son is very happy to stay close by, but she wants to go off and explore and I\\u2019m not having it. She\\u2019s still pissed at me for whatever altercation we had at the friend\\u2019s house. So eventually I find a bike. We get on the bike - somehow I manage to get all three of us on with our luggage. I figure we\\u2019ll find the train wherever it is on its rails and get on that way. We\\u2019re on the bike. We\\u2019re riding through the streets and there\\u2019s snow up to my mid-calves and the snow is slushy. We\\u2019re still riding through it on the bike but of course it\\u2019s not safe. We\\u2019re riding with a lot of cars. I don\\u2019t feel safe with the cars because they could take us out any minute. We ride down this one hill into what seems to be much more like the ghettos. There\\u2019s tank drums and somebody\\u2019s got a fire in the drum. I\\u2019ve got the kids with me and I really don\\u2019t feel safe now. I see the train is actually in front of us at this intersection. There\\u2019s also a friend I know. He and his mom are in front of us and there\\u2019s also a train parked in front of us on some tracks through the intersection. I\\u2019m really wanting us to get on this train. We never make it on. I ask the friend and his mom for help, but they kind of ignore me and I\\u2019m stuck with my two kiddos, with no way to get on the train in this part of town that does not feel safe, on a bicycle in the snow. The dream ends there.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in Hawaii by a lake, My parents and sister are nearby. I look down at the brown wet leaves at my feet. I see two snakes intertwined with each other. Then I\\u2019m shocked and worried because there aren\\u2019t supposed to be any snakes in Hawaii. I also know that Hawaii doesn\\u2019t have lakes, so I\\u2019m a bit confused, too. As I\\u2019m watching the snakes, I realize they\\u2019re mating and this is even worse because instead of just two snakes, there will be more and the island could be taken over by snakes. I look into the water and see another snake swimming in the water. As I watch, I realize it\\u2019s a huge anaconda and it\\u2019s undulating towards my mom, dad and sister. I yell at my parents and sister to warn them. I realize that I have to do something about this and find someone who can help me. Now I look at the ground again. The first two snakes are also anacondas - a lot larger than I first thought. There are also so many bathing snakes writhing around like earthworms, but they\\u2019re actually itty bitty baby snakes. I\\u2019m trying to cut them with a shovel. I can squash them with my shoes because I\\u2019m wearing flip flops and those won\\u2019t do. I\\u2019m looking for help and now realize that the snakes are a problem all over the island. I\\u2019m now at a hotel looking for more snakes and help. It\\u2019s late. I see Ted. We sit on a curb away from everyone else and have a talk before returning to our separate hotel rooms for the night.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the back of a house/laboratory and they\\u2019re showing me the pool. It\\u2019s rounded and smooth at the bottom. People are swimming in the water, breathing with eyes open and taking pictures from under the water. It\\u2019s a scientific experiment. But as they swim, they are disturbing the water and it is sloshing with water from other pools that are contaminated. In the front of the house, someone is lighting candles on the altar, so many candles all clustered together.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the kitchen of a communal home. It\\u2019s an old house. There are big books set up on the counter - they look like spell books or history books. Pema brings a bread book into the kitchen and sets it up.\"],[\"I\\u2019m in the room of a house I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m there with, I think my ex, I\\u2019m not sure as the face flickers out. But I\\u2019m looking around and there\\u2019s a table, a desk, with an old stereo on it - it looks exactly like the one I had growing up in high school. It has a case and the case is not on it, so I put the case on like it\\u2019s supposed to be. There\\u2019s also a vase of flowers in the room - I don\\u2019t know if somebody gave them to me, or if they\\u2019re just there. I put them next to the bed on this tall nightstand. This whole time I feel simultaneously trapped and nostalgic. This old radio stereo makes me nostalgic for my childhood and yet I feel trapped in this room and want to get out of it, especially since it looks like my ex is in there with me. Then he says we have to go to dinner. I don\\u2019t want to because we\\u2019re not together and I have no idea why I\\u2019d go to dinner with him. But he says we have to go because we\\u2019re meeting clients of his. Now I\\u2019m really not wanting to because it\\u2019s a gross schmoozy dinner that I do not want to be a part of. He walks out the door and gets on a bike and starts pedaling through a crowd. I\\u2019ve followed him out and am watching him go. I\\u2019m really sad because I know that my legs and the muscles in my body are not as strong as they used to be and it\\u2019s going to be really hard for me to pedal that bike to follow him to this dinner party we\\u2019re going to. I can just feel how I don\\u2019t have very much strength in my legs and I used to have a lot. And it's making me really sad to know that I used to be a very strong bodied person and now I\\u2019m not. I follow him anyway on a bike. I stay behind him the whole way because I can\\u2019t keep up. We\\u2019re biking through crowds of people to get to this restaurant. I\\u2019m following along behind and he parks his bike and so do I. I see him talking to a host at the restaurant and telling him he has a table for four and I\\u2019m to follow. So I follow him to a table, but there\\u2019s enough distance between us that by the time I finally get to the table, he\\u2019s already ordered drinks and he has hor d'oeuvres coming and he\\u2019s on his second drink already. I go to sit down at the table, still very reluctant. There are other people who will join us. He has me try one of his drinks. It\\u2019s alcoholic and super sugary sweet gross, and I don\\u2019t want to taste it because I know alcohol is so bad for me - it will make me feel really badly really quickly and I hate that I\\u2019m here with him. It feels like I\\u2019m being made to perform the dutiful hostess while he performs the gross role of extravagant host. He\\u2019s ordering all the food and our guests are here now. It\\u2019s two different couples, both man and wife, female and male couples. They\\u2019ve sat down and my ex is getting loud and really arrogant and ordering the food for everyone. He\\u2019s ordering tapas for everyone but it has dairy or grain, which is all food I\\u2019m allergic to, so there's nothing for me to eat or drink. I\\u2019m trying to make small talk with these friends of his. The men are also gross and arrogant and the wives are too, but the one next to me is a little more subdued in her behavior and demeanor. She\\u2019s not loud and laughing. She\\u2019s more quiet and we are sitting next to each other. I feel a little connection with her, although at one point someone spills a cocktail all over both of us and it\\u2019s sticky and she\\u2019s laughing but I\\u2019m annoyed. Then somehow the dinner is over and the scene changes because now I'm off by myself. I\\u2019m really grateful to be by myself. I\\u2019m walking up through these hills and I can still see the restaurant I had been in, which is on a pier. I have an impression of the ocean that was part of the background of this restaurant. But now I\\u2019m walking through these smaller rolling hills - they\\u2019re all green. There are copses of trees and when I look up the hill, it\\u2019s thickly covered in forest, but I\\u2019m not in that thicker part yet. There\\u2019s a fire somewhere and now I\\u2019m following these men who are firefighters - they\\u2019re very burly, muscular and thick - cliche of a firefighter. I\\u2019m on stealth mode for some reason. I know I have to get to this fire to see what\\u2019s going on, but I don\\u2019t want to get in the way of the firefighters. So I'm following them, but being very sneaky and hiding behind some of the trees as I follow them to this road. I can hear dispatch giving them instructions to the road of how to get to the fire. I\\u2019m following along but sneaking behind everyone, though I can see everything playing out in front of me. Then I get to this place where I\\u2019m looking at the road and I can see the fire engines. It\\u2019s a dirt road, but there are houses along it. They are driving through neighborhoods, but where I\\u2019m standing, there\\u2019s a souvenir store like what you'd see at Disneyland to pick up Disneyland stuff. I\\u2019m not entirely sure what the souvenirs are, but it has that feel of a place where tourists come to spend money. I\\u2019m in this store but still watching what\\u2019s happening outside as the firefighters are heading towards this fire. All of a sudden, there is an assassination and I\\u2019m watching the person who is supposed to be doing the assassinating. I\\u2019m not entirely sure who he\\u2019s supposed to kill, but this person is an elf and has a silver bow that he\\u2019s going to do the assasination with. I\\u2019m watching him weave through the crowd and hide behind some of the displays in the shop. He finally gets his eyes on the person he\\u2019s going to assassinate. He puts his silver bow down next to him and it starts sliding away. All of a sudden the aisles in this store mimic the hills I\\u2019ve been walking on. This bow starts to slide away from him and somebody notices it and says, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you\\u2019re going to kill your target if your bow is sliding away.\\u201d He looks up and realizes that somebody else has been tracking him as he\\u2019s been tracking his target, and I\\u2019ve been watching all of this go on. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s a commotion outside the store. The woman who had been sitting next to me at dinner is being attacked by someone - whether it is the assassin's target or not, I\\u2019m not sure, but I see her pulled behind the side of the building and then there\\u2019s screaming. I\\u2019m really worried at this point because it doesn\\u2019t seem like anyone is going to stop them, except maybe this assassin in front of me with his bow sliding away down the hill. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m looking down at a pool or lake. My son is in the middle of it, floating with his head up out of the water. I panic a little because I\\u2019m not sure how long he can keep swimming by himself and I\\u2019m quite far away. As I watch he starts to swim to the far side of the lake to where waves are crashing against the shore. He gets caught in the waves and his body is being thrown around. I rush to him. I\\u2019m not sure if I get to him in time.\"],[\"I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s about Coronavirus, but the huge concerns for my family and my loving dog which I hope they are with me in contry area, i wake up thought I\\u2019m with them. I miss my city and family a lot.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a piece of property with two houses. There\\u2019s a main house and a secondary building that is smaller and looks like a single-wide, slanted with one side taller than the other. The taller side of this building is all sliding glass windows and you can see into it. The land has eucalyptus trees and a mango tree. It looks kind of tropical but also like California, desert with a lot of oak trees. I\\u2019m with my family - my dad, mom and siblings - and other people who I don\\u2019t recognize, but have the sense they are ancestors. It\\u2019s a gathering. The focus is on this little house with all the sliding doors and glass windows. I can see into it and there are Persian rugs all over and couches. The other house is a grand house that\\u2019s very well appointed, while this house is more humble with a small kitchen off to the left and a bath. I don\\u2019t see any beds, but my dad is telling me that he and friends have stayed there and really liked sleeping there. I can see a fireplace. But I have no idea where they sleep. I see a dining room table and chairs and a couple couches, but again, no beds. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere are you all sleeping? There are no beds and no place to sleep.\\u201d This house is definitely a focus for the moment. Parts of it need fixing up. It doesn\\u2019t have plumbing and they\\u2019re planning on putting plumbing in it. Me and my dad and at least a few other people are gathered around the house and looking at it and talking about it. Then, the scene changes. I\\u2019m with somebody who looks like a young Keanu Reeves and he\\u2019s hurt. He had some sort of accident and is learning to walk again. I\\u2019m watching him getting rehab in the pool with his mom and sister - I have no idea if he has a mom and sister in real life. I\\u2019m watching them encourage him to do his pool exercises of swimming and water jogging so that he regains the full use of his body and legs. He does. At first he starts out really bitter and sullen, but then his demeanor changes as he spends time in the pool. I\\u2019m in the pool with them and I can see him do his exercises. They\\u2019re at one end of the pool and he\\u2019s swimming back and forth to the wall. He reminds me of my brother, too - it\\u2019s like he\\u2019s switching back and forth. He regains full use of his body and gets out of the pool. Then the Rock shows up. I\\u2019m following along with all of this, but can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m actually in the dream or just observing. They climb into a helicopter. There\\u2019s one other person who shows up, but I can\\u2019t remember who it is, although it\\u2019s some movie star. They climb into the helicopter and I\\u2019m afraid that the helicopter isn\\u2019t balanced and if we all get in, it\\u2019s going to tip backwards and fall off the ledge it\\u2019s perched on. The helicopter is all black on the outside. There\\u2019s also a dog. The Rock is the pilot. Keanu Reeves is in the helicopter and ready for an action adventure mission. Then the third person has also climbed in. My fear is that they\\u2019re going to tip over backwards because the helicopter is sitting on a ledge - it\\u2019s not on a super stable helipad. I\\u2019ve followed them into the cockpit but don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m really there because I don\\u2019t have a place to sit and no one is addressing me. They\\u2019re all healthy and ready to go. I\\u2019m hearing mission kind of music playing in my head, so it\\u2019s really like a movie. They\\u2019re going to take off. I think I go with them, but I can\\u2019t remember. Below us is a bunch of water - it\\u2019s like a cliff face with rocks and ocean down below.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a quest and there are a lot of different characters on this quest. I am being escorted by my dad. He\\u2019s the male figure who is with me. There\\u2019s also another part of the party - a child, a younger person, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is. We\\u2019re headed out into what looks like a rather desolate lava field. But before we go, I am with a gypsy woman. I have met with this gypsy woman and we are in her caravan. It\\u2019s a cross between an old fashioned caravan drawn by a pair of horses but also an RV. It\\u2019s awesome. On the inside, it\\u2019s set up the way an RV is set up - you can see through the front windows where the driver\\u2019s seat is, but it\\u2019s still very witchy on the inside. This gypsy woman travels around but doesn\\u2019t necessarily look like a regular gypsy with scarves and whatnot. She is dressed in long robes and has longer hair. She has jewelry and there\\u2019s something about the jewelry - it\\u2019s earrings. I\\u2019m on a quest, but there\\u2019s two, so the first one I go on, I have a particular pair of earrings I pick out from her and I wear them. They\\u2019re a talisman of some sort. They are either protective or hold magic powers that enhance my own. I\\u2019m not entirely sure. I wear these out on this quest and I go out. I don\\u2019t remember the details of it, but I come back into the van. It\\u2019s time for me to continue on the quest, but it\\u2019s a level up now. I\\u2019ve realized this time around that the earrings are really important and I need a good pair for what I\\u2019m going to do. I\\u2019m going through what she has and there\\u2019s this pair that is just stunning. One earring is pearls with long chains and other gems on the bottom. The other earring that\\u2019s part of this pair is a huge chandelier earring which reaches past my breast. It\\u2019s really long. I put them both on and I can feel myself all of a sudden level up, like you would in a video game. She is trying to tell me what the different properties of these earrings are based on the different stones and what\\u2019s in them and what they will allow me to do. So my dad or whoever it - the male figure - is in the background, he\\u2019s still with me. He just is kind of there - he was just kind of there on the first quest and he\\u2019s just kind of there on the second quest. He does make a few suggestions about how to go about doing things, but he\\u2019s definitely taking a backseat. This is all up to me. The gypsy woman and I are conversing about the powers of the earrings, but also my own magical powers that will help me out during this section part of the quest. Then the scene changes from this questing to me being in what seems like a village. It kind of reminds me of the villages you visit in Disneyland. They\\u2019re a little bit fake but they\\u2019re kind of neat because there\\u2019s cool stuff in them. This village is smallish and there is an appearance of all my high school classmates and other people I don't know who are just filling in the spaces. I\\u2019m watching as one of my high school friends - someone who\\u2019s in an older class is building a structure out of logs. It\\u2019s an art piece in the center of the town. The rest of us are coming to gather around. There\\u2019s lots of coming and going and I see him build this. I leave and I go do something else. The structure is up and I see people come and have little meetings around this structure. I\\u2019m in a pool and it\\u2019s an indoor pool entirely enclosed in glass. It\\u2019s gorgeous. I\\u2019m there watching people come and go. There\\u2019s meetings happening. My mom has shown up and I hear her having a meeting with some of my classmates. This is very interesting because one of my classmates is having a tantrum and he\\u2019s screaming and crying just like a little kid would. I can't even see him, but I know who it is by his voice. But I don\\u2019t know what my mom is saying and I don\\u2019t know what the meeting is about. In some way she is this boss or it feels like she\\u2019s some sort of crime lord and my classmates are coming and going and doing her bidding, essentially. I\\u2019m shocked to hear my classmate screaming and crying because it seems like such childish behavior. But my mom is not phased by it at all. I can\\u2019t actually see any of this. I can only hear it and feel what\\u2019s going on. I do not have vision of what this is - they are not in my eyesight. I\\u2019m still in this pool/atrium place and their meeting is somewhere above me - like there\\u2019s rooms upstairs above me. I\\u2019ve stepped out of the atrium and it\\u2019s towards my back. Another classmate has her coffee in hand. It looks like she\\u2019s just woken up and she's in her pajamas. She stomps towards that art piece that the other classmate had made and she just pulls the logs down, yelling. I don\\u2019t even know what she\\u2019s yelling about, but she\\u2019s making the assumption that one of our classmates had made the artpiece. When we tell her that it was actually an upperclassman, she gets a little bit freaked out, but it\\u2019s too late. She can\\u2019t fix the sculpture. It\\u2019s already been pulled down. Throughout this whole time, I am part of this scene - I am part of the village, I am part of what's going on, but I\\u2019m also not. I\\u2019m also the observer and again the outcast, not really included, but also supposed to observe what's going on. Then my alarm went off, so I don\\u2019t remember the rest of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a raft with Mia in the middle of an ocean. Mia made the raft. Part of it is made of plastic buckets tied tightly together. The other part is made of logs also tied tightly together with ropes. There\\u2019s a gap between these two parts. Mia and I are on the logs. The ocean is pretty choppy. My husband is nearby on a surfboard. Every now and again a huge shark goes by and it\\u2019s making me feel unsettled and frightened. A huge shark goes right under our raft and makes the waves even choppier right around us. Then another huge shark goes right over our raft and slips between the gap between the buckets and logs. I see that it\\u2019s bloodied and has a rope tied tightly around its fins. Mia doesn\\u2019t seem concerned because even though these sharks are huge, they won\\u2019t directly attack us. But then we are actually under attack. Great Whites spot us. Mia says, \\u201cOkay Viviane, we\\u2019ve gotta dive.\\u201d So we lay flat on our stomachs and make the raft plunge down under the waves as you would do with a surfboard. We plunge away from the shark and miss it. But as we rise up, the tip of our raft knocks the underbelly of a huge hammerhead shark. We have to dive again before surfacing and continue diving deep. I hope we don\\u2019t run out of air and I hope this tactic protects us from the sharks. My husband is doing the same thing on his surfboard. Somehow we all make it safely out of the water to the station. The station is where they provide gear and simple food and coffee/tea. They also collect stories from people\\u2019s time out in the water. A guy is telling us this. Mia begins explaining our story. My husband chimes in, too.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a ship, a huge cruise ship. There are tons of people on it. There's water everywhere. I\\u2019m with a bunch of friends, some from high school and some from now. I see one friend from high school who I haven\\u2019t seen or thought about in a while. He is sitting across this really big table from me. All of a sudden I see him lift his hand and I can feel this force coming from his hand and he\\u2019s pushing against me. This whole time we were talking about some of things I can do, and he said, \\u201cOh yeah, watch this. Can you do this?\\u201d I feel a force or pressure from his hand as if someone is pushing on me. It\\u2019s not malicious or anything; he\\u2019s just trying to show me what he can do. I\\u2019m shocked because I can\\u2019t do it and I feel a little embarrassed that I should be able to do this but I can\\u2019t. Then he goes: \\u201cOkay now, watch this.\\u201d There\\u2019s a billboard that comes up across and squares and diamonds start appearing at the top and he\\u2019s making this happen. In the dream, I have this recognition that I haven\\u2019t seen him in a long time and he went somewhere then came back and can do all this cool stuff. Then the dream shifts. We\\u2019re on land now. I\\u2019m trying to do a dance with friends - I\\u2019m supposed to be learning this dance. I just can\\u2019t learn it. I\\u2019m behind on my timing. I keep looking out of the corner of my eye to this woman to watch her. My friends Shiena and Teresa who I knew from middle school and high school are there. I think I\\u2019m trying to watch and follow them. My friend Josh is watching me and I feel embarrassed that he\\u2019s watching me and I can\\u2019t get the dance moves. I\\u2019m on big loose rocks and I\\u2019m having a hard time balancing. I feel like he\\u2019s judging me for not being able to balance and not being able to get the dance moves down. Then the scene switches. In the back of my mind I know that there is a mission we\\u2019re going on. We\\u2019re still on land. We\\u2019re sitting on a huge fallen log. We\\u2019re all getting our assignments for what we\\u2019re supposed to do. We\\u2019re each getting assigned a bag to carry. These bags have supplies and whatnot. I\\u2019m watching the person in charge. They have a big clipboard and they\\u2019re assigning some of the newbies (people I don't know at all) sleeping gear. One of the bags has a sleeping bag in it, but they\\u2019ve also put rocks in it to make it extra heavy. Everyone is giggling and laughing because it\\u2019s a joke. I think I\\u2019m supposed to play along with this joke and laugh hahaha, but I don\\u2019t. There is a sense of peer pressure that I need to laugh about it. I\\u2019m a little confused about this whole thing. I\\u2019m not even sure where we\\u2019re supposed to be going. At one point my mom shows up and says, \\u201cOkay, you\\u2019re on this mission and you've got to do these things.\\u201d Other people are telling me all these things I\\u2019m supposed to be doing as my role in this mission. I feel unprepared and don\\u2019t have the skills that other people can do.\"],[\"I\\u2019m on a winding road with my mom and others. We have artwork in the car that we\\u2019re carrying with us as we look for land. We find the land owned by a woman who collects art. We bring down one piece from my mom. The land is huge with big statues and canvases stacked everywhere and leaning against old buildings. There are impressions on the ground where other statues used to be. We think maybe she has decided to move and is selling her art. We wonder if this is a place for us to live. We go to the house. It\\u2019s an old barnhouse. We knock on the door and no one answers so we knock louder. She comes to the door and is wrapped in this white cream robe. Her hair is frizzy. She\\u2019s curious about my mom\\u2019s art piece but turns to me and asks about mine. I say, \\u201cWell I have something I was taking to the dump.\\u201d I run back up the hill to the car and get it. It\\u2019s an old antique picture of a blue heron with an upcycled frame with nails and staples. It\\u2019s bigger than me. This is what she wants. She takes it and leans it against the barn wall. It occurs to us that she\\u2019s staying here and people have just recently been here to buy some of her larger pieces of art.\"],[\"I\\u2019m out on the ocean on a raft or a floating device of some sort. I\\u2019m with this man who is an actor in a show called \\u201cThe Great\\u201d and he plays the Emperor Peter III of Russia and he\\u2019s nutty in the show. The character he plays is tyrannical and pretty uneven. I\\u2019m with him and other people. We\\u2019re floating and there\\u2019s a toy on top of the raft with us, too. It\\u2019s a little wooden truck with blocks in it and the blocks have numbers and the ABC\\u2019s on all their sides. I\\u2019m trying to keep the toy from falling inthe water and disappearing. I don\\u2019t know what we\\u2019re doing or saying, I just know we\\u2019re riding waves. It seems as if this guy, the actor, is a little bit crazy. I\\u2019m trying my best to placate him and do what\\u2019s needed to keep us from drowning and keep the toy from falling off. In my mind I know this toy is a rental, I\\u2019ve borrowed it and have to give it back. We head back to land, catching waves on this raft. The toy gets lost at some point, it falls off into the ocean. The guy says, \\u201cOh no, you\\u2019ve lost your toy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cYeah, but we have to turn it back in because it\\u2019s a rental.\\u201d He tries to help me find it. We find a bunch of toys but it\\u2019s not the one we had. Eventually we do find it and I turn it into this woman. The dream switches. I\\u2019m with all the ladies I have council with. We\\u2019re at a home, I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s home it is. There are a bunch of cars on the lawn next to us and in the driveway of the home that we\\u2019re in. there seems to be cars everywhere, like maybe there\\u2019s a party next door. There are a bunch of cars that are our cars, too. If you go inside the house, it\\u2019s dark and dingy. A tv is playing and the furniture is gross. But we\\u2019re outside mostly on a picnic table. We\\u2019re planting plants into pots, at least I think that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re there to do. We\\u2019re there to make wreaths and plant plants. One of the sisters, Beth, comes and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, we\\u2019re going to do this but first we have to do our makeup.\\u201d It turns into a makeover situation and she has eyeliner and eyeshadow and I think eyelashes. She keeps handing them to Aila, who is in council with us. Aila is the one putting eyeliner on me and it\\u2019s a forest green color. Beth keeps saying, \\u201cTrust me, you\\u2019re going to look gorgeous.\\u201d And Aila is like, \\u201cYup, I\\u2019ve got this.\\u201d She\\u2019s putting it on but I can\\u2019t see and there\\u2019s no mirror so I\\u2019m just trusting them. Aila goes to put on the fake eyelashes and she puts one on right over the bridge of my nose like a joke. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s supposed to be there.\\u201d Everyone is kind of laughing. There are other ladies who are part of the group but not necessarily part of council and they have this bright shimmery turquoise blue eyeshadow on because they were getting their makeup done, too. Somebody says they\\u2019re hungry. I go to make a phone call to order pizza. I\\u2019ve ordered pizza before at other gatherings so that\\u2019s why I volunteer. The pizza guy comes and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you know this but because you\\u2019re new, you get ten free pizzas. So this is your second pizza and you can order eight more pizzas.\\u201d I\\u2019m surprised because I don\\u2019t eat pizza and I'm also surprised that a pizza place would give away pizza for free and that they would drive it out to us. I thank him and take the pizza for everyone to eat. I\\u2019m not going to eat it though because I don\\u2019t eat pizza. It\\u2019s weird. In the meantime, the house next door gets more and more cars parked on its lawn and there are more and more people partying over there. It seems kind of loud. I\\u2019m a little bit trying to distance myself from next door and go inside with this pizza. Inside is still so dingy and gross and I don\\u2019t really want to be in there. Someone says, \\u201cHey look at this.\\u201d She shows me this instagram post where my daughter is doing a video and I\\u2019m horrified because she\\u2019s young and I don\\u2019t want her to have social media. She\\u2019s asking for money and is becoming a little business person on instagram. It\\u2019s a family friend who is a little erratic and is coaching her in how to do it. I\\u2019m freaked out. I start to think that my daughter is doing something that is not age appropriate but she doesn\\u2019t have any idea in her head that she can\\u2019t make money because she\\u2019s a girl or she\\u2019s young or she doesn\\u2019t have an education. She\\u2019s just doing it and making the money.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outside a yoga studio in a common room. I\\u2019m looking through windows. It\\u2019s dark inside the studio. I\\u2019m talking with a yoga teacher I know about how the studio has closed and won't be offering classes again. They are selling everything. She is talking with me about teaching for her. But then I see her talking with a man who is a new yoga teacher but has been in the fitness world for a long time. I don\\u2019t recognize him. She\\u2019s wanting him to pick up some classes, too. I\\u2019m not happy about this. There are tall fake trees in the studio and these are for sale, too, because they have to sell everything.\"],[\"I\\u2019m outside. It\\u2019s twilight. There\\u2019s a gathering of some sort. We\\u2019re going to put on an outdoor show and we need a stage pole. It\\u2019s me and a bunch of others, I\\u2019m not sure who. We\\u2019re trying to put the stage pole together. It\\u2019s like a telescope with a thin end and opens up and out. The pole is like that but reversed - the base is thick and it gets skinnier at the top. It\\u2019s black and made of plastic. I\\u2019m thinking that there\\u2019s no way any of us will be able to pole on this thing. It doesn\\u2019t make any sense. A bunch of us are trying to figure out how to make this work. I think I can hear the ocean somewhere because I can hear waves. The show is for someone, but I don't know who. We\\u2019re having such a difficult time setting up the stage and pole. The pole is so flimsy.\"],[\"I\\u2019m part of a TV show that goes to people\\u2019s homes and surprises them and cleans their cars or helps them out with their food trucks. We are going to this house that we\\u2019ve been to before. It\\u2019s an old African American couple. He is at the food truck cooking the sausage. He\\u2019s really happy to see us. He and his wife have gotten really busy since we were last there. He is nearly done with his shift and we stay outside to surprise her. He goes inside the house and she is cleaning up the house. I\\u2019m standing in the doorway and she sees me and is like, \\u201cOh you\\u2019re the girl from the food show!\\u201d She\\u2019s happy to see us. We need to move things around in the house and clean up and reorganize because we\\u2019ve hired a group of people to professionally clean and paint the trucks to get them ready. They\\u2019re going to pull the truck in through the garage and into the living room. We\\u2019re moving things around, reorganizing the little tables. Then I go outside and the cleaning people come in their van. A woman gets out and she is in a black and tan bikini. She\\u2019s wet, cold and miserable. We\\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the work into the sun so she isn\\u2019t in the cold shade. Then I get them set up and go to the garage. There\\u2019s a big shiny black fancy RV driven by ninjas. A ninja is swinging from a trapeze bar in the trees. It\\u2019s an advertisement to invite people to a tea tasting. I want to try. I jump on the trapeze bar and am swinging. It\\u2019s quite frightening. At first I\\u2019m just swinging back and forth and then I start doing more - when I swing forward I pike my body and touch my toes to the bar and do that a few times, making sure I don\\u2019t lose my grip. Then I work on the next stage of swinging my legs back and pushing myself up on the bar with my hands. I don\\u2019t quite get it. Then the dream dissolves and I\\u2019m now in an RV with Rose and a girl I knew from church in middle school. We are driving to a professor\\u2019s house at Stanford. The professor lives on Lake Lag, which is not really a lake because it\\u2019s drained most of the year. We pull the RV into the driveway and the girl from church gets out because she\\u2019s been here before. We follow her to a wooden gate. We\\u2019re looking for a way through so we can do some landscaping and cleaning of the yard. She finds a way through a small opening so we don\\u2019t have to climb over the fence. The professor who lives in the house comes out and is really surprised to see us, but he recognizes her so it\\u2019s okay. He gives me a cursory glance and then goes into the RV to look at it. He\\u2019s talking to her about her family. He has old video tapes in the front two pockets of his button down shirt. He says he must go because he has all this money in the games and must go play. He comments on Rose\\u2019s body and beauty, but says nothing about me. I think I need to change the way I dress because I\\u2019m wearing clothes that are too tight and used to fit me when I was 10-15 lbs lighter. Then we\\u2019re at a dinner party with multiple tables. It\\u2019s nighttime. There are couples. They don\\u2019t sit me next to my husband even though we\\u2019ve been doing well. I\\u2019m not happy to be sitting by myself at the end of the table. I feel awkward and have nothing to say, even though it\\u2019s really important to have something of interest to say at this party.\"],[\"I\\u2019m participating at a dance/yoga retreat at Esalen - again, this is my dream version of Esalen rather than the waking life one. There is a tantra retreat happening at the same time. The living accommodations are all quite disappointing and dilapidated. The mattress is old, flat, sagging and overused with broken springs and mold. The paint is peeling on the windowsill and the whole place feels like it\\u2019s falling apart. The shared bathroom is absolutely disgusting. The floors are wet with pee, the toilet paper is soggy from the humidity in the air. The people in the other workshop have left these grey innertube style structures over the bathtubs and toilets - the toilets look like big chairs. There\\u2019s nothing I can do about it because the other people were supposed to take care of their stuff. In another scene, I\\u2019m getting dressed with a group of women. Ella (from my priestess studies) is looking through my closet to help me choose an outfit to go to the dance club. She wants to find a floral drape she gave me years ago, but doesn\\u2019t know I got rid of it. She chooses a floral top for herself. I tell her it won\\u2019t fit her and she holds it against her body, and it\\u2019s clear to all of us except her that it\\u2019s too small. She thinks I\\u2019m being selfish rather than honest. My outfit is denim shorts with layered and fitted floral tops and a long necklace with a clear crystal at the end. The necklace hangs down between my thighs and I find it just very odd and uncomfortable. There\\u2019s another scene where I\\u2019m waiting at a studio to take yoga or dance. The schedule is really unorganized.\"],[\"I\\u2019m riding on a horse with a group of others. A woman and a young girl of about six or seven are riding on a horse together. The horses make a sharp turn and the woman and girl fall of their horse. The girl gets up on her own and seems fine. The woman needs more help.\"],[\"I\\u2019m simply at the job that I waitressed at for university. I liked working at the restaurant - it had good management and the team I worked with were excellent, but in the dream it is different. My section has about fourteen tables in it. The hostess continually seats people one after another in my section. As soon as I take a drink order from one table, she seats someone else. When I go to fulfill the drink order, there\\u2019s four more, and my section keeps expanding. So instead of ending at eight tables, there\\u2019s four more that I didn\\u2019t know about. I try to talk to her about this and tell her other servers need tables in theirs and ask her why she keeps seating me. The hostess stand is now miles and miles away from my section which is now miles and miles wide. People are angry with me. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s my drink? We\\u2019ve been sitting here too long.\\u201d I go back to get napkins and somebody\\u2019s spilled grape juice and it\\u2019s permeated every single white napkin. Everywhere I go to get more napkins there\\u2019s either coffee on it or something else. There\\u2019s no cutlery and it just goes on and on like that.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at a kitchen table with my ex-father-in-law. I\\u2019m in a big house. There are windows behind him. I can see out to rolling grasslands, what I imagine the flyover states would look like with fields of corn. He and I are negotiating the house - essentially living arrangements and the mortgage. The house is the one my ex and I owned together with my ex\\u2019s dad as our mortgage holder. My ex is not at the kitchen table, and not even in the picture. It\\u2019s just me and my ex-father-in-law talking. Initially, he\\u2019s just a total dick about it and threatening to foreclose and all that. I say to him, \\u201cYou can do that, but I don\\u2019t have a place to go if you do.\\u201d My ex-father-in-law says, \\u201cYes, well my son already has a home and all the things he needs and he has the kids.\\u201d I look at him like, \\u201cWow. Amazing that you have zero compassion.\\u201d Then something shifts. I don\\u2019t know if I say something to him that makes him reconsider or he just reconsiders. He says, \\u201cOkay, here\\u2019s what I\\u2019m willing to do. Sell this house, then go buy a smaller house. Whatever money you need to buy the smaller house will be there for you.\\u201d So, I leave this house where we are. My ex-father-in-law makes some suggestions. He says, \\u201cThere are a few houses down the road a little way in this little neighborhood that might suit you. It\\u2019s small and cute and you might like it, so go look.\\u201d I leave this kitchen table and the bigger house. I walk down the road. The rolling fields change and the scenery changes to a neighborhood with the houses quite close together. It is an established neighborhood that has been there for a while because all the trees and plants are so luscious and green. It\\u2019s definitely spring or summer because everything is leafed out and there are flowers everywhere and vines growing on houses. It is gorgeous and very alive with plant life. Instead of the ticky tacky style developed neighborhoods, it actually has quite a bit of charm. The houses were built individually with their own quirks and layouts. The house that I\\u2019m looking at is yellow, two-story, smaller. There is greenery everywhere. There is a road above and below, and a set of stairs that go down to the house. I\\u2019m on the stairs, walking down to the house, and I see there is a house at the top of the stairs. These stairs are super rickety and it looks like they\\u2019re held up by vines - not like cement stairs poured into the land, but wooden stairs that are somewhat free-hanging so they sway a bit like a bridge. On my way down these stairs and there are two infants who can barely crawl. They are tiny and they\\u2019re twins. One is falling down the stairs from this house at the top of the stairs. I\\u2019m fucking horrified! There is space between each step. The babies aren\\u2019t even old enough to crawl. One is actually still sitting in its carrier, not moving too much. But the other has sort of crawled out and is trying to head down these stairs, but essentially falling. I\\u2019m horrified that it will fall to its death. I pick up the one baby that\\u2019s falling. I look around for its parent. Its dad is sitting on the porch of the house at the top of the stairs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHello? Is this your baby? It\\u2019s falling to its death.\\u201d As I'm talking to him, a pair of younger women, I think they might be in their mid or late twenties, walk by me on the stairs. It\\u2019s interesting because the stairs are not particularly wide, so it\\u2019s hard to get by. They don\\u2019t really get by. They stop and say, \\u201cOh, these babies are his and he doesn\\u2019t take good care of them. You should take them. We\\u2019ll help you. We need to find their mother or a safe place for them.\\u201d I gather both babies up. The one that was falling shudders and relaxes as soon as I pick it up and hold it. You can tell the baby was so scared. This part of the dream ends with us going out to find somebody or the mother. As we head down the stairs, we go past this yellow house I was looking at. It\\u2019s even cuter close up and I think, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s where I want to live.\\u201d Then the dream switches and I\\u2019m with my ex-husband. We are in some sort of trial separation period. He\\u2019s gone off to live with this guy and I know he\\u2019s sleeping with this guy and that they have a thing going. My ex is trying to hide it from me, though, and I think it\\u2019s hilarious. I just wait for him to come out and tell me what\\u2019s going on. My ex still has my kids. I\\u2019m horrified because he keeps pawning the kids off to other people - the kids\\u2019 friends\\u2019 houses. I can tell our kids feel unanchored and untethered. But for some reason they don\\u2019t want to see me or aren\\u2019t allowed to see me. I get the sense that they don\\u2019t want to live with me and that\\u2019s part of the issue. They want to live with their dad because he doesn\\u2019t actually have rules and boundaries for them. So, at one point, I barely see my daughter and she gives me a nasty look. Then I see my son and he\\u2019s happy to see me, but he\\u2019s very preoccupied with friends and he\\u2019s riding his bike to their house. I ask my ex if it\\u2019s safe: \\u201cDo you know where the kids are? Do you know what they\\u2019re doing all the time? Can you get a hold of them if you need to? Do you have their phone numbers?\\u201d He\\u2019s very vague about it because he\\u2019s super-preoccupied with this man and this new partnership. We\\u2019re not completely separated in this dream. We aren\\u2019t living together, but my ex\\u2019s stuff is still in our bedroom - he still needs to clear his stuff out. I meet up with him somewhere at a park. He\\u2019s on a bicycle. There\\u2019s a white Range Rover parked on the side of the street. My ex says, \\u201cI want you to meet this guy.\\u201d I assume it\\u2019s the guy he has been sleeping with. I go to meet him and it\\u2019s someone I know from high school, Jon - a shorter Asian guy. I'm like, \\u201cOh my gosh! Hi, Jon. How are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m happy to see him. It\\u2019s been a while. He\\u2019s all weird and squirrely and so is my ex. They\\u2019re still trying to hide it from me. I\\u2019m having fun at this point, making it more awkward, because they\\u2019re being so silly about it. Then my ex comes back with me to the house because now he\\u2019s finally ready to get all his stuff out of the house. We\\u2019re lying in bed. We\\u2019re both like, \\u201cHow about one last screw to really make sure we\\u2019re really done?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like: \\u201cWell, at one point are you going to admit that you like both men and women?\\u201d For some reason it\\u2019s important for me to have him know that I knew all along. He finally admits it to me, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I knew this the whole time. Thanks for saying it. Okay, now let\\u2019s both have one last orgasm. Then get your shit and get out of the bedroom.\\u201d The dream ends there.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at a round table. There are other round tables pressed up around me with small groups of people. We\\u2019re at a restaurant. There are plates of mostly eaten food, spaghetti and such - basic American restaurant food. People are singing at the front. Each table begins to sing one at a time except for mine. Then next to me is a table with my friends, George and Kayla. George starts to speak like an African American preacher and says it like it is. They\\u2019re on their way to a conference or retreat. Then one of my past yoga teachers comes by my table and says something about the music and the retreat she lead and how every spot was full even though it was COVID, people needed retreat.\"],[\"I\\u2019m sitting at the table with my bodywork teacher and people who are new to his work and paying for continuing education. He invites me to stay, listen and learn again anything I\\u2019ve forgotten.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in line for the restroom. It\\u2019s a long line that\\u2019s not moving. I have to change for an event. My son and husband are waiting for me. It\\u2019s getting really late and it seems like I\\u2019ve been standing in line for a really long time. The line extends outside the bathroom doors and finally moves enough that I\\u2019m standing just inside. There are so many stalls and a few have open doors. When I peek in, I see women hovering their hands over the water, trying to cover what\\u2019s inside while waiting for the toilet to flush. I realize it\\u2019s taking so long because the toilets aren\\u2019t flushing properly. I step into a stall and squat and pee really fast then step out. A little while later, a woman goes into this stall and she\\u2019s disgusted because the seat is all wet. She steps out to get a towel to clean it up. I\\u2019m a bit ashamed, but I don\\u2019t think she knows I was the last person in that stall, and I also think it\\u2019s not pee, but rather splashback from a strong flush. Then we see another row of stalls - but it\\u2019s only changing rooms. Then somehow another row of stalls opens up and these have toilets. I\\u2019m trying to dressed for the event and realize it\\u2019s 11:30pm and my son is still awake! I give up trying to change because it\\u2019s just not working. I go find my family. They\\u2019re just playing, talking to people, laughing and having a good time. I\\u2019m surprised and think it\\u2019s maybe not as late as I thought it was. It\\u2019s only 6pm and we still have time to get my son home for bed. I\\u2019m relieved to see that my husband isn\\u2019t annoyed with me for taking so long. He seems understanding. The valet brings our car up. We get in the car to go to the house. The house is big, like the the ashram we visited recently in waking life. The people who live there aren\\u2019t around. We see a puppy in a big cage out front. The puppy is so cute - running around and happy. My son is especially excited to see it.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of \\u201chouse,\\u201d but I can\\u2019t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we\\u2019re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can\\u2019t live on Gaia anymore and it\\u2019s not worth the effort to try to save her. She\\u2019s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.\"],[\"I\\u2019m standing outside Roble Dance Hall at Stanford - the space where I danced in college. I\\u2019m standing in line with other dancers. We\\u2019re all the age we are now and many of us are not in the same dancing shape we were in college. I\\u2019m talking with Katie McGee who was at the time getting her a PhD in Psychology while I was undergrad. Now she\\u2019s becoming more known in the field of self improvement, psychology and stress. We\\u2019re talking about our time as dancers and I\\u2019m asking her if she ever comes back and takes classes. She answers, \\u201cOccasionally.\\u201d Then we go in and it\\u2019s like it always was - a big open space with tall windows and curtains from floor to ceiling. It brings back a lot of good memories. There\\u2019s a baker who has set up a little stand. She is a famous baker (though I don\\u2019t know about her in waking life). She\\u2019s known for her scones. I stand in line and see this delicious cake. I order a slice and am thinking of what to get for my son. I want something that\\u2019s not very sweet. I\\u2019m trying to tell her that I want the least sweet thing she has. She can\\u2019t hear me because there\\u2019s a lot of construction sounds in the background. I end up yelling, \\u201cLeast sweet! Least sweet! The not sweet one.\\u201d She finally understands me. She\\u2019s looking down at me from a platform and says, \\u201cWell, everything is sweet here.\\u201d Then she pulls a chunk of brown bread of the wall and gives it to me. She also gives me brown bread for me, too, so I don\\u2019t get the piece of pie I thought I ordered. I thank her and nipple on it. People have cleared out of the space now. There\\u2019s a threat - like a terrorist. But I\\u2019m not concerned yet. I see an empty Valentine\\u2019s Day card and write on it. It\\u2019s a lacy card that goes in a sheer lacy bag. I write a love note to the baker telling her how much I love her baked goods. Now the threat is real. Everyone scatters. The lights are turned off. I somehow am able to get out and we\\u2019re no longer on the Stanford campus. We\\u2019re at a restaurant by a lake and being served food. We hear gunshots and I learn that somebody is bleeding inside. But I\\u2019m safe for now. Then time passes. It seems like it\\u2019s finally safe to go. Then as I\\u2019m getting ready to go, I realize I\\u2019m not wearing any underwear or a bra, only a robe. I need to get a bunch of stuff together quickly and find a drawer with lingerie. I have a choice of 2 black bras - 1 plain and 1 lace - and I\\u2019m trying to decide what to bring. I choose one and some underwear and am now feeling more securely dressed. Then we\\u2019re off and I don\\u2019t recall the journey. Now I\\u2019ve been seated at a fine dining restaurant and am being poured a glass of champagne.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying at a big house. I\\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment with a woman who reminds me of Geri (a friend who worked for Burning Man and who I camped with a couple times) for 11am the next day. There are a lot of people here. I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It\\u2019s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn\\u2019t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I\\u2019m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She\\u2019s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can\\u2019t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I\\u2019m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I\\u2019m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren\\u2019t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day\\u2019s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I\\u2019m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I\\u2019m waiting at the couches - I\\u2019ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I\\u2019m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it\\u2019s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I\\u2019m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I\\u2019m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I\\u2019m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn\\u2019t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don\\u2019t want to do it anymore and I\\u2019m not going to come back. She says, \\u201cWell, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle. This is not something you give up so quickly.\\u201d I doubt myself and wonder if this is a good idea even though it doesn\\u2019t feel right or fitting. I agree to come back one more time to give it another chance.\"],[\"I\\u2019m staying in a suite that has a double door that can be closed or opened into another suite. Mine is the smaller one. The place next to me is more spacious and light with better air circulation and warmth. I\\u2019ve been sneaking next door to use their space to give healing sessions. I think I\\u2019ve been doing this unnoticed because I sneak in while they\\u2019re asleep upstairs. One early morning, the man wakes earlier than usual. He comes down and catches me. He tells me that I should leave and now that I\\u2019ve been caught I better not return because he knows I\\u2019ve been sneaking around and has sensed my presence there. He suggests that I don\\u2019t press my luck any longer and don\\u2019t use other people\\u2019s property in this way without permission.\"],[\"I\\u2019m struggling to recall everything but I have these intense memories of being with a group of people and bonding intensely because we had to and meeting in an apartment in a dark apartment somewhere. I don\\u2019t know if I was me but then we all got into this train together and someone else had to drive it. This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like \\u201coh shit\\u201d and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.\"],[\"I\\u2019m supposed to co-teach a yoga class with Les. People have arrived at the hotel. I\\u2019m there and walking around the room talking to the students. Then I realize I\\u2019m wearing a short white cotton dress. The room is heating up for class. I realize I\\u2019ll sweat and this dress will be transparent and I won\\u2019t be able to demo in it. I look up at the clock and see that I have just enough time to slip over to the boutique and pick up some yoga clothes. When I get there, the people are really helpful. They give me a bodysuit. I slip it on but it doesn\\u2019t look good at all. It\\u2019s taking a lot more time than I expected and there aren\\u2019t many other appropriate options for my body or teaching. Then I find a little pair of stretchy corduroy shorts and a top. I pull them on and think it will do. I go back and when I get back, the class is almost over and I\\u2019ve missed the whole thing while I was trying to find appropriate clothes to teach in.\"],[\"I\\u2019m swimming underwater with really bright colorful fish and coral contrasted by big black octopus, seal, shark and people swimming in snorkel or scuba gear. I\\u2019m struck by the contrast between color and black.\"],[\"I\\u2019m taking care of horses. There are a bunch of small properties next to each other. The boundary lines aren\\u2019t organized. The parcels are shaped oddly. There are some fences holding horses. In one place, the horses aren\\u2019t being well cared for. I have a job here now, and I don\\u2019t know what to do, but at least I care and in caring I\\u2019ll be able to help the horses.\"],[\"I\\u2019m traveling in a car with all my siblings - it\\u2019s a van so we can all fit. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going. We seem to be having an okay time. The scene changes really suddenly and there\\u2019s an impression that a lot of time has passed - weeks, months, perhaps. I\\u2019m really confused and don\\u2019t know how I\\u2019ve gotten to where I am. I feel like I\\u2019m waking up or seeing things that are really new and strange for me. My mom is there and she tells me that the car I had been traveling had crashed. My dad had been driving it and the accident was pretty bad. Everything is okay now. My body is fine. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with me. It seems so strange that there could have been an accident and I don\\u2019t remember it at all. She tells me it was pretty bad. I have no idea if my siblings or dad made it because it\\u2019s just me and my mom. The scene changes again and I\\u2019m with a bunch of friends from high school and some friends from now. We\\u2019re in a basement of a building. It has a huge storage unit and has all kinds of things in it from older times but also feels like a theatre costume room. We\\u2019re searching for a very specific item for one of my friends. As we go through all this stuff, it seems kind of weird - all these random bits of fabric and buttons. But we\\u2019re not finding what we\\u2019re looking for. Then the scene changes again. I\\u2019m on a soccer field and I\\u2019m really wanting to play, but I have these white shoes I need to put on and it\\u2019s taking me forever to put the shoes on and the laces are really long. My friend who is also a masseuse is there as well. He\\u2019s playing soccer and he\\u2019s playing really well. I want to go and play, but I also feel like maybe I\\u2019m not good enough and maybe that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s taking me so long to put my shoes on. Although he does keep trying to pass me the ball, but I\\u2019m still on the sidelines. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m not allowed to be on the team. It\\u2019s a full size field and a full size ball, then it suddenly switches to a very small room. We\\u2019re all still trying to fit in and play soccer, and the ball has shrunk down to about the size of a softball and it\\u2019s yellow. My friend keeps trying to pass the ball to me and I keep missing. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019ve never played soccer before. Then I get tired of it because I feel like I really can\\u2019t play and I can\\u2019t get these shoes on. All of my high school friends are still around and one of them is in a bed. I go sit on the bed and talk with her. Then a bunch of others come. They\\u2019re talking about all these adventures they\\u2019ve gone and are going to go on, and all these places they\\u2019ve seen around the world. I\\u2019m sitting there feeling frustrated because I\\u2019ve not done any of that - in my whole life, I\\u2019ve not gone to have a vacation in Costa Rica or Belize and they\\u2019re telling these fantastical stories of when they\\u2019ve gone. They\\u2019re also very chummy, but I feel like the outsider - definitely outsider vibes. Then the scene shifts a little bit, and while there\\u2019s still this big bed that we\\u2019ve all congregated on, now they\\u2019re talking about Brad Pitt and another actor from way back in the day. They\\u2019re talking about how Brad Pitt keeps saying that he could date any woman he wanted, but oddly enough, he\\u2019s still single and nobody really wants to date him and how he just brags all the time. Then we\\u2019re talking about Jennifer Lopez and how she has so much money because she bought an open market in France and charges a commission for each store that is there in the market and so she just makes this passive income forever and ever. Even magazines have commented on how she has this structure and foundation so she doesn\\u2019t have to rely on the work she puts out and if her albums are any good. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m trying to record a meditation or yoga video. I\\u2019m setting up my space and the camera, trying different locations and viewpoints. I need to set the camera at an angle so it doesn\\u2019t highlight my scoliosis because I think it would be a distraction. I set myself kind of under the staircase. I get a good frame but then realize my son\\u2019s Mickey Mouse car is in the frame and I have to rearrange the space again. It\\u2019s frustrating and I\\u2019m running out of time. I\\u2019m wondering where else I could do this, but anywhere else would have distracting background noises. I just want to get this done and move on. Earlier in the dream, there\\u2019s a show that we are preparing. We are a random group of people and I don\\u2019t recognize any of them. We haven\\u2019t rehearsed together, but are now suddenly being pulled together for this performance piece. I\\u2019m getting ready and a few women are helping me with my makeup. I need to choose a foundation and am asking them for their recommendation. One might be a bit too brown, but they say the pink one is nice and youthful. These women are very good with makeup and skilled in its application. I\\u2019m not so skilled with this particular art, but am grateful for their help. A woman is here and she is stealing everybody\\u2019s intellectual property by observing and copying their performances exactly. She\\u2019s stolen away and we have to find her and be sure she doesn\\u2019t succeed. All I have as clues is that she is wearing pale silk fabrics.\"],[\"I\\u2019m waking up at a festival. I\\u2019m walking through to the ocean or bay. I see that some others are still sleeping and the beds are set up to be floating over the ocean with only a white gauze curtain around for a little privacy. I\\u2019m curious about it. I see my friend Maxine walking around in a huge hoop skirt. It looks like she\\u2019s wearing a long curly wig that goes all the way to the ground. Other people are dressed up in festival attire. I don\\u2019t think I am, but I can\\u2019t sense much about myself. There\\u2019s a water slide that people go down to splash in the water. I\\u2019m supposed to be covering Sophie\\u2019s shift. I don\\u2019t know whether it starts at 9 or 9:30, but I need to get there. But now it\\u2019s raining and grey, and I know I\\u2019m in San Francisco. I\\u2019m wondering how I\\u2019ll get there and park and be on time. It\\u2019s more complicated than I thought it would be when I agreed to help. Now I realize it\\u2019s not a chiropractic shift, but I\\u2019m subbing a yoga or meditation class for her. I\\u2019m supposed to be teaching in another doctor\\u2019s office. It smells like cigarette smoke and really stuffy. All the other rooms are occupied and the doctor of physical therapist is running late. There isn\\u2019t enough room to teach a class and it won\\u2019t be worth my time or energy to do this, but I\\u2019ve committed. Then there\\u2019s a scene of my sister lying on her stomach and a prince speaking with her and evaluating whether she is a good choice for him or not.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a narrow street. It\\u2019s a street in a neighborhood and all of the houses, their big front lawns with green grass come right up to the edge. I walk past a front yard with a bunch of my friends sitting at a picnic table - three women sitting there talking. One of the women has long long hair - it touches the bench she\\u2019s sitting on. She\\u2019s in the middle with two other women sitting on the side. I\\u2019m walking down the street with a friend who is gorgeous. I stop and introduce her to the women. The one with the long hair just stops and stares and stares at my friend, doesn\\u2019t say much, just drinks her in with her eyes. We sit and chat for a little bit, and then we leave, continuing to walk down the street towards a house I\\u2019m staying in.There are a lot of people out and about. There\\u2019s a lot of people in this house. This house feels packed, like I\\u2019m a roommate with many many others. The house itself has a lot of things in it. It\\u2019s a little bit dark. I go to the plants on a windowsill that need watering. I water these plants while my gorgeous friend wanders around. I watch as everybody watches her and tries to watch her and make her acquaintance. Then the scene changes and I\\u2019m no longer in the house. I\\u2019ve walked out of it, past the women at the picnic table. I hear one of them laughing and giving the long haired woman a hard time about how attracted she was to my friend. She says, \\u201cYou gave her that new York stare.\\u201d I look at the woman with the long hair to see what her response is. She laughs but she also is very very intent on my friend. Then I am in what seems like my childhood home and there\\u2019s tons of people there, too. I can\\u2019t tell if they\\u2019re throwing a party or packing bags or what\\u2019s going on. There\\u2019s a lot of people and my dad is there and all of my siblings are there. I go out to the backyard. I want to get away from all the people and I want to go to the beach. My dad is standing in the backyard getting us ready to go the beach. He has bags ready to go and next to him is this dog that is as big as a llama. I stare because it is so huge and it starts to talk and tells me it is a dog that is part of llama and is really strong. It\\u2019s carrying all of these bags that we\\u2019ve packed. Some of the bags are my siblings\\u2019, some of the bags are my dad\\u2019s. I think he and I have a bag in there. My gorgeous friend is actually still with me somewhere. She\\u2019s milling about the house, wandering about the house, and she\\u2019s wandering in and out of the backyard. While I\\u2019m talking with my brothers and sisters, trying to organize how to get to the beach, she\\u2019s in and out and people are still staring, trying to get her attention. I\\u2019m becoming agitated because I can tell that I want to get to the beach, but I don\\u2019t want to ride with my siblings. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable with any of them. I can also tell that all of the strength in my body, all of the muscles I have are gone and it\\u2019s been some time since I\\u2019ve been able to work out and move. I want to go to the beach so I can get a workout in. It\\u2019s beginning to bother me that I don\\u2019t have those muscles and it\\u2019s beginning to bother me that my friend is not paying any attention to me even though she\\u2019s there with me and I know she wants to go to the beach with us. I walk around the corner of the house and there\\u2019s a line of cars - the cars that belong to my family and cars that belong to the people that are milling about the house and the yard. There\\u2019s two cars we can take to the beach and I tell my siblings that I want to drive them myself. I turn around and call my friend and tell her to come with. She\\u2019s aloof and nonchalant. We have an argument. I ask her why she won\\u2019t engage with me or speak with me. She knows how much I love her and how much I want her to be with me, and she just does not respond until I grab her wrist. She tells me that we both have work to do and will end up together eventually and I should stop because it makes her sad. Then she walks away and I\\u2019m feeling heartbroken. When I look up, my brothers and sisters and dad and the llama dog are gone. They\\u2019ve driven off. I grab my bag and run out to the road and start screaming because I can see the van that has my siblings in it as they\\u2019re driving off to go to the beach. They stop when they hear me screaming and I run and get into the car and I sit in the back. I\\u2019m not happy about that because I get very car sick. But we continue on and I ask where my dad and the llama dog went. The kids say they went to school. My dad had to drop the dog off and leave it at the school. We drive up that direction and my brother is driving too fast for this curvy road and he misses turns. We stop and pull into a driveway to pick up another friend and for the first time in my life I tell him I don\\u2019t trust his driving, he drives too quick, he\\u2019s scaring me and I don\\u2019t want to ride in the car because I don\\u2019t want to die. The dream ends and I never get to the beach.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down a street, it\\u2019s dark and wet, like it\\u2019s been raining all day. It\\u2019s not currently raining. I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called \\u201cKali\\u2019s Eyes.\\u201d I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn\\u2019t functioning well and I can\\u2019t find what I\\u2019m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I\\u2019ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it\\u2019s really crowded. I\\u2019m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they\\u2019ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can\\u2019t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I\\u2019m frustrated. It\\u2019s also still COVID, so it\\u2019s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that\\u2019s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I\\u2019d like to sit on, but they\\u2019ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it\\u2019s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It\\u2019s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They\\u2019re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other\\u2019s faces, so it\\u2019s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It\\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\\u2019t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.\"],[\"I\\u2019m walking down an alley between row houses. I\\u2019m with my husband. We walk by this one house with people gathered in the front. It\\u2019s a neighborhood block party. The front of their house is decorated with so many succulents of all shapes, sizes and colors, some in boxes, others growing like vines. I comment that \\u201cSnow and Shelly\\u201d would like it. But I mean \\u201cHanna\\u201d and I wonder why I keep calling her Snow? We continue to walk a little further. I hear them laughing about their friends \\u201cSlow\\u201d which is their nickname for Hanna and Shelly together. Then my husband and I get to the end of the alley. There\\u2019s a curio shop with all kinds of odds and ends. There\\u2019s a sign that looks like a fish and you can tell that it maybe once said Carmel, but part of it is missing so you only see the C at the fish\\u2019s face and the E-L at the tail. Then my husband reaches up and touches an interesting looking tapestry. He touches the border and tells me to touch it, too. It\\u2019s a really soft silky hair and leather texture, beautifully crafted. My husband takes it down and brings it inside. There\\u2019s an older woman dressed in a white lace bohemian dress behind the counter. There are two dogs running around. The dogs go from being really well behaved to one reaching for my fist with his mouth. While the woman is helping us check out, another dog starts running through the store and is being destructive. The man who is her husband and owns the shop with her comes out from behind the desk and goes after the dog to get him and rangle him back behind the desk along with the other one. I look at the tapestry and it\\u2019s no longer a rug, now it\\u2019s a dead dog that has been taxidermied. Now I understand why the leather was so smooth and shiny - it was once a shiny short haired soft dog. I don\\u2019t want it anymore. She says it\\u2019s really good for spellwork, protection and keeping the negative energies at bay. The man comes back and says, \\u201cYes it\\u2019s such a shame, the three dogs used to be a crew together. It\\u2019s a shame to see them separated now.\\u201d He is encouraging us to take it even though I\\u2019m apprehensive about having a dead dog in my house. Then there\\u2019s this yellow and white huge snake behind the counter next to the man. He taps the snake on the head and it starts to move. I can see its body starting to unknot from it\\u2019s sleeping position. It\\u2019s coming out from behind the desk and pushing the woman to the side. She stands back respectfully. I guess this is also one of their pets. The snake continues to unwind. The face kind of looks plastic but it\\u2019s acting real. I\\u2019m making sure to get out of the way. I\\u2019m trying to leave the shop and my husband is on the other side of the snake, also trying to get out. The snake continues to unwind and as it does, it is so huge, there is no tail in sight. Its body is filling every part of the shop. I can see the man trying to pull the snake back. I can see my husband trying to push through the body of the snake and trying to get out. Just as we reach the threshold, I see the snake open her mouth really wide and I see her fangs and tongue. The tongue is yellow and white and in the same pattern as the body. We get out.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching a fighting boxing ring at night and I\\u2019m not me, I\\u2019m an observer. Then the fight goes outside and they are jumping off of buildings dying by suicide. Then suddenly I\\u2019m watching these small vehicles low to the ground come towards me; in them young couples are wrestling the women in charge. They are sabotaging the car and pulling the men out onto the ground and then bears in cars after them. It was unreal.\"],[\"I\\u2019m watching my daughter from the edges of an ice rink. She\\u2019s ice skating and doing a show. I think we were there for practice but it ends up being a show. She\\u2019s in costume. There are a bunch of other ice skaters who are her teammates. They\\u2019re on the ice in the background. Then there\\u2019s one male ice skater. The others are all lined up and my daughter is in front of them. The one male ice skater comes around and as part of the show pulls her jacket off down around her arms and her body is that of a full grown woman. It\\u2019s a very sexual sensual move and I\\u2019m pissed off because she\\u2019s still a thirteen year old and she\\u2019s being super hyper sexualized in this show. I\\u2019m so mad. Her coaches are there critiquing because it is a rehearsal for the show. My daughter skates forward to do her move and something happens that I don\\u2019t quite see and she falls to the ice. Something happens to one of her legs. I\\u2019m so mad and I go grab her to make sure she\\u2019s okay. But this is not an appropriate show for a young girl to be doing. Then everybody goes home. I have her and her brother, too. Their dad is there, too. He\\u2019s been watching. I\\u2019m trying to spend time with the two kids because I haven\\u2019t seen them in a long time. I gather them both up in my arms and hold onto them and snuggle them. Their dad leaves and gives me some time with me. I try to connect. It\\u2019s a little awkward but there is some connection. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to go,\\u201d and he takes the kids with him. I\\u2019m following them out. We head out of the building where the ice skating rink is. Now I\\u2019m in this marina, so there are boats and everyone has a dock for their boats. The boats are coming back and forth, but people are also swimming in the water. There are set times when there are no boats and people can swim. Then there is time for the boats when you can\\u2019t swim because you\\u2019d get run over. I\\u2019m showing some of the kids in our group how to swim. I\\u2019m not sure who all is with us. A few people in their boats start to go boating when it\\u2019s still swimming time. People are yelling at the swimmers to get out of the water so they don\\u2019t get run over. I see this boat coming right up the lane and I flatten myself as much as I can on the floor of the marina - I think it\\u2019s a lake floor - so I don\\u2019t get chopped up by their propellers. I get up and people start dragging me out of the water once the boat passes over. I\\u2019m horrified that no one is being careful and that we\\u2019re in the water while boating is happening. We get out of the water. Somebody\\u2019s wedding is being prepped and they\\u2019ve asked me as a friend to come and help with it. Each of their friends are taking turns helping with the wedding. I think each of us has a day that we\\u2019re helping to prep. I get my day and I have a list. I don\\u2019t know who these friends are and I don\\u2019t even know who the friends of the friends are. It's a very strange situation because I don't know who I was just partying with at the marina and I don\\u2019t know whose wedding this is. I get a list of all the things that have been assigned to me to prep for this wedding. I walk through this door that will be the aisle we walk down, but the timing is bad because when we walk through it sets off an alarm that downs a bunch of trees right over the entrance and blocks it. It\\u2019s like when a castle is under siege and you\\u2019re pulling oil over people\\u2019s heads. The building or place has a protection mechanism; it reminds me of Hogwarts in the last movie. So all these trees come down right in front of me. The couple who is getting married is like, \\u201cThere goes my aisle to walk down.\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll clean up the trees and the other people can do the other stuff on the list.\\u201d I go to do that, but I think I get interrupted. Someone stops me to help them with something, but I go, \\u201cYeah, but I really have to move these trees.\\u201d The trees were dead to begin with and they weren\\u2019t actually trees, they were really big logs that have come across this doorway. The doorway is little; it\\u2019s like a one person doorway that you would go in and out of, say through your bedroom or something. But there is a red carpet that leads out from it, but now it\\u2019s covered in logs. These logs are white, either birch or aspen that have been cut and fallen. This dream ends with me being pulled away from this job to assist the bride. I\\u2019m sitting in a circle on a bench and there\\u2019s a woman with a white dress on. Her train is huge and beautiful. Her dress is very beautiful and sparkly, probably with sequins.\"],[\"I\\u2019m wearing some kind of white shirt and very short shorts\\u2026.Someone else is, too?....I look down and see four things, two white shirts and two shorts\\u2026.one is mine, the other someone else\\u2026.Another person thinks I look silly with such revealing shorts\\u2026.I look down at myself, and decide I do not care, it is fine with me, I like them\\u2026.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a friend from the pole studio and we\\u2019re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it\\u2019s not even a possibility for me. We\\u2019re both running around looking for a pole to buy that\\u2019s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It\\u2019s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there\\u2019s no place to workout. We\\u2019re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it\\u2019s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can\\u2019t find what we\\u2019re looking for. I dream some more but don\\u2019t remember what it was. Suddenly I\\u2019m with a Native American man. He\\u2019s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I\\u2019m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don\\u2019t recognize anybody I\\u2019m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they\\u2019ve bonded somehow. I\\u2019m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We\\u2019re in the forest somewhere. He\\u2019s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, \\u201cYou have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why that\\u2019s important but that\\u2019s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I\\u2019m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we\\u2019re protesting capitalism, basically. We\\u2019re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We\\u2019re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that\\u2019s happening with these young kids and how they\\u2019re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cUh are we going to go in and stop them?\\u201d but the man is like, \\u201cNope, we\\u2019re just going to listen and we\\u2019re going to make food.\\u201d We\\u2019re making food to bring. There\\u2019s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it\\u2019s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I\\u2019m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We\\u2019re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that\\u2019s different from what\\u2019s being taught and told about at this parade. We\\u2019re doing a silent protest. I\\u2019m freaking out because it\\u2019s children that they\\u2019re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can\\u2019t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It\\u2019s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that\\u2019s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we\\u2019re seeing or if we\\u2019re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there\\u2019s this younger dad who\\u2019s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that\\u2019s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, \\u201cYou have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn\\u2019t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.\\u201d I\\u2019m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, \\u201cOh, I have magic powers? I\\u2019m going to show you my magic powers.\\u201d All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don\\u2019t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it\\u2019s hurting my people and other people. He\\u2019s just so enraged, he\\u2019s lost it. He doesn\\u2019t care who he hurts. I\\u2019m horrified because I\\u2019m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can\\u2019t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won\\u2019t stop. I finally go, \\u201cOkay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What\\u2019s really going on?\\u201d He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won\\u2019t talk to him and he hasn\\u2019t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she\\u2019s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it\\u2019s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, \\u201cAre you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?\\u201d He\\u2019s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they\\u2019re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he\\u2019s so hurt and wounded. We\\u2019re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we\\u2019re conversing we\\u2019re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He\\u2019s an older man, he\\u2019s bald and he\\u2019s wearing all black. He says to me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.\\u201d For whatever reason I see him and am like, \\u201cOh my god, oh no.\\u201d I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I\\u2019m in a towel, I don\\u2019t have my clothes on and don\\u2019t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I\\u2019m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It\\u2019s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn\\u2019t warn them and don\\u2019t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I\\u2019m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don\\u2019t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn\\u2019t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that\\u2019s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren\\u2019t even ground up. I\\u2019m eating in a safe place where this man can\\u2019t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.\\u201d I need to get clothes but I\\u2019m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don\\u2019t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I\\u2019m doing. I\\u2019m pretty incoherent. I haven\\u2019t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they\\u2019re part of the oppressor group.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It\\u2019s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we\\u2019re on our way to the place. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s a road that\\u2019s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We\\u2019re driving down the road and it\\u2019s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We\\u2019re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there\\u2019s a ravine under us. We\\u2019re headed to a cave where we\\u2019re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it\\u2019s like - it\\u2019s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I\\u2019m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there\\u2019s water that\\u2019s swirling around the rocks. It\\u2019s so fun because we\\u2019re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I\\u2019m floating and we\\u2019re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We\\u2019re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it\\u2019s smooth and flat. It\\u2019s still light in a sense, it\\u2019s not full daylight. We can still see. It\\u2019s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we\\u2019re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It\\u2019s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I\\u2019ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it\\u2019s very particular, it\\u2019s something I asked for. Then it\\u2019s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I\\u2019m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that\\u2019s everywhere and the flowers - they\\u2019re gathering them. It\\u2019s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There\\u2019s now a table. There\\u2019s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she\\u2019s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they\\u2019re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we\\u2019re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we\\u2019re carrying bags of trash because we\\u2019ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we\\u2019re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn\\u2019t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people - I know some of them, they\\u2019re acquaintances that I\\u2019ve met here where I live, but we\\u2019re not close. We\\u2019ve met up and we\\u2019re going to a concert, but it\\u2019s music I don\\u2019t know or I don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not excited about it, but it\\u2019s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There\\u2019s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it\\u2019s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we\\u2019re listening, and I\\u2019m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I\\u2019ve met them before or they\\u2019re from some era of my past. We\\u2019re listening and while we\\u2019re listening there\\u2019s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it\\u2019s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don\\u2019t. So I\\u2019m just sewing away and now it\\u2019s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can\\u2019t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I\\u2019m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don\\u2019t tangle my threads and it\\u2019s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I\\u2019m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I\\u2019ve been in a bowling alley. There\\u2019s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I\\u2019m just watching them bowl and they\\u2019re all having a really good time. It\\u2019s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I\\u2019ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It\\u2019s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it\\u2019s time for me to bowl. It\\u2019s not time because I\\u2019m part of their team or anything; I\\u2019m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I\\u2019m so terrible at it. It\\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. So, I\\u2019m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there\\u2019s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it\\u2019s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can\\u2019t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can\\u2019t go head on or straight. So it\\u2019s somebody else\\u2019s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there\\u2019s a person sitting in the way. So it\\u2019s my turn again and I go to him and say, \\u201cCould you please move so I can bowl correctly?\\u201d The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he\\u2019s watching me to see if I\\u2019m going to get it. There\\u2019s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I\\u2019m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it\\u2019s my turn and he\\u2019s not in my way, I go to bowl and it\\u2019s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It\\u2019s the most beautiful bowl you\\u2019ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of people I don\\u2019t recognize. We\\u2019re all on vacation of some sort. There are at least eight of us, if not more. We\\u2019re at the rental car place to get cars for the group. There are so many of us that we\\u2019re taking multiple cars. I watch four of us get a car and talk to the rental car agent and get in the car and drive off. There\\u2019s another four of us waiting for a car. I\\u2019m hoping for a Toyota Tacoma to drive because that would be a lot of fun. So the rental car agent comes back and walks the four of us to our car. Sure enough, it\\u2019s a Tacoma. There\\u2019s another woman in the group with me and two men. The woman wants to drive and I\\u2019m like no way, because the Toyota Tacoma is my favorite car, so I\\u2019m the driver. I have the rental agent put my name on as the driver and I get the keys and we all get in. I went to drive the truck and I\\u2019ve forgotten how bouncy trucks are. For some reason I\\u2019m scared that the brakes on this truck don\\u2019t work very well. I\\u2019m going really slow as I pull out of the parking lot which looks like an underground garage. I can tell everyone in the car is annoyed that I\\u2019m driving so slow, but I don\\u2019t think the brakes work super well so I\\u2019m not going to drive super fast. We drive off the lot but I don\\u2019t remember where we go. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m with a bunch of people. There's a black guy who\\u2019s a DJ. Again, I don\\u2019t recognize anyone. I think I\\u2019m stirring a pot of soup. The guy is playing music and helping me cook or at least putting in his two cents about how it should be cooked. It\\u2019s uncomfortable for me because I\\u2019m trying to cook and he\\u2019s playing music, and I\\u2019m not trying to tell him how to play music. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s dancing but there are people dancing. We are outside. The pot I\\u2019m stirring is huge. At one point I think I put everything down so I can dance. It\\u2019s really good music and it\\u2019s a lot of fun. But then there\\u2019s another interaction between him and me. When I put the ladle down to dance, he picked it up. Then the dream fades and I don\\u2019t remember anything else.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a group of women but I don\\u2019t know any of them at all. They\\u2019re younger, in their twenties and early thirties. We\\u2019re together on a boat, I think. There\\u2019s water everywhere. It\\u2019s clearly a group of witches. Most of them are just beginning to learn spellwork. I\\u2019m the only one there who knows how to do it. There are rituals happening or perhaps initiation. One of the younger women is guiding us through the process. I don\\u2019t know that I\\u2019ve actually received training and I already know how to do all of it and I\\u2019m just going along and it\\u2019s perfectly fine for me to be doing that. I don\\u2019t have any need to let them all know that I already know how to do all of it. I\\u2019m just there with them, watching and observing. Each woman is taking turns and we\\u2019re creating a circle. The woman who is leading all this is standing in the center and each woman being initiated is walking in a circle around the other woman and the rest of us are watching. I\\u2019m part of the crowd watching the younger woman in the center. As each woman goes and does her initiation and shows what spells she knows, she\\u2019s walking around the other woman in a circle. The thing is, we\\u2019re all walking on water. The boat or whatever we were on is around somewhere, but we\\u2019re off of the boat and each of us is either standing on water or walking on water. You can see the shore from where we are and it\\u2019s a rocky shore. Then it\\u2019s my turn to go and walk on water in the circle. There\\u2019s a dress I put on. This dress is a purple taffeta, shiny and stiff. The purple is a deep black purple and it shimmers with black. It\\u2019s very Victorain era looking with tons of folds and gathers and ruffles, but it\\u2019s not super girly, it\\u2019s quite elegant. I put this dress on and start walking the circle on the water. As I start to walk, my power starts to rise. I\\u2019m no longer hiding that I have power and know how to use it. The water starts to churn and with the other women the water was not churning. As I walk, the water starts to churn around and around. This is where I recognize that the dress I\\u2019m wearing is actually a dress of Helen\\u2019s, it\\u2019s a priestess dress imbued with power and I\\u2019m wearing it. The woman in the center who was leading us the whole time is a little startled because this hasn\\u2019t happened with the other women she was initiating. I have a little smile on my face because I know I\\u2019m invoking something that\\u2019s a little bit older than what any of them have ever seen and that I\\u2019m calling on the water elemental and the air elemental as the wind starts to blow. I can hear that Helen has shown up or her presence has shown up. She\\u2019s whispering in the ear of the woman in the center and the woman in the center is in awe. She thinks Helen is a guide from somewhere and she\\u2019s quite in awe. I know who it is and I can hear what she has to say and it\\u2019s all wise teachings, but the awe is not there for me because I know who it is. The woman in the center passes on as Helen speaks it as prophecy. I sort of grin and let her speak as I continue walking my circle and creating this water vortex that is spinning. Then my turn is over and it\\u2019s time for some of the other girls to go. This vortex I created with the water and wind stays and adds itself to the ceremony ritual happening. The woman in the center keeps babbling on about how wise and mystical this guide is. I say, \\u201cYes, she\\u2019s quite wise and ancient and she\\u2019s very powerful,\\u201d knowing it was Helen speaking but what was channeling through her were the powers of Avalon that are very ancient and old. But I don\\u2019t tell any of the other participants what it is because it seems it\\u2019s over their head and this is a good first mystical experience for them. The dream ends with us dispersing. We leave the water and the boat but I don\\u2019t know where we all go.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we\\u2019re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I\\u2019m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I\\u2019m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That\\u2019s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I\\u2019m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There\\u2019s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I\\u2019m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, \\u201cI was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.\\u201d She lists the women, but I don\\u2019t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it\\u2019s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don\\u2019t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It\\u2019s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He\\u2019s playing with the water from the fridge. He\\u2019s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I\\u2019m concerned that I don\\u2019t have anyone to take care of him and that he\\u2019s disturbing the session. But my client doesn\\u2019t seem to notice or care that he\\u2019s interfering.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with a ton of people I don\\u2019t know and we\\u2019re on a tour. The astrologer who I know from my studies is there and we\\u2019re in this huge area that reminds me of the Hawaiian Hilton where they have these big fake rocks by a pool and you can climb over and around them and there\\u2019s a slide you can go down. So we\\u2019re in this building with lots of rocks and water, but it\\u2019s also an old sewing shop. There are all these sewing patterns everywhere, still in their envelopes. The woman who owns the shop is showing us around. But it\\u2019s not a shop, it\\u2019s way bigger, and an open space. The tour is over. To get out of the building, you have to climb in a very specific pattern over these rocks. I watch somebody ahead of me. We get to this one section and it\\u2019s kind of like bouldering. Instead of taking hand and footholds, they decide to slide down the rock face, thinking it\\u2019s not so far. I watch them slide and am like, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s far.\\u201d They land in the pool beneath them, but the pool is not particularly deep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, okay, I\\u2019m not going to do that.\\u201d Then the astrologer goes and she\\u2019s a much bigger woman. She shows me how to use the handholds and footholds. She misses and falls down the rock face. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, this is not good.\\u201d I see some younger girls, like nine or ten years old and I watch where they put their hands. They manage to get down off this part where the others were sliding and slipping. I follow them and end up in this place where there are even more patterns lined up on a bench. I recognize some of them from my mom\\u2019s sewing patterns from when I was a kid. There are other ones that are new in their envelopes. I\\u2019m looking at them but not spending a lot of time because I know it\\u2019s time to go. I just kind of try to keep going. Then the dream switches. I\\u2019m in a house that I\\u2019m sharing with a bunch of people. We\\u2019re in the kitchen area. I think it\\u2019s mostly women and possibly my friends Shawna and Janet from high school, but I\\u2019m not sure. There are others I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m in the kitchen. There\\u2019s a double cupboard that goes from floor to ceiling. You can open these tall doors and get into the cupboard. The top cupboard has a bunch of glasses in it and I\\u2019m looking for my black nail polish. One of my gay flatmates has used it all up and I\\u2019m pissed up. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWait, I want my nail polish.\\u201d I\\u2019m looking in this cabinet for it. There are champagne flukes and port glasses and really heavy-bottomed cut crystal water glasses. They keep getting broken so there\\u2019s maybe one of each of them. I\\u2019m trying to move them around so I can look for the nail polish. I\\u2019m handing them to my roommates to put them in the trash. The trash is overflowing. I\\u2019m handling these pieces of glass and trying to be super careful, but I don\\u2019t know where to put all the pieces. I gather up the trash bag and head out to the trash, which is the dumpster area by the condo area that I live in in this reality. Then the scene changes. I\\u2019m with a younger version of Josh, he\\u2019s maybe in his mid-twenties, and all the people who were part of my kink family this year. There are some additions, girls I don\\u2019t recognize. We\\u2019re in a car going somewhere. We\\u2019re going through a town that reminds me a lot of Hawaii. I feel like we\\u2019re in Kona. Josh is on the lookout, scanning for other women to fuck. I\\u2019m with him and ignoring it. We\\u2019re driving by the ocean on the other side of the rock wall. We\\u2019re going past buildings. I can see surfers out in the water. I\\u2019m ignoring Josh and the constant scanning that he\\u2019s doing. Some of the kink family is in the background. He\\u2019s flirting with them like he usually does. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI have this chiropractic appointment and so do you.\\u201d We\\u2019re on our way and end up at the chiropractor\\u2019s office. It\\u2019s an open office because I can see other people watching. Josh gets his adjustment and the chiropractor cracks him really good, not the way I would allow anyone to crack me. Then it\\u2019s my turn and the chiropractor is moving really slow with me, which I appreciate. He gets to my left shoulder and is like, \\u201cOh, there\\u2019s something wrong with your rotator cuff.\\u201d All he did was put his hand on the back of my shoulder blade. I didn\\u2019t tell him it hurt, he didn\\u2019t move it or anything. He was just moving me around and as he put his hand on the back of my shoulder blade, he said, \\u201cOoh, there\\u2019s something wrong with your rotator cuff.\\u201d He gets these weird hooks with rubber bands connected to them. He hooks them all together and wraps them around my wrist. He puts one hand on my shoulder and he goes to adjust my rotator cuff. He\\u2019s yanking on it. I\\u2019m expecting to hear some horrible pop, but he\\u2019s actually really gentle and just keeps pulling on it in different directions. I\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s going to be able to do anything and don\\u2019t believe he is doing anything. But whatever, I let him do it because he\\u2019s not hurting me. Then I come out of the dream a little bit and I realize that my chin is tingling and I need to go put some helichrysum and ice on my chin to stop my cold sore from getting worse. That was somehow part of the dream, too. I\\u2019m on a cell phone and I can hear everybody on my council talking. I\\u2019m listening in like I normally would because we\\u2019ve been doing our council call on zoom because of all the things. I contribute my two cents to whatever is being spoken about. One of the other council ladies is like, \\u201cRose, are you there?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I called in.\\u201d I think it was Aila. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know that my phone was on and you could hear me. Did you know we were meeting today?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, I knew. Although I didn\\u2019t know you were all meeting in person. Did you all plan that?\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, we didn\\u2019t think you were coming so we\\u2019re all meeting here in person.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?! Okay I\\u2019ll just come and find you.\\u201d I go find them, but there\\u2019s that yucky feeling of being left out. I go and see them. It\\u2019s fine. Everybody is there and we\\u2019re all talking. For some reason the topic of dicks comes up. Aila is like, \\u201cYeah, you should see the one I got!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s talking about. Did she get a dildo? Is she talking about her partner? I have no idea. Beth chimes in and is like, \\u201cYeah, look at mine.\\u201d I\\u2019m sitting on the ground and turn to the right and look up. She has her pants pulled down and she has a dick that\\u2019s half chub. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBeth! Is that yours? Did you get a sex change?\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s my partner\\u2019s. I just took it for a while.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know you could just do that. Okay.\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with all my classmates from high school. We\\u2019re in an outdoor setting. I can see reeds growing in a river. The air is fresh. It\\u2019s definitely twilight into nighttime. I don't know why we\\u2019re all there. The energetic feeling is heavy. Some of us are sitting in chairs, some are standing. We\\u2019re milling about like at a party. The mood is somber. I\\u2019m wondering why we\\u2019re all sad, I don\\u2019t get it and don\\u2019t see a need or reason for us to be this way. I make a decision to cheer everybody up. It\\u2019s a little scary for me to make this decision because now I know I need to put myself out there. I start making jokes. I don\\u2019t know what the jokes are about. I feel myself try one joke with a bit of trepidation to see if people will laugh, and they do. I get a little bolder and continue to make situational jokes using things that are happening in the moment and pointing out the environment and saying funny things. People are laughing and the whole mood of the dream changes from this really dark, heavy, somber mood. It doesn\\u2019t get all the way happy, but there is a relief with laughter. I can see Shawna laughing. That changes the whole dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with Anya, Moira, Kel, and a new patient who I haven\\u2019t met yet. The office is down the street from a big house that is being used for multiple offices. I\\u2019m in the house. Anya and Kel are helping me set up the tables upstairs. People are arriving for sessions. A fire is lit in the fireplace. It\\u2019s dark and musty. There are quite a few massage and chiropractic tables folded in their traveling bags. There are tables and stacked chairs. I\\u2019m trying to figure out how to set up the table for privacy and professionalism for my new patient, but it\\u2019s chaotic. This is a way for me to practice and for people to watch me work and potentially become patients.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my brother, sister and son whois 4 or 5 in this dream. We\\u2019re on a rooftop of a building. The building is a college. I have my son in multiple pairs of pants. He\\u2019s old enough to get dressed himself and he comes out wearing this. Even though he seems to be younger, he\\u2019s also 9 - his age is ambiguous. My brother is young and looks as though he did in high school. My sister also looks younger, like how she did in high school. There\\u2019s a break in college and we\\u2019ve all met up between classes and have gone out onto this rooftop. You can see this black wall of clouds off in the distance. They are turning greenish and as I\\u2019m watching, they form a funnel and there\\u2019s a tornado heading our direction. I\\u2019m yelling at my son to go in the door we came out of onto this rooftop. There\\u2019s also a set of fire escape stairs. My brother is over there. My brother and sister were excited about the parties they were going to go to. They are totally doing the college thing. But I\\u2019m thinking I\\u2019m too old for this shit and I don\\u2019t drink - it\\u2019s not my thing - plus I have this little one to take care of. So I see this funnel and am yelling at my brother and sister to look and be careful. I\\u2019m also yelling at my son to run back in the door inside where he\\u2019ll be safe. My son goes inside and is panicked. My brother and sister do not believe me and just stay out there. I watch through this thick glass window. As the storm tornado goes by, this woman appears and she\\u2019s sitting in a chair. The chair is small and wooden with two slots across the back. It\\u2019s like she was the tornado or was in the tornado. She\\u2019s telling my siblings what to do. So instead of the tornado sucking them up and carrying them off, she\\u2019s telling them to go jump off the edge of the roof. She\\u2019s saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to die either way, but I\\u2019m telling you that instead of sucking you up, you\\u2019re just going to jump off.\\u201d I\\u2019m horrified. I want my siblings! But I also want to protect my son. I know at any point, if she turns around and sees us or especially sees my son, she\\u2019ll kill us, too. So I\\u2019m not being gentle with my son at all. I\\u2019m being really rough and have grabbed him by his shirt. I\\u2019m shoving him down because there\\u2019s a dresser between us and the window. The woman is on the other side. All I can see is the back of her and she\\u2019s sitting in the chair. Her hair is dark and is up in a bun. I can\\u2019t see much else. So I\\u2019m shoving my son down so she can\\u2019t see him. The dresser is between them. He keeps trying to pop up to see her, and I very roughly shove his body back down. I\\u2019m yelling at him to stay down so she can\\u2019t see him. I see my brother and sister disappear. She disappears and the funnel dissipates even though the clouds dissipate. I tell my son to stay and I go out the door to look. Of course there is no sign of my brother and sister anywhere. My son is distraught. He\\u2019s screaming and crying and so mad at me for being rough at him and so upset about his aunt and uncle leaving. He regresses into a younger child, from 9 to 3. I feel horrible because I was so physically rough with him and verbally unkind in trying to keep him hidden. I think I just traumatized him in so many ways.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my dad and my mom, my five brothers and my sister. I think it\\u2019s the whole family. We\\u2019ve had to go through customs or some kind of holding area. There was a conference - somebody was giving a talk and we were there for that talk. We had to get on a tram to get to the airport lounge to get on our plane. I\\u2019m there where I\\u2019m supposed to be. But two or three of my siblings are not there. We can\\u2019t find them. I\\u2019m starting to get stressed because they haven\\u2019t met us where we\\u2019re supposed to all be. The communication between my parents and siblings is shit. No one is telling anyone what they need to know. Part of it is we either don\\u2019t have our cell phones or don\\u2019t have service. There\\u2019s an actual physical communication breakdown, but also distance. Some siblings wander off and miss the tram they\\u2019re supposed to be on and don\\u2019t show up where they\\u2019re supposed to go. I get two or three of my siblings and we show up where we\\u2019re supposed to go, but then we realize we\\u2019re in the wrong spot or the gate has been moved. We have to get back on another tram and go back to where we had come from, or so I think. We go and we do it. My parents and my grandma finally get a hold of us and are like, \\u201cNo, you could have stayed where you were at. Now it\\u2019s going to take you longer to get where you\\u2019re going and you\\u2019re possibly going to miss this plane or tram.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure which - plane or tram. There is a lot of back and forth, not going to the right place, not finding each other, not communicating well. We realize we are retracing steps we didn\\u2019t need to retrace. We didn\\u2019t have to go back to the place we went back to. It would have been better if we stayed where we were, or even better, moved forward. This moving forward is just a vague sense or feeling that there\\u2019s a moving forward that could happen. But trying to get me, all my siblings, my parents and my grandma all in one place so that we can all travel together is just not happening. Two of my siblings are pissed at me for leaving them behind even though they wandered off - they took it upon themselves to go elsewhere and then were mad at me that I didn\\u2019t take them with me when it was time to go. So lots of feeling of frustration and herding cats, then me going like, \\u201cHey, wait a second, you all are adults. I\\u2019m not responsible for you! Yes you\\u2019re my younger siblings. But you are adults who can get yourself where you need to go. So I don\\u2019t need to worry about this so much!\\u201d That was the overall tone of the dream.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We\\u2019re outside and there\\u2019s a picnic table. I think there\\u2019s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We\\u2019re a part of that. She\\u2019s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She\\u2019s hosting. I\\u2019m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They\\u2019re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it\\u2019s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There\\u2019s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I\\u2019m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I\\u2019m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they\\u2019re saying and learn from them. I think I\\u2019m really not welcome here. I don\\u2019t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I\\u2019m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It\\u2019s getting heated. They\\u2019re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I\\u2019m feeling all of these emotions. I\\u2019m pissed that that\\u2019s their reality and mine. I\\u2019m pissed that I feel like there\\u2019s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it\\u2019s more equal and fair for everyone. I\\u2019m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I\\u2019m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They\\u2019re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they\\u2019re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, \\u201cHey, I want you two to know that I\\u2019ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you\\u2019re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.\\u201d As I\\u2019m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don\\u2019t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I\\u2019m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn\\u2019t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can\\u2019t tell if they appreciate what I\\u2019m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I\\u2019m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There\\u2019s a wooded forest behind me. There\\u2019s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I\\u2019m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they\\u2019re young. I\\u2019m a young adult in this place, or I\\u2019m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They\\u2019re playing and they\\u2019re hungry. They want something to eat. There\\u2019s a guy and in my head I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201coh my god, pedophile.\\u201d I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they\\u2019re playing. The kids say they\\u2019re really hungry and the guy is like, \\u201cWell, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.\\u201d I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019re all hungry. There\\u2019s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don\\u2019t even know where it\\u2019s plugged into. It\\u2019s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don\\u2019t want to take the meat from this guy because I don\\u2019t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He\\u2019s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he\\u2019s watching them play. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t even watch them play.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it\\u2019s safer. I don\\u2019t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I\\u2019m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that\\u2019s right after me. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re talking about. We are in a different place. They\\u2019re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they\\u2019re in is devoid of trees. It\\u2019s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn\\u2019t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I\\u2019m talking to them and I\\u2019m checking in with them. But part of me doesn\\u2019t want to be talking about this with them because they\\u2019re not listening to me. They\\u2019re not hearing me. I\\u2019m not getting a say. I\\u2019m not getting to use my voice about this. They\\u2019re just telling me how things are. I\\u2019m annoyed because that\\u2019s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They\\u2019re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they\\u2019re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, \\u201cDo you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?\\u201d But they\\u2019re not listening and not open to it. I\\u2019m not saying anything. I\\u2019m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my friends who are part of my council. We\\u2019re all gathered. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re doing, an adventure of some sort. My one friend who is in the middle of leaving her partnership is with me. She\\u2019s the nearest to me. The other friends are more in the background. We are getting on boats in the ocean. I don't know where we\\u2019re going. The founder of Astrology Hub which is a service I pay for is also there. I don\\u2019t know what she\\u2019s doing. I think she\\u2019s leading this excursion adventure we\\u2019re going on. There\\u2019s a big cruise ship that everyone is getting on and then there are some smaller fishing boats that can go quickly and are pretty open but can only sit about five or six people. My friend who\\u2019s leaving her partner gets on a fishing boat with me. The captain of the boat is an older man in his fifties or sixties, grey haired, pot bellied, white dude. He\\u2019s excited to be driving us \\u201ctwo pretty ladies around\\u201d - his words. He is really fawning over my friend. She\\u2019s leaning into this free and single thing now. He\\u2019s letting her drive the boat but she doesn't let her drive. It\\u2019s kind of stormy. The waves are high, the skies are grey, it\\u2019s raining. We\\u2019re on the boat that doesn\\u2019t have a roof, so we\\u2019re going to get wet, but everyone on the cruise ship will be fine and dry. There are cameras around and this is being filmed or recorded. I\\u2019m watching another friend do a spiel for the cameras, but I can\\u2019t hear what she\\u2019s saying. There is a hustle and bustle as everyone gets on the boats. So we start to head out into the ocean and the old guy is letting my friend drive. My friend is loving it and saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m so free!\\u201d The wind is blowing in her hair and she\\u2019s so excited and so happy. I\\u2019m sitting in the back and am like, \\u201cYes, you are totally free right now, but it feels like the pendulum is swinging the other way.\\u201d At one point I look over and she\\u2019s making out with this old guy who is not her type and kind of gross. She\\u2019s like twenty years younger than him. I remember going through this phase and know this is a phase she has to go through - whatever floats your boat girl. We head out into the ocean and I have a sense that the cruise ship is around but I don\\u2019t see it and I don\\u2019t see the rest of my friends on council, I just know they\\u2019re there. We\\u2019ve gone from being in a wide open ocean to canals like in Venice. We\\u2019re going through these waterways with buildings on either side. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re going, but my friend is still driving and she\\u2019s still making out with this guy. She\\u2019s also talking about all her dreams and all the things she\\u2019s going to do. She has flowers in her hair and is wearing a shawl. I\\u2019m wondering now what happened to the cruise ship and all our other friends. I\\u2019m ready to get off the boat because I\\u2019m feeling seasick. I don't know if we ever get to our destination or not. But the scene changes and I\\u2019m on dry land. I\\u2019m with a bunch of other people I know. I can\\u2019t tell if we\\u2019re at a grocery store where we\\u2019re all working or somewhere else and hanging out. It\\u2019s a bunch of random men I know - some co-workers, some classmates, some others. It reminds me of a beehive or anthill energy - a bunch of busyness, coming and going, coming and going. People are doing things. We all have our own projects. It dawns on me that every single man is wearing a sweater I knit for them in this dream. Some of the men are my childhood buddies that I grew up with, too. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my gosh I knit you that sweater!\\u201d The sweaters are all different styles and colors. It\\u2019s clear they\\u2019ve been worn a lot. The funny thing is that they\\u2019re just wearing the sweaters, but not saying, \\u201cHey, I\\u2019m wearing your sweater!\\u201d\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my partner and his dad. We\\u2019re rearranging the furniture. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood, not a house. There\\u2019s a cul-de-sac in this area. His dad is wanting to make it into an entertainment room. He buys a big futon and sets it up. He\\u2019s very childlike in his excitement about this futon. He\\u2019s showing it to me and wants to make sure it\\u2019s the right size and fits and is not too heavy or too stiff, and it\\u2019s comfortable and in the right place in the cul-de-sac. It\\u2019s so strange because it goes between being outside and being an actual room. As the dream progresses more and more furniture shows up and the room starts to be enclosed with walls on two sides and then sliding glass doors on the other side. Curtains show up. There\\u2019s a couch now and a piano and side tables etched in gold. It\\u2019s quite fancy, actually. Josh\\u2019s dad is asking me, \\u201cIs this how you want this room set up? What do you think about the placement of all the furniture? What about the tv? Is there a better place for everything?\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at it. They have the tv set up against the sliding glass doors and the curtains are drawn. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, I think there\\u2019s a better way than to block these doors with furniture.\\u201d I can feel myself standing there contemplating a better arrangement. But they\\u2019re so happy with how it is. They\\u2019re trying to convince me of why it\\u2019s good. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, just leave it, let it be.\\u201d Then the dream ends and I\\u2019m in a car. We\\u2019re driving around this same cul-de-sac and trying to figure out how to get back to that room. His dad is like, \\u201cI think if we take this way, we\\u2019ll end up where we want to be.\\u201d I can see that there\\u2019s this gate in between that cul-de-sac and where we want to be. If we go right, it takes us up a hill and I keep going like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think this will get us where we want to go.\\u201d It\\u2019s very interesting, I just know that even though we can see that cul-de-sac and I can actually see the futon he bought, we can\\u2019t get to it in the car we\\u2019re in. we do have to drive up and around. I\\u2019m not sure. There\\u2019s this weird sense that we get there in the car but I\\u2019m not sure why.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with my son and we are going to an event - it\\u2019s a game you play and you can win money if you get the answers right, kind of like Jeopardy or something. We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it. My son is about 10 or 11 in the dream. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go do this! It will be fun.\\u201d He\\u2019s kind of dubious. I\\u2019m also a little dubious. I\\u2019m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we\\u2019re going to do this trivia type thing and it\\u2019s all shit I don\\u2019t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We\\u2019ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I\\u2019ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven\\u2019t answered them at all because I didn\\u2019t know the answer. I\\u2019m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can\\u2019t believe I don\\u2019t know the answers to any of these things. I\\u2019m going like, \\u201cWell, this is shit I don\\u2019t care about, so of course I don\\u2019t know the answers.\\u201d All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I\\u2019m completely clueless. Their judgement and my judgement are super real. My son is looking at me like, \\u201cMom, this is not fun.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, this is not fun at all.\\u201d I\\u2019m wanting to leave because I honestly don\\u2019t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with the kids and I\\u2019m in a city I don\\u2019t recognize at all. I think it\\u2019s supposed to be Seattle because there\\u2019s ocean and hills. It\\u2019s definitely a city. My ex shows up and his parents show up. I get this feeling of, \\u201cOh my god, get the fuck away from me.\\u201d His dad is the most prominent person in the dream. He\\u2019s scolding me like I\\u2019ve done something wrong and I need to go with them somewhere. We get in the car - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s my car or their car, but it\\u2019s a stick shift. I\\u2019m driving it backwards, like I\\u2019m in reverse the whole time. I\\u2019m having a fucking hard time staying on the road the GPS is telling me to go on. I keep driving onto the wrong road. At one point I get in a parking lot and I go around the parking lot three times. His dad is being condescending and telling me I\\u2019m going the wrong way. But I\\u2019m driving the way he wanted me to drive or the way he was showing me to drive and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m having such a hard time. Finally after three or four attempts of trying to get on the right road to get where we were supposed to be going, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck it.\\u201d I stand up and turn around and sit in the car facing the way I\\u2019m used to driving it. Then we start heading towards their hotel room in the city. The kids and I were closer to the beach on the outskirts, but now we\\u2019re heading into the city. I don\\u2019t want to be with my ex, his dad or his mom. I don\\u2019t want to be in this car. I don\\u2019t want to be in this city. All of this is so wrong. Now I\\u2019m driving facing the right way and I\\u2019m following the GPS but it\\u2019s taking me weird places. I\\u2019ve never driven in this area before. We go through residential areas and I drive on the wrong road but we make it through. Then at some point I\\u2019m like \\u201cFuck it, I\\u2019m not going to take this car because it\\u2019s going wrong places.\\u201d Now the GPS is saying, \\u201cOkay get out of the car and now you have to go on foot through all these places.\\u201d It\\u2019s still coronavirus times and there are all these weird things we have to do. Everyone else is wearing a mask but I\\u2019m not. At one point we are walking through a block party. I\\u2019m in the lead, but I can feel them behind me and the pressure to get it right and perfect is so intense. I\\u2019m getting frustrated because I don\\u2019t want to be there and I don\\u2019t want them to tell me what to do and I don\\u2019t want them to follow me and I don\\u2019t want to go to their hotel room deep in the middle of the city because they\\u2019re going to lecture me about some shit that\\u2019s not mine to do. I feel so much frustration. I\\u2019m taking a wandering meandering path. I walk through this block party and through somebody\\u2019s house. It\\u2019s a college kids party. I\\u2019m watching all the young college kids and can remember when I used to be like that and do that kind of shit and just be drunk as fuck. None of them are social distancing and I\\u2019m not either way. I walk through the house. I\\u2019m watching college girls in short skirts flirt. I don\\u2019t know if I see any guys at the party. I walk out the front yard and through another neighborhood. I\\u2019m walking down one road, but my ex\\u2019s dad is pointing up to one road that\\u2019s parallel to us - it\\u2019s like a freeway and there\\u2019s a chain link fence between that one and the one I\\u2019m on. He\\u2019s pointing up to that one like I\\u2019m supposed to be up on the freeway. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh fuck no, I\\u2019m not walking up there.\\u201d I just keep going. They\\u2019re following me somewhat reluctantly. At some point, our paths do diverge and they go off somewhere. They end up in front of me and I start following them. Now we\\u2019re walking through a designated green area and park in the inner city. There are all these trees. We\\u2019re downtown on a street with four lanes. We hit a stoplight. We\\u2019re walking. There are black people lined up on either side of this road, sitting on a bench that seems to go on forever. In the background is a park with trees. I\\u2019m just walking through and wondering if this is a safe place for us to be walking through because we\\u2019re a bunch of white people and they\\u2019re a bunch of black people. My ex father in law and mother in law are not the most savvy about anti-racism. I\\u2019m hoping they won\\u2019t talk. We walk through this area and get to this place where there is scaffolding on the sidewalk that they've put up to work on the buildings above the sidewalk. The scaffolding is really narrow and tight. There\\u2019s a man helping us get through it because at some point you have to crawl up and then shimmy your way through a tiny opening that\\u2019s all scaffolding. I can see through it but it's metal bars and tiny so a person bigger than me could not fit through. He looks sketchy with long greasy hair in a mullet. He looks like the character from Schitt's Creek that looks like a redneck. He\\u2019s helping me through this tight squeeze, then I see him help the others. I don\\u2019t know where the kids are. So I go through this scaffolding maze and we come out the other side. We reach the hotel they\\u2019re staying at. It\\u2019s a hotel that they used to live at but moved away from. They\\u2019re just staying at it now because they had to come get me and my ex so they could tell us off about something, I don\\u2019t know what. We go into the hotel. We go up to the floor they used to be on. The hotel is a bit shabby and I'm surprised that they used to live there. They take us up to this floor and the Golden Girls live on this floor with them along with some other people. It\\u2019s hilarious. The Golden Girls and some other people are out in the hallway where there are couches for gathering. The Golden Girls are talking and laughing with each other. They\\u2019ve just had dinner and there are plates, dishes and cooking knives everywhere. My ex father in law shoos everybody home and says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s late. It\\u2019s time for everybody to go home. None of you are wearing masks. Go on.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no, here it comes.\\u201d I see the Golden Girls leave and go to their rooms. I think they\\u2019re flirting with a bunch of older men who are residents here, too. They all go back to their rooms. I see my ex father in law pick up a huge chef\\u2019s knife and he starts to clean it and put it back. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThey always leave their stuff out.\\u201d He says it kind of fondly but also with exasperation. My ex mother in law has been making comments with him this whole time, but I\\u2019ve been ignoring them most of the time. I\\u2019m still wondering why I\\u2019m here and why I\\u2019m with these people of all people. What do they want? What does my ex want? My ex hasn\\u2019t been saying much this whole time. But all three of them are giving me this vibe like: \\u201cYou are fucking everything up. You are doing everything wrong. Now we need to get you and scold you and show you how it\\u2019s really done. And these are all the things you owe us.\\u201d I want out. The only time I had any control was when I was wandering through the block party and along the street with the black people - I knew I would be fine because I wouldn\\u2019t say something stupid. But now that we\\u2019re in this old hotel where we used to live and my ex father in law is cleaning this knife, I\\u2019m waiting for them to tell me what they\\u2019re needing to tell me. But that never happens and I don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re wanting to say.\"],[\"I\\u2019m with this older man in his 50s or so - he\\u2019s white with blonde curly hair like a surfer dude. His body is in shape, but since he\\u2019s 50 everything is not as firm. He has a wife, but we\\u2019re hanging out together. I don\\u2019t know what exactly we\\u2019re doing. We\\u2019re exploring some kind of weird relationship. The scene stays in mind of us in bed together. I\\u2019ve thrown the covers back to get out of bed and I\\u2019ve started my period. There\\u2019s a little bit of blood on the sheets. I\\u2019m wearing underwear, which is crazy because I don\\u2019t. There\\u2019s blood on the inside of the underwear and it has seeped through. I take the underwear off and go to take a shower. I\\u2019m sitting on the toilet and am rinsing the underwear in cold water. I see the words \\u201cBlockbuster\\u201d stamped on the inside of the underwear. I\\u2019m watching the blood disappear. I get up and come back to the bedroom and the man\\u2019s wife is there. We\\u2019ve both known he\\u2019s married and she\\u2019s fine with me being around. She\\u2019s older - their age is matched. I come back and she\\u2019s there. It\\u2019s like they\\u2019re caretaking me in a way. It feels strange. In another scene, my daughter is a toddler, 2 or 3 years old. She\\u2019s how she was as a baby - on me all the time. I feel like one part of me knows I need to let her be on me for attachment and all that, but another part of me is like, \\u201coh my gosh child, get off, I need to breathe.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much more to this dream, but it\\u2019s gone.\"],[\"I\\u2019m working with a friend and we\\u2019re having a meeting. She also has clients and we\\u2019re in her house. She\\u2019s showing them how she does some of her artwork - some of her painting. I\\u2019ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that\\u2019s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she\\u2019s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I\\u2019m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She\\u2019s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I\\u2019m wearing. I say, \\u201cThis is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.\\u201d It feels good between us - she\\u2019s my friend and my boss. We\\u2019re having a good time and I\\u2019m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We\\u2019re in the same house area, but now it\\u2019s my house. We\\u2019ve completed our work and she leaves. I\\u2019m realizing there\\u2019s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, \\u201cHey, there\\u2019s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I\\u2019m not going to get it to you this month.\\u201d I\\u2019m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It\\u2019s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I\\u2019m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven\\u2019t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t received your rent check this month. And I\\u2019ve heard that there\\u2019s a drone outside your house and I\\u2019m a little bit confused.\\u201d He\\u2019s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can\\u2019t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he\\u2019s saying is that there\\u2019s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It\\u2019s at the windows and it films me. I feel super violated - like my privacy has been violated. He\\u2019s really shaming about it even though I didn\\u2019t know there was a drone there. But his connection finally dies and I don\\u2019t hear him anymore. I go to call him back and try to get a hold of him so I can tell him I\\u2019m not paying rent. I hear him say something about there\\u2019s going to be an inspection. Then the connection is totally dead. I feel concerned because now I\\u2019m worried about this drone. I head back to the house. The house looks like a Victorain era dollhouse - it\\u2019s got one of those roundish rooms that reminds me of a tower and a lot of frill on the trim. I\\u2019m walking towards the house, but first I\\u2019m in the parking lot. There\\u2019s a parking lot and what looks like low income housing - they\\u2019re all one-story, the roof is flat, they\\u2019ve got a carport, and they\\u2019re all connected like apartments or a motel, actually. I see a friend of mine and she\\u2019s got a couple of kids. Then there\\u2019s a sheriff and he\\u2019s inspecting the place, but giving her an extra hard time. She has the front door open and her kids are running around. He\\u2019s telling her: \\u201cYour house looks dirty from outside.\\u201d He\\u2019s making her show him her car which also is dirty. He\\u2019s totally just giving her a hard time. I\\u2019m watching to make sure that he\\u2019s not just harassing her. It feels like he\\u2019s doing his job, but going out of his way to be a total asshole. Then he sees me and he heads towards my place, and he\\u2019s like: \\u201cYour house stinks. It smells, especially right here on the back porch area.\\u201d There\\u2019s actually another guy waiting for me on my porch. I recognize him as my lover - I think - but he doesn\\u2019t look like my type at all. He\\u2019s got blond hair and blue eyes. He\\u2019s kind of tall and it looks like he\\u2019s just come from a football game because he\\u2019s got his football gear and he\\u2019s really sweaty, stinky and smelly. But I guess this is my person because I\\u2019m really happy to see him. He\\u2019s standing on this porch where the law enforcement person is telling me it smells really bad. I look and I see there\\u2019s a window seat that juts out from the house over the porch a little bit. Underneath the window seat is one brown wool sock and one bottle of forgotten soda or something. But the foundation of this porch is all stone and is rotted - there\\u2019s moss and it\\u2019s black and the stone is crumbling. My lover is standing up there and he comes down and he greets me. He shushes the sheriff and we start to go into the house. But my brother shows up. He starts to dig out the stone that\\u2019s rotted. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it!\\u201d I know that the smell coming from it and whatever is under it is supposed to stay under, like it\\u2019s an old ancient curse or something - kind of like they bury vampires. I\\u2019m like: \\u201cDon\\u2019t go in there.\\u201d But my brother starts digging it up. Sure enough, there\\u2019s a body wrapped in chains. It\\u2019s folded in on itself. As soon as my brother gets the rock off, it unfolds itself and it\\u2019s a king. I\\u2019m horrified: \\u201cNow you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve just let the bad guy out.\\u201d Then I hear some other rock crumbling. I\\u2019m up in the tower place now because it has all the windows. I turn and from my vantage point, I see that the queen has been let out, too. She\\u2019s also been in chains. They both have gunk on them because they're so old. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cFuck, this is not good.\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to grab me and my lover - now we have to leave the house. Now we have to get down these stairs and past these things and out past the house. There\\u2019s a level of horror and also comedy because the queen is hideously ugly and she\\u2019s just bitching. She\\u2019s clearly very bad tempered and it\\u2019s a little bit cliche in that way. We\\u2019re coming down the stairs trying to avoid them and we do make it outside. I don\\u2019t know what happens to my lover - he disappears. I run into this 11 or 12 year old boy. He\\u2019s kind of playful and naughty - very much trickster energy. I can hear a voice that\\u2019s sort of narrating what\\u2019s happening with this queen and king coming out and this boy who is kind of teasing. He\\u2019s running off away from me and the queen and king are trying to follow him. I\\u2019m thinking that they\\u2019re the bad guys trying to catch this boy, but this voice that I\\u2019m hearing suddenly shows up. It\\u2019s a man with a troubadour hat with a feather and he\\u2019s dressed in stockings - like Shakespeare, old style. He\\u2019s got one of those frilly collars around his neck. It turns out he\\u2019s the one that either the king and queen are chasing, or he\\u2019s chasing the boy. I\\u2019m not sure. It\\u2019s a little convoluted. I just know it's time to get the hell out of there because whatever is happening is not my business. The house is a lost cause. I have no idea where my lover went. My brother is off - I don\\u2019t know where he went; he let these things out and now he\\u2019s gone. I\\u2019ve been heading towards a crowd, following this boy and watching things unfold and I just let myself get lost in the crowd.\\n\"],[\"I\\u2019ve been asked to start and run a restaurant. The bare bones of the restaurant are in place - there\\u2019s a kitchen and a place for people to eat and a menu that I created. But there\\u2019s no staff. I have to do the cooking, serving and cleaning up all at once. The people who are eating know this is an experiment. There are three tables of people. They\\u2019re all putting in their orders and are very expectant. It\\u2019s just me. And there\\u2019s one other person who\\u2019s watching me and helping me a little, waiting for my direction, but more observing. I\\u2019m panicked because there\\u2019s too much to do. There\\u2019s no way to cook and serve and clear the tables and get everyone\\u2019s order and fill the water glasses all at the same time. It\\u2019s just too much. I\\u2019m trying as hard as I can. Everything is white in this restaurant - white table cloths, white walls, white floor - and part of it seems outdoors, there is no ceiling. After the meal is entirely served and I\\u2019m all done, the tables have nothing but complaints about the service, the food and how terrible everything was. I look at them and am like, \\u201cYou all volunteered for this and you knew that it was just me and I said it was not going to do all the things. But you guys all wanted this and you did it anyway. And now you\\u2019re critiquing me for it when I told you it wasn\\u2019t possible for me to do everything and I would need help.\\u201d I was panicked and frustrated.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve come in off the streets - it\\u2019s a neighborhood, city-like feel with lots of people. It\\u2019s dark, not quite night. I go into a shop where I work. We sell lights - beautifully made unique chandeliers and light fixtures. There is also art on the wall. I work for an older woman in her fifties or early sixties. One of my duties is to clean up. The shop looks kind of dusty and the lights haven\\u2019t been cleaned in a while. There\\u2019s a lot of clutter everywhere on the counters and whatnot. Some of the clutter is mine that I\\u2019ve just left around. There\\u2019s a pair of jeans and a wet towel on the countertop. It\\u2019s just really messy. The relationship I have with this lady is familiar but not healthy. This asian man walks in and wants to buy a chandelier. He picks out one that has panes of green glass - the glass is cut into rectangles and squares. The woman is selling it specifically to him - it\\u2019s not like he has just wandered in. He has to decorate his elderly parents\\u2019 flat. He needs lights no matter what and is very consciously picking out the lights with the green tones. He thinks that his parents will like it. To him, it also has significance around healing and keeping them healthy. The owner of the shop is wrapping it up for him. I was in the back cleaning up the towel and that weird pair of jeans. There\\u2019s another chandelier that I was looking at earlier and showing the shop owner. It\\u2019s a longer chandelier - maybe five feet long - with thick brass or gold round tubes that hang down from the top where the light is. It also has a cascade of glass panels like the other one, but the panels are not blue and green, they are the colors of a pastel rainbow. I say something like, \\u201cThis is our unicorn chandelier.\\u201d I put it down while I was cleaning. It needed to be cleaned and it was definitely one of our more expensive pieces. While this asian man is being run up by the shop owner, I give him a tour of some of the other chandeliers. I get this hit that he needs another light. I show him this one chandelier and he\\u2019s gobsmacked in total awe. He doesn\\u2019t even ask the price. He doesn\\u2019t need me to tell him about it. He just knows that it\\u2019s his. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYes, of course. This is a beautiful piece of art and the healing properties within this one are even more than the one you\\u2019re buying.\\u201d So he takes it to the front to be run up as well. In the meantime, I\\u2019ve cleared out all of the junk from the shop, including all these wet towels that were on the countertops. If you look at the countertops, you can see the outline where the wet towels were. But now they\\u2019re gone. The chandeliers and art are no longer dusty. The dream ends with him taking the chandeliers, very pleased knowing that he\\u2019s going to put this light in his parents\\u2019 flat and they\\u2019re going to be so grateful. It feels like the relationship between me and the shop owner has improved now that things are cleaned and I upsold the chandelier to the Asian man. Suddenly we have an easier connection.\"],[\"I\\u2019ve dreamed about ninja turtles and movie stars\"],[\"I\\u2019ve had dreams of being in horror movies but it still takes place in my own neighborhood\"],[\"I\\u2019ve had dreams that I was in a star wars movie but it was me and my child.

My group was in a war with another group. They're leader was a skeleton on fire and we had to fight monsters. Most of them were not strong. There was just a lot of them. Darrell was on my team. Everyone was poor and living in horrible conditions. Our home was destroyed and we were fleeing to a train cart that looked like a camper. ? A black woman that was trying to save the groups baby had her legs almost burned completely to the point of being unuseable. I ended up killing the skeleton by knocking his head off and we waited for the followers to fall away and die off so we could rest. Then I think I woke.\"],[\"In my dream I was at work but it was different. We had to walk outside and there were different buildings but a lot of the same people. I was trying to get in the smaller of the two spaces that I work in. Two of my coworkers open the door. They were cleaning it and there was graffiti all over the walls and somebody had broken in and written all over the walls. I\\u2019m trying to review what it looks like but the writing was blue and purple I think it says something like \\u201cjeer.\\u201d And then I went to the other room with my coworker and there were people cleaning the room. We said hello and tried to jump on a phone call. The computer didn\\u2019t work so we were trying to use our phones and I felt like we were early but we were not and when we finally got on, the Meeting was ending. Then I walked back to the smaller office and realized there was a fence around the door. He turned around and one of the patients that should\\u2019ve been on the locked side was loose on my unlocked voluntary unit side. He was slamming and checking me against the fence and very physical. Security came and instead of taking him away, they kept body checking him over into the fence where I was against the fence and then eventually throwing him over on top of me. And when I walked out I suddenly didn\\u2019t have shoes on and I saw the security person from far away - not the one who was just body checking the guy against the fence but a different one. He didn\\u2019t help me but he looked concerned that he was pretty far away so I started walking towards the building where they were. I was confused and scared and felt exposed.\"],[\"In my dream I was flying in from Europe back to America for some kind of conference and everybody was supposed to be wearing masks but not a lot of people were and it was a really crowded conference in this one little room. All these materials were set out at all these places and we had to find activities. A lot of it looks like low function activities that I might bring for a low function OT group at work. I was trying to navigate in between these rows and there was no room to get in between them. People kept commenting on that. Then at some point I took a break from that dream and went to another dream. I was with my ex Rory and the dogs and we were running around the park, then just walking. This lady let her dog loose. One of Rory\\u2019s dogs, Trevor, isn\\u2019t friendly, so we were trying to keep him from hurting the dog and all the dogs got loose so we were chasing them up and around and climbing trees and then going up a tree. There was this group of people and this lady I knew a long time ago (somebody I\\u2019ve cut cords with in the past) and she was being irresponsible and just laughing while we were trying to save the dogs. Then I returned back to the other dream and I was trying to collect the materials I might need. Someone told me I should take this one thing and it was a picture with a cross on it to take to work. I went to go get that and tried to make my flight on time but I kept leaving and trying to return because I forgot something and was busy and cramped walking against the tide of people in the other direction. There is a friend from high school, \\u201cKaren,\\u201d and I haven\\u2019t talked to her in years. Then I woke up. Frustrated.\"],[\"In my dream I woke up and I was in my apartment but it was the inverse layout and the lights were on. There was nothing on the walls, except there was this strange out of place headless glass bust on top of the TV. It was so out of place.

Later in this dream a PT I work with called to ask how to get her driver\\u2019s license and I consulted with Rory for some reason and I was annoyed by this.

I went into her wardrobe and started pulling out clothes to wear. One dress reminded me of a favorite skirt I had a long time ago and I realized it was like a store - she has several sizes. She had all kinds of shoes in there and I remember seeing these weird foam flats that were labeled \\u201cspoonie shoes\\u201d and laughing in my dream because as a \\u201cspoonie\\u201d (someone with pain and chronic illness) I would wear these over the fun heels she had also brought with her.

My childhood home does have a stream in the backyard and this dream shows up in a lot of my dreams. The dream is a bit fragmented. I can\\u2019t quite grasp it. My father and I are standing in the backyard and looking down this short shallow hill to the stream. On the other side of the stream bed is a hill you can climb up and once you get to the top of that hill, you can look out over the land and see Mauna Kea and Haleakala and you can see the coast. The lava rock desert is on the other side of this hill and it is the actual landscape I grew up with and it is the landscape that shows up in this dream. So, I\\u2019m in the backyard with my father. I can\\u2019t remember what we are talking about. I remember asking him very specifically what my mother is going to do with the seven houses she owns before she dies. Is she going to sell them? Is there a trust fund? Is she going to give them to each of her kids? What is happening with them? He says, \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to sell them all before she dies.\\u201d I remember thinking, Why. Her whole point was that she wanted to own one house for each of her seven kids to bequeath to them. It surprises me that she\\u2019s going to sell them. As I\\u2019m speaking with my dad in the backyard, I\\u2019m looking down towards the stream. There\\u2019s a bunch of little girls. They look like me and my sister when we were growing up, and some of my friends. They\\u2019re all ranging in age between 5 and 7 and 9 and 12. They\\u2019re down at the part of the stream where we used to cross over. It was deep in some parts, but it was shallow enough in this part, so that if the stream wasn\\u2019t running really hard, we\\u2019d get our feet wet, but we could cross over and get to the other side. In the dream, there are pools. Some of the girls are playing in the water. I see myself wanting to go down there. This is the place where I see myself walking down there, but I\\u2019m also walking down there - a little bit of an observer, but also in it. We go down and it\\u2019s just play. It feels like there are fairies - very playful and very magical. It\\u2019s almost a little pocket or bubble of carefree. I don\\u2019t remember all of the conversations that happen between me and the girls - it\\u2019s not much because it\\u2019s mostly laughing and playing. My sister is there and this strikes me because my sister and I don\\u2019t have any sort of relationship and we\\u2019re barely in contact now. But we\\u2019re all in that spot playing. There are other pieces in the dream where I\\u2019m up in the house in my childhood home and my brothers are there. I don't remember what we\\u2019re saying or doing. What stands out the most is the conversation with my dad. Part of the conversation with my dad started because my grandma is also dying. So there seems to be this ending of my maternal line - at least their presence in this realm - and they are moving on to become ancestors in the dream. It\\u2019s not so much that I feel that I\\u2019m the one taking up the mantle. It\\u2019s more that I\\u2019m observing and watching. I\\u2019m not quite sure what the felt sense is.\"],[\"In the first part of the dream, I am teaching a yoga class and I took it over from another teacher. At first the room is full of people, mat-to-mat. It is a chaotic energy. I start teaching. Then I turn away and look back. There is only a scattering of people. Most everyone has left and their mats are abandoned in a haphazard way, overlapping each other. It\\u2019s odd and doesn\\u2019t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don\\u2019t even teach savasana. As I\\u2019m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she\\u2019s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I\\u2019m amazed she hasn\\u2019t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She\\u2019s still not breathing. Then I wake up.\"],[\"In the morning I dreamed that I was going like in a bus or minibus to a school and the protagonists of the movie \\u201cSixteen Candles\\u201d were there and we were like in London or Italy (because of the type of building around).\"],[\"Indiana Jones and the temple of doom but I\\u2019m the little Asian kid\"],[\"is very good\"],[\"It has been a few weeks.

I\\u2019m with my friend Emma and her partner. The two of them are showing me around the city. They\\u2019re showing me places where statues have been pulled down and things have been destroyed. All the things that have been destroyed are the white male patriarchy tributes to other white males. We\\u2019re in a park. The grass is still green - Gaia is doing just fine in the dream. But all things human-made are falling down and in disrepair. I see a lot of steel and metal that\\u2019s been pulled down. It\\u2019s all crooked and bent and broken in places. She\\u2019s telling me, \\u201cThey don\\u2019t see us and they don\\u2019t honor us. They don\\u2019t care for us and they don\\u2019t put us first. That\\u2019s why it all has to come down.\\u201d Then the dream shifts and I\\u2019m with my ex. His girlfriend is with him. She\\u2019s a younger blonde woman. I walk up to her and say, \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t met because this idiot has never introduced us. My name is Rose and I\\u2019m the mother of those two children over there.\\u201d The kids are in this part of the dream, too. We\\u2019re in a neighborhood. They\\u2019ve moved and they\\u2019re showing me their new house. I\\u2019m seeing where they live now so I can pick up the kids when it\\u2019s my turn. She\\u2019s actually quite easy to get along with and there's a good vibe between us. My ex is still annoying. He\\u2019s just combative with me. He\\u2019s trying to talk to me, but the tone in his voice is so condescending and really forceful. There\\u2019s no room for discussion with him. He\\u2019s just giving ultimatums. I\\u2019m not feeling like listening to that, so I ignore him as usual. I go over to see the kids. The kids are kind of squirrely. My son is happy to see me; my daughter, not so much. They\\u2019re both really clear that they want to live with their dad in this house that he and his girlfriend have. The house has swings in the front yard and a waterslide. There are lots of fun things to do here, so of course the kids are going to pick that. Then the scene shifts again. I\\u2019m in a downtown area in a community center. It\\u2019s run by people of color. It\\u2019s an education center where you can come learn about the different cultures and histories of other places. The history of the U.S. is also being taught, but it\\u2019s all the stuff we were never taught in school. It\\u2019s all the stuff that was not whitewashed and what is coming out now in real time about the history of the peoples here and how they were treated. The emphasis is on the culture. It\\u2019s all young women in this place, except for a few young men who are coming and going and some two-spirit or trans people. A young woman stops me. They are excited to show me all the stuff I never knew about their country and where they come from - their history, their roots. I\\u2019m having this crazy moment of realizing how little I do know and how exciting it is to observe these young people and absorb their love for their country and where they came from. I\\u2019m also excited to learn there is so much more to life than I thought. It\\u2019s fantastic and amazing. Instead of me feeling put upon or defensive, I\\u2019m very excited by this treasure trove of knowledge and that these people are so excited to teach. There are a few people within the community center who are a bit contemptuous of me and what they would call my ignorance. But overall, there is an excitement to share. Even though I\\u2019m the ignorant white woman, there is still tolerance because I'm there to learn and am excited to learn about all these things, especially the cultural aspects. At one point i pick up a wooden carving of India. What I notice is that unless the person hadn\\u2019t told me it was India, I wouldn\\u2019t have known what country it was. I had a moment of shame that I should have known what country this was. But I didn\\u2019t know and the shapes of the countries change all the time, so now I do know.\"],[\"It made me very worried about my loved one as it dealt with them.\"],[\"It may sound a bit deep, yet my most memorable dream was hearing my Dad cry in our bathroom. When I approached him in my dream, he was reluctant to say why he was crying. Eventually, he spoke how it was about tally marks on his tattoos. There was something wrong with them, apparently.\"],[\"It seems to me it was about violent looters. I don't remember much else.\"],[\"It starts with me riding in a car with my lover. He starts out very attentive, as he should be, then he gets high and checks out. I\\u2019m not so stoked about it because we are headed to the pole studio where I\\u2019m going to practice. I\\u2019m not sure if he was going to work out or practice. It is a pole studio/gym so there is a place for him to go workout. It\\u2019s important that he works out and trains because there\\u2019s something he\\u2019s training for. I am training, too. We get to the pole studio. Unlike the pole studio I practice at, which is light and bright, this studio is pretty dark. The poles are so tall that the tops disappear into darkness. It\\u2019s almost like the studio is as big as an amphitheatre. I have a nagging feeling. There are other people training, I don\\u2019t know who they are, but they\\u2019re all women. We get there and I realize this pole studio and workout facility is owned by Wendy. Wendy is a woman I had a crazy emotionally abusive relationship with and she is now an ex-friend of mine. Going to a place she owns is filling me with dread. The reason we were heading that way is because of quarantine, so she wasn\\u2019t there. She was also pregnant and out of the picture, so it was safe for me to go there. Now she\\u2019s no longer pregnant and quarantine is over and she shows up and starts being a total tyrant. She hasn\\u2019t seen me though, so I hide. I lay on the ground and the other women - some are younger, maybe 12 or so - all sit on top of me and do a dance. They\\u2019re like the goddess with lots of arms. They do one of those dances where each arm goes in succession. They\\u2019re sitting on me so you can\\u2019t see my body at all - I\\u2019m covered and hidden. Somehow Wendy sees me anyway. She makes them stand up and get off me so she can see me. She just starts yelling at me - \\u201cGet on the pole! Do the moves!\\u201d I can\\u2019t. I\\u2019m tired and I haven\\u2019t done pole in a long time, so I don\\u2019t have the strength I usually have. This is really hard and I\\u2019m feeling attacked without resources to defend myself, just out of my own fatigue and because my nervous system is shocked from being in her presence. She is a tyrant. She\\u2019s wearing a ballet bodysuit with one of those ballet skirts that go straight out. It looks funny on her because her body is very beefy. She\\u2019s barking orders at everyone. I feel so attacked and I really want to get out of there, but I can\\u2019t find my lover. He actually shows up, but he kind of fawns to her. She intimidates him, as well. The whole situation feels gross. One part of me is going, \\u201cOh my god, you\\u2019re not actually a victim, you could get out of this at any time.\\u201d But in the dream I\\u2019m being taken through this tyrant-victim dynamic and my lover is not defending himself because he\\u2019s high and he\\u2019s also not defending me. I\\u2019m upset about it. Then we have a dream shift. There\\u2019s a battlefield. I\\u2019m observing and not partaking in this part of the dream. Soldiers are coming in off the ocean. We\\u2019re on a beach. The ones coming in off the ocean have more primitive weapons, like lances. The soldiers maintaining the beach have guns and bombs. It\\u2019s a fucking slaughter. The ocean is red from blood. There are bodies floating everywhere and bodies on the sand. I know that the soldiers on the beach are Japanese. They come from the samurai background but are not using their samurai honor at all. Then as I\\u2019m observing, I pull back from the beach and am in a bunker. It has one window that I can see out of. There are a bunch of men - generals I think - sitting around a table and looking at a map. I\\u2019m not participating - I\\u2019m observing all of this. I look to my right and there is one window where you can see and hear the ocean. As I\\u2019m looking, a gigantic sneaker wave is coming right towards this bunker and is going to come right through this window. I think, \\u201cWhy would you build a bunker so close to the ocean. You have to know there are tides and the water can get you at any point. This is way too close to the water.\\u201d I just watch as this huge wave comes and covers the bunker. The bunker is concrete, so it\\u2019s not going anywhere, but the water that comes in the window is going to get everyone. The water gets up to the window, then the dream shifts. So I don\\u2019t actually see the water come into the bunker. I don\\u2019t see what happens to the rest of the fighting. The last impression I have is a lot of dead bodies. And it\\u2019s all men. The dream shifts and I\\u2019m on a school campus. I cross a bridge and go from the dorms which are in a forest. The forest is beautiful and the trees are not really big around. They are smaller and remind me of young eucalyptus trees. The bark is that creamy pale mixed with red. There is a lot of space, paths, fairy lights and lightning bugs. It\\u2019s pretty magical As soon as I cross the bridge everything changes and I can tell I\\u2019m in an academic setting. In front of me are buildings. People - professors and other college students - are coming at me. They\\u2019re hurrying here and there. To my right there is a stream or creek - it\\u2019s not a river. It\\u2019s this gorgeously stepped hillside that goes down. It\\u2019s not man made steps, just natural levels that go down. It\\u2019s emerald green - grass, moss and tiny moss flowers. The roots from trees make each level. I\\u2019m walking down towards the stream because I\\u2019m having an aversion to going to school or towards the college. I can actually see myself squatting next to the stream. I have a backpack on, but I really don\\u2019t want to go to school. I do meet with someone. There is a conversation, but I don\\u2019t remember what it is. I can see myself squatting down next to the water. This piece feels magical, like a continuation of the forest. There is a line where you can see you step into academia where it is grey and the energy is grey. I just don\\u2019t head that direction even though I need to - there is stuff I need to do and papers I need to write. Then the dream shifts again. I\\u2019m in a garden, the kind with well trimmed hedges that make a kind of labyrinth. I\\u2019m meeting this older woman with grey hair. She reminds me of Glenn Close when she played Cruella De Vil in \\u201c101 Dalmations\\u201d or in the movie, \\u201cThe Devil Wears Prada.\\u201d She\\u2019s totally a bitch and stalking around. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m her apprentice, but there\\u2019s some sort of power dynamic where I\\u2019m supposed to be doing things for her. I keep doing them wrong and I\\u2019m not wearing the right clothes. I get three tries. We meet together three different times. Each time I\\u2019m wearing a different outfit and I\\u2019ve brought something for her from a task I was supposed to complete. I don't remember what they were. What I do remember is that each time she sees my clothes, she\\u2019s so disappointed that I haven\\u2019t dressed the part and I don't look like her assistant or her apprentice. She says I look sloppy. She\\u2019s super verbally abusive the first two times. On the third time, I pop out and it\\u2019s not me as her apprentice. It\\u2019s someone else and I\\u2019m observing. This time I watch as she\\u2019s super physically violent with the woman who is her apprentice. She pushes her through a scratchy thorny hedge and then pushes her down into the water. The woman\\u2019s clothing is actually really lovely. She has white satin slingback high heels on and a nice coat and gloves. Each time she has met, the clothing has changed. This time, the Glenn Close character holds her down under the water and ruins the shoes and coat. I can tell there was no way this woman or me was ever going to do it right and this other woman is just crazy abusive. Then the dream switches again. I make music - I\\u2019m a music artist. I\\u2019ve made a song and it\\u2019s gone to be judged and given an award. I can clearly see recording equipment in front of me. I\\u2019m sitting on a couch and singing. As I sing, I splice in somebody else who is rapping, then I go back to singing. It\\u2019s very formulaic - a lot of songs on the radio sound like this. I am hearing the song in my head and don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s really special. It is very formulaic - just like what every producer puts out these days with collaborations between famous people, but don\\u2019t really mean a whole lot. The words aren\\u2019t really inspiring and neither is the melody or tune or anything. But I put it out and somehow I get an award for this piece. I\\u2019m sitting on this couch and the people who bring me the award are two young Japanese men who are apprenticed to a master. They are maybe in their twenties. I can see the master in the background, but the two that come, are men. They come one at a time. They are holding these gold statues of a record player. Their feet are shuffling as they approach me. They have it held out in front of them, then they bow and hand it to me. Someone is announcing in the background that I\\u2019ve won these awards. But I\\u2019m still on this couch where I can see through the walls and see the outside. I can actually see the doorframe that these Japanese men are walking through, but there are no walls on either side and the door frame itself is translucent - I can see through it. I can also see through the doorway because I can see them coming. So the first one comes and hands me the award and bows and leaves. Then the MC makes another announcement to say I\\u2019ve won another award. The second Japanese man comes shuffling towards me and bows with a lot of humility. So now I have these two awards. Then this other woman shows up. She looks like Lana del Ray, but a really young version of her. She goes, \\u201cI don't know why you won. Your song is not that good.\\u201d She plays me her song that was in the same category as mine. Her song is beautiful and her voice is beautiful - it\\u2019s haunting. However, it has the same formula. She sings, then somebody raps, then she sings and somebody raps. I\\u2019m going like, \\u201cYeah, why did my song win? Her song is way more beautiful than mine.\\u201d She goes, \\u201cI think you copied me. You just stole it.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWell, no, I definitely did not steal it. Mine is not even close to as good as yours.\\u201d It just feels like a strange thing. Those awards I won feel right. I did earn the awards according to the criteria. I did feel a sense of accomplishment. But when I compare it to what she\\u2019s created, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhoa, you definitely deserve awards for what you\\u2019re doing. I don\\u2019t understand why you didn\\u2019t get any.\\u201d So she comes at me with some competitive energy, but I am not feeling the competition. I agree with her. I think she should have won some awards.\"],[\"It turns out that our wood can help with the virus\\u2026.but we have to wait a while, for the process to go forward\\u2026.The piles of wood chips will change somehow, and that takes time\\u2026.\"],[\"It was a mix between the hunger games and world war 2.

Then I saw some other parts of the horse in the road. I looked at its eyes, its eyes were sad and red.\"],[\"It was dark, I was not me, I was an African-American woman and her daughter. I was both of them. The story played twice. I was one of them each time. There is a house we went to for safety and I think it was supposed to be a grandmothers\\u2019 house. There were old school hair mirrors on the vanity table. One night we left and it seemed like it was part of a wild game preserve or Safari or something - I don\\u2019t have a reference point for. They were giving tours at night to school children, I think. We weren\\u2019t supposed to be there so we stayed alongside the underpart where they couldn\\u2019t see us in the shadows. I remember holding onto the crumbling side of dirt and rocks and looking up. You could see the stars and you could see the man, hoping he could not see you. If you got out far enough you were free but it was dangerous like a desert. It was daytime in the desert and you could see it. The first time we went, I was the mom. I tried to hide behind a tree but he saw her and we had to get on our knees. Somehow we got away. The second time we did the same story and I was the daughter and we were much more clever.

I think I said something clever and mean, and I left something on the table. Later, I had to go back and retrieve something from a dark brick one-story building, I wasn\\u2019t supposed to be there. Somehow I got caught and the package opened and then all these people came out of the ground but they were duplicates of the same set of people, replicating over and over and over again, and then more started walking out of a school bus.

They live in a completely different state, but there she was and she was in the group). She went back to her room and a nurse came to tell me that she died in her sleep, but that it did not look like suicide (that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re always worried about at work). It looks like she just went to bed and fell asleep and died. Somebody said she was done with caregiving and she had nothing left.\"],[\"It was night. I was invited to work offsite and someone (a colleague from NYC a decade ago) came to bring me there but I wasn\\u2019t able to navigate the muddy road in my shoes. We tried to go another way but there was a large stone gate covered in green moss. I told them to go ahead without me. Then, it was dark and I was in a city (maybe San Francisco) and trying to find my way home. I found a dog and tried to return it to this house and it was a dog rescue. They asked if I wanted cats, too. I am allergic but said I would meet them. They tried to get me to take three cats and I remember feeling scared that they weren\\u2019t declawed (in real life I don\\u2019t know enough about it but my sister has a cat and thinks declawing isn\\u2019t humane). In the dream there was a dog who came with us and we left the cats. I kept thinking about my ex\\u2019s dogs because I consider them mine and wondering if they would get along. I kept doing the math that it would be three dogs total (but it would be four). This dog was about 30-40 pounds with reddish golden hair like one of the goldens, Chuck. He came home with me and my dog Pinto. In my building we are only supposed to have one dog so I was worried about being caught, but knew my dog Pinto would be happier and wouldn\\u2019t howl when I left (he\\u2019s been doing that lately) because now he would have a friend.

I wonder if I\\u2019m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they\\u2019re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They\\u2019re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest.

This time I\\u2019m in a flat that I rent with a bunch of other people. We\\u2019re in school again. My high school classmate Connie is one of my roommates in this apartment that I\\u2019m in. There are four other roommates and they\\u2019re all men and they\\u2019re really rowdy. It\\u2019s nighttime and also bedtime, so I\\u2019m trying to sleep. All of the beds are in the living room; it\\u2019s not like we have separate bedrooms to go to. The dudes are all wired, they\\u2019re totally super high energy. But I\\u2019m super tired and wanting to go to sleep. Connie is wanting to go to sleep. She\\u2019s kind of fussing over me, trying to make sure I\\u2019m okay. The guys are bouncing around the living room, fighting and wrestling with each other and getting kind of nasty and obnoxious and drinking. I\\u2019m trying to fall asleep on my bed. Even though it\\u2019s my apartment and my place of rest, I feel like a guest, especially with the way Connie is fussing over me and making sure I have all the things I need. She\\u2019s going out of her way to explain the other roommates\\u2019 behavior. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah, Rose, we see you, we see you\\u2019re sleeping, but we can\\u2019t help ourselves, so you\\u2019re just going to have to deal with it.\\u201d There\\u2019s an air of \\u201ctough shit.\\u201d I\\u2019m lying down and next to my bed is a screen that separates my bed from all the other beds. It\\u2019s a light colored pine wooden screen with slats. I get a phone call from James, one of my roommates from this dream. In real life James is a friend of a friend who I just went camping with. I like him a lot - he\\u2019s a very soft spoken person and in his day job he works with conflict resolution and has the biggest heart and is so kind. In the dream, he\\u2019s calling me to check up on me and make sure I\\u2019m okay with all the noise and violence. There\\u2019s an undercurrent of violence and threat of sexual harassment. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNot really. I don\\u2019t feel comfortable or safe to sleep, that\\u2019s for sure.\\u201d The dream shifts out of this flat and goes outside. It\\u2019s still dark outside - this eerie green darkness that comes before a thunderstorm or tornado. I can see James in the distance and he\\u2019s with other people. It\\u2019s his wedding - he\\u2019s engaged in real life and they were supposed to be married this year, but they\\u2019re pushing the wedding off to next year because of coronavirus. It\\u2019s not a bright sunny wedding. I can't hear what\\u2019s going on. I can just see James and the people moving in the distance. I\\u2019m watching and I have this feeling of melancholy and curiosity.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark and crowded. I\\u2019m running away and trying to escape before Ursula finds me. She\\u2019s looking for me in the crowds. I can tell she wants to harm me. There is a conference and gathering of people dressed in futuristic clothes, all in black with coats. Somebody lets me borrow their big puffy black coat to help hide me. I put this on. There is a row of people who tell me I can blend in with their group. I think it will be a solution to sit in that row with them. Before the conference starts, I go to the bathroom. Ursula and Gemma walk in right behind me. They don\\u2019t see me and I slip into a stall. But Ursula steps into the stall next to me, to my right. Gemma continues to wait in line and I don\\u2019t know how to escape without her seeing me. I think I wait until they both use the other stall because there are only two stalls. I think it\\u2019s safe so I go out, but they are washing their hands. Gemma sees me, though. I join the row of people who told me I could hide with them, but Ursula spots me. I escape the conference center in my big puffy black coat. I go down the street to a small house where I see a boy digging in the dirt with a shovel and pale. His mom is standing on the porch. She offers to help hide me.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. I\\u2019m meeting a group of friends at a closed coffee shop for a Gaelic language lesson. I\\u2019m at the door and talking about a book I\\u2019d like to show to Justine. Justine is waiting at the door with another book, but her face is partially obscured and I didn\\u2019t recognize it was her. We walk into the coffee shop and sit at a table next to the door. It\\u2019s drafty and I want to move to another table. I look over and see a big round table that looks like it has been prepared for us. There are pink frosted pastries at each chair. The frosting is uniquely created for each person. We move over to the other side of the coffee shop, but instead of sitting at the round table, we sit at chair-desks. Then somehow, I look away and look back and it\\u2019s no longer just a line of desks, but multi-leveled bleachers packed with a huge choir. People are dressed in robes. Each section has a sectional choir leaders because it is such a large group. They\\u2019re performing Handel\\u2019s Messiah.\"],[\"It\\u2019s dark out. It\\u2019s evening time. I am walking around a college campus. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who\\u2019s with me, but it\\u2019s another woman. I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She\\u2019s beautiful. She\\u2019s a little bit sad - she\\u2019s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she\\u2019s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it\\u2019s like an artist studio. It\\u2019s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She\\u2019s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there\\u2019s not much room. We\\u2019re hanging out with her and I\\u2019m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn\\u2019t even have a bathroom and I don\\u2019t think it has a kitchen area - it\\u2019s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She\\u2019s still really, really sad. I\\u2019m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she\\u2019s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend\\u2019s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There\\u2019s a little tension between them, like a depression. They\\u2019re together but they\\u2019re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don\\u2019t know why. They\\u2019re talking and there\\u2019s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it\\u2019s going to be fine - let\\u2019s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it\\u2019s full dark now. There\\u2019s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He\\u2019s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he\\u2019s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He\\u2019s kind of got a belly. He just doesn\\u2019t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there\\u2019s other college kids lingering around. There\\u2019s stuff happening and I\\u2019m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I\\u2019m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It\\u2019s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don\\u2019t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they\\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\\u2019s very orderly. It\\u2019s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they\\u2019re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it\\u2019s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I\\u2019m watching these people come and go and there\\u2019s this competitive energy in me where I\\u2019m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It\\u2019s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There\\u2019s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who\\u2019s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That\\u2019s the atmosphere that we\\u2019re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We\\u2019re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There\\u2019s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there\\u2019s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it\\u2019s mine. But he\\u2019s holding the baby and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOh, I sort of like holding the baby.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don\\u2019t say anything but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYes, we should do that.\\u201d I\\u2019m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we\\u2019ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we\\u2019re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He\\u2019s in a costume of some sort and he\\u2019s asking me if I recognize who he is. I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s familiar but I can\\u2019t quite place it.\\u201d Somebody says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your gloves.\\u201d And he says, \\u201cOh yeah my gloves!\\u201d Then I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, your Hans Solo!\\u201d He runs off to get his gloves and I\\u2019m still somehow totally content because we\\u2019re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he\\u2019s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There\\u2019s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he\\u2019s at least 10 years younger - which is why I\\u2019m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it\\u2019s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he\\u2019s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I\\u2019m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It\\u2019s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I\\u2019m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I\\u2019m not exactly sure what we\\u2019re doing, but we\\u2019re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I\\u2019m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it\\u2019s a spaceship. It\\u2019s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they\\u2019re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I\\u2019m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they\\u2019re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I\\u2019m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I\\u2019m starting to be crushed. So I\\u2019m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I\\u2019m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It\\u2019s me and my friend, Aila. We\\u2019re in a car together, traveling. It\\u2019s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There\\u2019s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it\\u2019s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He\\u2019s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He\\u2019s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don\\u2019t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he\\u2019s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it\\u2019s the sample. It\\u2019s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that\\u2019s made out of gold and it\\u2019s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who\\u2019s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there\\u2019s something up with these bracelets because the material they\\u2019re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, we all need one of these.\\u201d He\\u2019s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it\\u2019s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that\\u2019s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he\\u2019s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there\\u2019s more, but that's all I can remember right now.\"],[\"It\\u2019s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I\\u2019m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It\\u2019s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it\\u2019s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I\\u2019m going in and out of groups and shops. I\\u2019m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it\\u2019s a shop or someone\\u2019s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I\\u2019m not sure. I leave and walk out. I\\u2019m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I\\u2019m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I\\u2019m hovering - I\\u2019m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don\\u2019t see me. They\\u2019re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m standing there, but I\\u2019m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they\\u2019re not seeing me. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a lake or the ocean. There\\u2019s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It\\u2019s all outdoors. As I\\u2019m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I\\u2019m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I\\u2019m telling them, \\u201cYes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great\\u201d because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I\\u2019m not going to get any of them because I\\u2019m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They\\u2019ve gotten their cheese and now they\\u2019re at the wine bar ordering wine. I\\u2019m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, \\u201cWe actually have work to do.\\u201d There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There\\u2019s a hose right there. She says, \\u201cI have all these things I have to clean.\\u201d I say, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I\\u2019ll help you clean these things.\\u201d So we\\u2019re scrubbing containers and tubs. I\\u2019m doing all the scrubbing and she\\u2019s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She\\u2019s really sad. I\\u2019m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn\\u2019t doing a whole lot. She\\u2019s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I\\u2019m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I\\u2019m just doing the motions. There\\u2019s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.\"],[\"It\\u2019s hard to remember as it was two or three weeks ago now but it did involve me and my family getting the virus while quarantined together\"],[\"It\\u2019s just sort of a grey light. There are people sitting in chairs spaced for social distancing and scattered around. Somebody is sitting up front pointing an old wrinkled finger at people. Each time the finger points, the person is recognized as empathetic and kind. This finger is pointing at each of the people in chairs. As the finger gets to me, they hesitate. I see Jeremy sitting up there with the old one and he whispers to him, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t point to her.\\u201d It\\u2019s really unsettling and disturbing to me. The old one\\u2019s finger does point to me and recognizes me as kind. I wonder why Jeremy is so bent on seeing me otherwise.\"],[\"It\\u2019s me and another woman who\\u2019s older than me, a white lady who I don\\u2019t know. I actually don\\u2019t know anyone in this dream. We both have an idea for a program we want to put together for others, and they\\u2019re slightly different. We\\u2019re supporting each other in getting it out into the world. Suddenly when we\\u2019re in a restaurant or gathering hall. There\\u2019s a guy who\\u2019s an MC and also really schmoozy and slimy. There are suddenly a lot of other people in this hall. There are tables where food is being served. The food is being catered. Me and this woman are sitting on a couch off to the side, in a lounge area. The guy is on the stage and he\\u2019s pitching our ideas to the audience. He\\u2019s trying to pitch each project separately for people to invest in them. All of sudden he starts having the people compete and choose one project or the other. He\\u2019s leaning a lot towards the older woman and her program, I think because there are enough similarities in our programs that he decides there should just be one. I\\u2019m sitting in the lounge on the couch and I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cYup, that\\u2019s fine. Don\\u2019t worry about it. You do your program and I\\u2019ll figure out something else to do. I actually don\\u2019t want any part of this because it feels gross. You go ahead and do your thing.\\u201d His presentation ends and the dinner ends. The people leave. I go from being someone who\\u2019s having an idea pitched to the help. I am now cleaning and clearing the tables. The bartender is still there and there are a couple others of us trying to clean and clear the tables. The bartender is like, \\u201cHey, leave the silverware but take any extra food.\\u201d There are these lettuce-wrapped sandwiches and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cTake any of those that are extra and put them in my fridge.\\u201d I keep picking them up in my bare hands. They aren\\u2019t even on a plate. They\\u2019re lettuce with turkey, tomato, cheese and mayonnaise on the inside. They\\u2019re sliding all over the place because they\\u2019re warm at this point. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYup, come put them in my little bar fridge.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little bar fridge and it\\u2019s overflowing and I keep dropping the sandwiches and they\\u2019re opening up and making a mess. He\\u2019s kind of starting to bitch at me. I\\u2019m kind of confused because it seems very unsanitary, but he wants to use them for the next dinner I guess. I don\\u2019t know what to do except keep grabbing the sandwiches and giving them to him. He\\u2019s so rude and abrasive and controlling that I\\u2019m also a little bit afraid of him.\"],[\"It\\u2019s my birthday or some celebration. I\\u2019m being celebrated and I\\u2019m with some friends. One is my sister-in-law. There\\u2019s a whole celebration planned for me. Dinner is going to happen later. But first, there is shopping for swimsuits. It\\u2019s curious because I actually found a swimsuit that I like - at least I like the colors and the cut of it. But the top is a little bit funny. So we\\u2019re going to a shop to look for other swimsuits. This shop is gorgeous - it\\u2019s totally open and I can see the ocean and palm trees in the background. I can hear the wind rustling through the palm trees. It feels tropical or at least it\\u2019s warm. I go into this shop and there\\u2019s big windows. It looks a little like a plantation, so it\\u2019s a bit old-fashioned, but updated. The floors are wood and there\\u2019s chandeliers for lights. The shopkeeper is a woman who looks familiar to me, but I don't think I know her. It\\u2019s me and my sister-in-law and another old friend from high school, Connie, who almost never shows up in my dreams, so it\\u2019s interesting that she\\u2019s there. We\\u2019re going through the swimsuits and they are gorgeous. They\\u2019re sort of a cross between swimsuits and lingerie because the bottoms don\\u2019t cover a whole lot adn the tops are see-through in parts. They have rhinestones and they\\u2019re made of lace or a mesh netting. Some are regular swimsuit materials. They are all in different colors - black ones with sequin embroidery, blue ones with gemstones on the front. I want to try all of them on even though I already have this swimsuit on. This swimsuit I have on is cute - a salmony pink color with orange and teal and mint green accents. It looks good, except that the triangle top has layers of ruffles. I hear myself say, \\u201cI don't like this top because it makes my tits look huge.\\u201d So I\\u2019m trying on these other swimsuits, but while the bottoms all fit, none of the tops fit me - they\\u2019re all too small and they don\\u2019t fit over my back. My back is too big and I\\u2019m having a hard time pulling the tops over or getting them to stay on. It\\u2019s making me sad because some of these are really gorgeous and my sister-in-law and my friend Connie are trying them on. They look great on them. We keep picking out the same swimsuits to try on. This takes a while. It\\u2019s almost like when you go try on wedding dresses and they serve you champagne. I\\u2019m not drinking anything because I don\\u2019t like to drink, but my friends are having some and there\\u2019s chocolate. It\\u2019s quite the experience. This whole time I am aware that even though we\\u2019re trying on these swimsuits, it\\u2019s time and then past time for me to go to this dinner that\\u2019s been arranged. We\\u2019re all late for the dinner. Eventually I just say, I\\u2019m good with the swimsuit I have. The two girls buy their own. The woman who's doing the shopkeeping is quite gracious. She\\u2019s an older lady in heels and a pencil skirt. We\\u2019ve kept her past her closing time, but she\\u2019s still gracious. Then we go to dinner and dinner, indeed, has started. It\\u2019s a long, long banquet table. As we walk up to it, I can see that it\\u2019s long and there\\u2019s a lot of people. I\\u2019m not entirely sure who all is sitting at the table, but I know them. They are definitely ready to celebrate me, so I\\u2019m walking up to the table and am feeling a little overwhelmed like there\\u2019s a lot of pressure and I\\u2019m late. Everyone is eating and I take a moment and order my first appetizer. I haven\\u2019t even sat at the table. I stand up and order it from the server that comes. Then at some point I\\u2019ve been crying or something has happened because all of the makeup on my face has been wiped off. So instead of sitting at the table, I walk around the side of this building that my dinner is being served at. It\\u2019s interesting because this long long table is out on a lanai. I can hear the wind through the palm trees and ocean and it\\u2019s warm out. We\\u2019re all in pants and rolled up long sleeves. We\\u2019re not bundled up by any means. So I walk around the corner of this building on the lanai and I can see a bunch of windows. I can see into the kitchen where everything is being prepared. It\\u2019s totally cool because there\\u2019s a huge kitchen, super light and airy with maybe 15 people working. There's a head chef. I\\u2019m looking in the window and also at my reflection in the window, seeing that my makeup needs to be fixed. I have my makeup bag in my purse and start fixing it. I\\u2019m watching the server come back and tell people what I ordered. Now I\\u2019m watching a salad cook prep. The head chef is standing right there - they\\u2019re closest to me right on the other side of these windows. The people inside are all a twitter - they keep saying, \\u201cThe queen is here! We\\u2019ve seen the queen!\\u201d They\\u2019re referring to me. I\\u2019m kind of giggling. The head cook looks up and he sees me on the other side of the window. Then the other people in the kitchen see me. They don\\u2019t register that I'm the queen and they\\u2019re being kind of cute with how excited they are. I\\u2019m laughing a little, seeing how excited they are. The head chef is the only one who realizes who it is. I\\u2019m watching as they make my salad. It\\u2019s a gorgeous salad and there\\u2019s a gorgeous vegetable platter that goes with it and it looks delicious. Then the head chef and I make eye contact. He recognizes who it is and starts to get everybody else to be a little more professional. He says, \\u201cWell, the queen is right here.\\u201d They all stop and gape at me, then go back to what they\\u2019re doing. I laugh and finish putting on my makeup and go back out to the dinner. Some time passes. The dinner happens. One of my brothers and a friend I\\u2019ve known since I was 7 - his name is Dorian but we call him Johnny - they go to escort me to a ball. It is dark now. There's lights on in the buildings and twinkle lights strung between trees. They\\u2019re escorting me from the lanai where the dinner was to where the ball is going to be. Johnny is so tall. In this dream he is probably at least 6 inches taller than he is in real life and he\\u2019s taller than me. He\\u2019s just really strong and big. I\\u2019m a little bit surprised because I know he doesn\\u2019t actually look like that and I\\u2019m also relieved because he\\u2019s playing a role of protector, like Captain of the Guard. Then there\\u2019s my brother who\\u2019s taking me along and making sure all goes well as I walk between the dinner and the ball. I\\u2019m noticing the warm breeze blowing off the ocean and the moon is out. It\\u2019s balmy and beautiful. It\\u2019s so lovely that I feel my heart is bursting because of how gorgeous it is out at night. It feels very comforting to have this super tall friend of mine and my brother on either side of me escorting me to the next place that I\\u2019m going. Then the dream shifts completely and the snippet from one piece I remember is I\\u2019m at my home. I know it\\u2019s my home and I own it. I\\u2019m in the yard. There are so many plants I recognize and they\\u2019re all plants I love. There\\u2019s three lilac bushes that are planted. There\\u2019s hollyhocks growing behind me, in front of the window. You can look into the window and see my living room. I\\u2019m relieved that the hollyhocks are there. There\\u2019s lavender and a bunch of medicinal plants - so all the herbs you need for keeping yourself safe and healthy. To my right hand side is my neighbor\\u2019s house and it\\u2019s kind of run down and derelict looking. There\\u2019s an RV sitting in their driveway. It\\u2019s brown and looks like a turd - not my favorite and I can feel that I\\u2019m not excited that I can see it. Back in my garden where I can see all these gorgeous plants and trees growing, I can see a space where maybe a cluster of five pine trees that have been cut down completely. You can see the tops of the stumps and they look kind of new. But part of them rotted and I know that those trees had to be cut down because they were rotting somehow. But I\\u2019m upset because I don\\u2019t like seeing trees cut down and it\\u2019s ugly. My yard is gorgeous except for this one spot where these trees have been cut down. Then I\\u2019m talking to the neighbor woman on the other side of me. There\\u2019s a fence between me and her. It\\u2019s a cul de sac, so I can see her driveway because everything curves. She\\u2019s trying to give me ideas of what to do with this area where it\\u2019s been cut down. I can imagine myself putting a picnic table on top of these stumps because they\\u2019re all the same height. So I\\u2019m imagining a picnic table and lights strung for gatherings. But this whole section of the dream, I feel a little bit out of place and somewhat agitated, in contrast to when it was my birthday and I was the queen.\"],[\"It\\u2019s night. I\\u2019m downtown in an urban environment that I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It\\u2019s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There\\u2019s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I\\u2019m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn\\u2019t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it\\u2019s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn\\u2019t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren\\u2019t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.\"],[\"It\\u2019s twilight feeling. I\\u2019m observing a couple of people - two men who I have a feeling of affinity or affection for, or maybe there is a familial tie. There\\u2019s a young girl that we are responsible for, or taking care of. I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s a daughter or younger sister, but she\\u2019s important and it\\u2019s imperative that we keep her safe. There\\u2019s a gathering of people. We\\u2019re trying to find her a coat to keep her warm. We set her up so she\\u2019s in one spot and she gets her coat. She\\u2019s trying on coats. We are outdoors and it\\u2019s cold. We snag a coat from a rack of coats. There\\u2019s something so special about this girl. She has a light shining from the inside. Everything around us is twilight and dull looking and dirty, but she\\u2019s not that. She\\u2019s a brighter light. So we get her this coat and make sure she\\u2019s warm. One of the men feels like she\\u2019s adequately protected in this little area that she\\u2019s in. So he leaves her for a second so she can get a sense of autonomy. He and the other man - I think they are brothers - are closeby. But they don\\u2019t exactly have their eyes on her because she disappears and they start to panic. Someone tells them that the last time they saw her, she was in a shop with pretty clothes. It\\u2019s an old-fashioned shop - Victorian Era - with all the details on the outside of the building and large ceilings. It\\u2019s definitely a high-end shop from that period. I go inside and am observing as the brothers go inside where these people last saw the girl. They\\u2019re interviewing the shopkeeper. She\\u2019s a woman who only speaks French and she\\u2019s got very well-tailored bespoke clothing on, old fashioned jewelry that looks like costume jewelry, but is real - huge oval-shaped diamond earrings with emeralds all the way around. The place itself exudes high class sophistication. This is where the young girl was last seen because the front room of the shop - the showing area - is windows from floor to ceiling and it\\u2019s also an alcove that juts out into the street so that people can see what\\u2019s being sold in the shop. If you see the mannequins in the front, you can look past and see these tall mirrors where people can look at themselves where they try on clothes. But it\\u2019s all on display so people walking by can see in. So definitely, there\\u2019s a sense of expensiveness being on display or shown - if you can go in that shop, then clearly you have money. So the men go in and ask the proprietor about the young girl. I can see that the young girl had been there and the woman had shown her a few pretty dresses, But the young girl\\u2019s interest was in a pair of earrings that were really stones, very shiny and rather big, even though the young girl didn\\u2019t have her ears pierced. The woman says she gave the earrings to the girl.Then the girl comes out from somewhere in the store. The men are relieved that she\\u2019s there. They bundle her up and take her away. I can tell that was a doppelganger - that wasn\\u2019t the real girl. As I watch the men leave, I look at the proprietor's face and has this weird smug look. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no. That was not it. She\\u2019s got this girl somewhere and she\\u2019s doing something to her.\\u201d So the woman who owns the shop leaves the front area and heads through a door and down some back stairs to a basement. I\\u2019m following her. Again, she doesn\\u2019t know I\\u2019m there, so I\\u2019m still just observing. We get down to the bottom of the stairs. It\\u2019s a production area where the clothes are sewn. She has a lot of young women working for her. The conditions look okay, but there\\u2019s definitely this air of her being in charge and they\\u2019re working for her. Things look pretty clean, but I get the sense she\\u2019s not paying them very much, if at all. They\\u2019re filling the role of slave. This is the part in the dream where I start to poke around because I have the feeling that she has that young girl locked up somewhere down in this basement area. There\\u2019s one door for me to look through. But the dream ends, because I never find the girl. I\\u2019m left with the sense that the girl is down in the basement in some kind of dungeon room or closet. She\\u2019s locked up and this woman is evil.\"],[\"its good in general\"],[\"Jack n Sally on the swirly hill super happy for saving Christmas n Halloween\"],[\"Just a few snippets of dream: one is an outside battle of sorts happening. There\\u2019s some forces that are trying to wipe me and my companions out. I\\u2019m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I\\u2019m responsible as I\\u2019m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it\\u2019s a general feeling of protecting, but I\\u2019m not sure who I\\u2019m protecting. It\\u2019s not anyone in particular, it\\u2019s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don\\u2019t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don\\u2019t even know what's coming for us, I\\u2019m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we\\u2019re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that\\u2019s coming towards us. So whatever it is that\\u2019s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn\\u2019t last. As the battle continues, it\\u2019s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can\\u2019t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don\\u2019t know and his friend who I also don\\u2019t know. The first group I\\u2019m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they\\u2019re getting a tour of a ranch. I\\u2019m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also has an herb garden where they\\u2019re allowed to gather some herbs as souvenirs. I am down there with them. There\\u2019s chives or green onions that we\\u2019re growing but they\\u2019ve dried somehow. So you can pick them up and take the dried chives with you. There\\u2019s also lemongrass and a bunch of herbs and people are able to gather them. I\\u2019m gathering them and working the ranch - that\\u2019s my role. I\\u2019m part of the tour but I also have work to do on this ranch to keep it going. The man is the owner of the ranch and there are a ton of other people who work on the ranch with separate roles. There\\u2019s a bookkeeper and all these other people that I don\\u2019t know who have roles and do a lot of planning for the tours or parties that come through, they do this man\\u2019s finances and just sort of run things for him. I\\u2019m mostly a little worker bee out on the land. So this group of people comes and goes and I'm getting the feeling this is a regular stop on a tour. Then the scene shifts a little bit from daytime to evening. The man is in the carriage thing and he asks me to go for a ride with him. His friend is driving the carriage. I get in and we head down the driveway like we\\u2019re going to leave the ranch. There's a place where the road turns and on the right hand side there\\u2019s a huge mud pit. You can see old tire tracks in it, but I\\u2019m really concerned because if the carriage falls into this mud pit, it is never coming out. I\\u2019m watching the friend struggle a little bit. He\\u2019s really close to the edge and I\\u2019m concerned. He has all my attention even though this other man who I\\u2019m sitting in the carriage with doesn\\u2019t seem to be concerned at all. He\\u2019s keeping a conversation going with me and I have one mind on the conversation with him and one mind on the fact that this carriage could get really stuck and fall off into the gigantic mud pit. I finally say something to this man and he says not to worry. At this point, the carriage turns itself around so I can see the entrance of the ranch with this big sign. It dawns on me that the whole reason for the driver to have been going so close to the mud pit was a distraction technique so that I wouldn\\u2019t turn behind me and see what they were doing to the sign on the ranch. When the driver finally does turn the carriage around, I see the sign on the ranch and it\\u2019s a marriage proposal from this man in the carriage. I\\u2019m so confused because this man is essentially my boss all the time and we don\\u2019t have any relationship that I know of and all the people that work for him have been changing out this sign and preparing this whole thing. I\\u2019m a little bit speechless and really confused and thinking that there\\u2019s another person this man would rather be with. I remember sort of sitting in the carriage going: \\u201cWell let\\u2019s try some things out and see how we work together.\\u201d\"],[\"Just have bad dreams PTSD\"],[\"Just the world being really bad and the stock market crashed\"],[\"Just things about people dying and starving to death\"],[\"Last night I dreamed I was going to go get some lasagna.

Mary is there and she\\u2019s helping me find this. Then other things happen that I can\\u2019t recall. I\\u2019m on a walk along the coast with a group of people. Ursula is in the front and I\\u2019m pretty sure Mary is still with me along with other people. We\\u2019re walking along a narrow path to a festival. I look over at the ocean and it\\u2019s the most beautiful coastline. I\\u2019ve been there before in dreaming life but I don\\u2019t recognize it from waking life. Every time I see it, I am thrown into pure joy because of the beauty. It\\u2019s the most beautiful blue you\\u2019ve ever seen - it\\u2019s one little sunny protected coastline without big waves. The water flows smoothly in and out. I throw my arms up in pure ecstasy at the beauty of this landscape. Ursula looks back at me with a judgmental smirk and keeps walking ahead, but it doesn\\u2019t change how I feel about this beautiful place on earth. Then we arrive at the festival and I put my bag and shoes down. In doing this, I lose everybody and I\\u2019m suddenly alone in a big crowd of people. At first I\\u2019m not concerned, but the day goes on towards night. I don\\u2019t have my bag, money or shoes and I don't know what I\\u2019m going to do for the night. There\\u2019s a beautiful wading pool where people go to bless and cleanse themselves after their journey. I see a young man I recognize from chiropractic school in waking life. He\\u2019s very kind and he\\u2019s with me. We find a little spot to lie down and rest for the night. In the morning, they start breaking down this entryway to the festival. I tell them about my missing bag and shoes. The guy is really helpful and is looking on the upper and lower levels. He says he thinks he saw my shoes and may have seen my backpack, too. He\\u2019s looking for me and telling other people to help me look. But they don\\u2019t find either thing. I decide to go on and know I\\u2019ll find the group of people I\\u2019m supposed to meet up with soon enough. Instead I find this beautiful big grassy field and a rope swing. I\\u2019m excited to see this. I climb up the rope and I start to swing. I\\u2019m looking across the green grass and seeing all the festival stands. People are setting up and selling chai and delicious food and arts and crafts. I see a man I recognize from college. There was an attraction in college of him towards me, but nothing developed. I\\u2019m swinging and then I wave at him and I do this marvelous huge swing that ends in a backflip. I land on my two feet with such strength and grace. He looks and applauds. He\\u2019s laughing and walks along. I\\u2019m looking for my bag again because it has my money and tent supplies. I don\\u2019t find it, but I do end up going to a bathhouse where I find some of the people from my group. They are chiropractic colleagues in waking life. They're so happy to see me and say, \\u201cOh Viviane, you can stay! We have an extra space in the master bedroom we rented for the weekend.\\u201d But I think I\\u2019m going to have to pay for this and I don\\u2019t have the money. I am happy to see them. Then I\\u2019m wandering through the festival and I\\u2019d love a chai, but I don\\u2019t have the money. I end up walking out of the festival along a neighborhood path and I see big houses. All of the houses have been turned into communes. People are living together and that\\u2019s how they can afford to live in this area of town and they\\u2019ve turned this nice area into a community based on communal living homes.\"],[\"Left the house and forget my mask\"],[\"Life of Pi- Me seeing Pi in the ocean, I see things from his perspective.\"],[\"Like I can Identify the person in my dream but they can sometimes mix with a person I be having some crazy dreams still not sure if all this normal yet .

There is a big gathering at a retreat center. We\\u2019ve been here before in dreamtime. Before it was a lot more spacious with only two big beds in each of the rooms. Now there are five smaller beds in one room and women are getting settled in their beds. I go in with my son and we say hello. He climbs up on the different beds. I recognize one person as a patient of mine in waking life. We go into a room we\\u2019ve stayed in before. Instead of two beds, this room now has four. I look for mine. I see my friend Dee. People are talking about the pluses and minuses of this new situation. It\\u2019s less expensive at least. We go downstairs to a packing and shipping operation. We are being forced into this labor. It\\u2019s a Facebook meets Amazon thing. The man is showing us what we need to do. A crane is lifting a huge heavy box filled with rubber masks. It brings it to a truck to be shipped. Now we are all made to sit at our stations and are then given a box of cardboard envelopes. We are supposed to open the box and remove the ten envelopes. I open an envelope, stuff it with a rubber mask and a flyer with the image of an American flag, then lick the flap, seal it closed and put it in another box. We are all doing this. I\\u2019m nearly done with my box when I get to an envelope that is deformed. The flap is difficult to open - it\\u2019s wrinkled and torn. Once I put the mask in the envelope, I have a really hard time closing it and sealing it. I\\u2019m concerned that they\\u2019ll come by and look at my work and my work will be unacceptable. I have a sense of my grandmother\\u2019s presence for a bit, but then she moves on. They do come by and give me this look and make a note on their clipboard, so now I\\u2019m being watched more carefully. Then we are ushered over to a grassy hill, like an outdoor amphitheater. I see Dee again. I also see John Friend sitting on the grass with a couple young women on either side. The women have these sour judgmental looks on their faces. I find it curious that he\\u2019s here in the audience. This is a teaching conference and it seems he\\u2019s there to cause disruption and discontent and questioning of the new authority. Somehow because of his presence and the women on his sides, there is less order.

A thin woman in her sixties with short grey hair. She is a librarian. She was once a student but didn\\u2019t finish her studies because of the danger to her family. She stays close to the students and books, quietly watching out for them and absorbing all of the information in the Records. This is a university in the sky. A younger woman, a student, feels something, knows something. She is at the library searching for safety in knowledge. The older woman steps out from behind the bookshelves and her silent observation to assist. They are both now falling/flying through the clouds. Now, darkness on a river, water black because of night. The older woman is there but no longer directly involved. The younger woman is in the river with the men. So much activity. Men are being trained for dangerous physical labor. She is in with them. Huge pumpkins and watermelons are being poured into the water. They have to sort them quickly so they need to be as close as possible, but that means they are in danger of their heads being smashed and their bodies drowned. Once sorted, the pumpkins and melons float down the river. She is floating alongside a man now. The man has also just arrived and is being trained. They have separated from the rest. They look down and see far below them a family of orcas. They are trying to be as still as possible as they stay afloat. They don\\u2019t want the orcas to notice them, but they also know they\\u2019ve been seen. More orcas arrive. There are so many and the water is so deep! To their right, the rest of the people are now skimming by on extremely fast pointed black boards. Those people know the dangers of the water and have been properly trained and prepared.

Then we realize that it\\u2019s a really dangerous thing we\\u2019ve done - waking him up. He\\u2019s now after us with a gun. I run downstairs and move a bench out of the way next to a bed and shimmy under the bed. I\\u2019m hiding there and I can see under the bed that it\\u2019s dusty with moth balls.

It\\u2019s really early morning and dark - the sun has started to rise.\"],[\"My dream was like a full on sci-fi movie starring Ryan Renolds. It starts out with us in outer space and there are aliens who are trying to bomb the earth or blow up the entire universe. The drama is high. Everyone is in panic and fight or flight mode. I think I\\u2019m on a ship. We\\u2019re trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. Ryan Renolds is trying to come up with a plan. There are a ton of people and I don\\u2019t know any of them. They are the movie extras. I don\\u2019t think I see the aliens, I just see their ships through a spaceship window. The plan includes getting ahold of these two units that will blow something up - very typical movie bullshit. I\\u2019m on the ship. There are a couple ships in the fleet. All of the ships fly at superspeed. They\\u2019re flying through the planets in our solar system, so we\\u2019re whizzing by Mars and Venus, then you see Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. I think the goal is to get to Jupiter or Saturn and blow up one of them. So, this is the scene. Then just like in the movies, the movie cuts away to Earth because we\\u2019re all trying to save Earth. The sky on Earth is a blood red - it looks like how the sky looked when all the smoke was around. I\\u2019m on the street suddenly and Ryan Renolds is with me. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m actually interacting with him or not. It\\u2019s almost like I\\u2019m silently following him at first. I guess I\\u2019m the girlfriend character in the movie and he\\u2019s talking with me. We\\u2019re on the streets of Earth and I look up and see the sky is red. I keep seeing all these white parachutes falling - it\\u2019s the people who were on the spaceships. They\\u2019re coming home so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. They\\u2019re all ejecting out of space and coming down to Earth for one last goodbye to all the people they love. In the meantime, Ryan is still trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. They\\u2019re trying to find the hole in their plans or where their weak spot is. There\\u2019s a scene with the parachutes falling and I\\u2019m listening to him talk and figure something out. Then the scene cuts away to what looks like Mission Control. There\\u2019s a woman reading a screen monitor. At one point, I remember seeing Ryan type into this computer: \\u201cHappy Birthday!\\u201d When he does that, all the aliens who were of one hive mind, suddenly say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my birthday, it\\u2019s my birthday! Happy birthday to me! No, it\\u2019s my birthday!\\u201d And this is just filling up the screen with all the aliens all talking to each other. Also, this woman at Mission Control whose computer this is realizes that all of the aliens look like humans and have been on Earth this whole time and now all of a sudden they\\u2019re fragmenting out into individuals because Ryan typed this one thing into the computer. She\\u2019s sitting back and laughing because she\\u2019s unlocked the key of whatever it is we need to know about them. Then, the scene goes back to me and Ryan. Now a lot of time has passed since he typed \\u201cHappy Birthday\\u201d into the computer. He and I are running through the streets of a city. The people speak English. Somebody is trying to catch him. I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s these aliens disguised as humans or humans helping aliens or humans who are idiots. But there\\u2019s a cop looking person. The uniform is slightly different than a cop uniform. It\\u2019s almost like they have different rights as a cop - more rights. They are trying to catch Ryan. I\\u2019m a little further away from him now. I\\u2019m not sure why. The cop starts to beat him up with a billy club. There\\u2019s a bunch of other people with the cop who are also trying to beat him up. I\\u2019m pissed off. He\\u2019s fighting back. I run over there. They dropped him. He\\u2019s immobilized. They start to wrap him in a plastic sheet with a couple layers and then a blanket. I get to them and start swinging enough to clear the space. They back up away from me. I unwrap Ryan and his left shoulder is totally dislocated and looks terrible. I pop it back in for him. Then I pull him. We start to head off. I\\u2019m threatening these people the whole time like, \\u201cFuck off. I will fuck you up.\\u201d The funny thing is when I was throwing the punches, it was very very unskilled and I couldn\\u2019t have hurt anybody, yet they backed away. So it\\u2019s kind of like they were just letting me do it. The lucid part of my mind is like, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t fight for shit! You need to learn how to fight!\\u201d I go back into the dream and Ryan and I start running. The cop is yelling some bullshit at us as we go and I\\u2019m ignoring it, but part of me is wondering why they are letting us go because I wasn\\u2019t such a good fighter. And why did they just rough Ryan up and then let us run off? It doesn\\u2019t make any sense. Then Ryan realizes there\\u2019s one other thing he needs to do to help things.

Then I\\u2019m in a big hotel. My husband has engaged the services of a male escort. He\\u2019s really looking forward to this man because he\\u2019s a very good kisser. But the man\\u2019s body is so distorted - he\\u2019s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I\\u2019m not happy about the situation but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He\\u2019s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we\\u2019re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I\\u2019m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it\\u2019s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can\\u2019t recall much more. Then we\\u2019re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter. I\\u2019m really upset that he\\u2019s breathing on me and that these people walked into our dining room obviously sick and just off a plane or boat. The scene shifts. I\\u2019m outside walking along a marina. There is shallow water with rocks like tidepools. I look down into the water and see two black and white cats curled together in a circle. They are all wet. I think it\\u2019s odd that the cats are so pleasantly sleeping floating on the water. I keep walking and see a couple drenched yellow chicks. I wonder if they\\u2019ve drowned or if they\\u2019re also sleeping. Then I see a turkey struggling on its back in the water between rocks. I see pigs doing the same along with some other animals. It\\u2019s a very odd scene.\"],[\"My little brown wallet has gone missing, maybe I have lost it?....Then, lots of people at the party are doing things with their phones\\u2026.Augmented reality?....a well-dressed black man and woman, a couple, are looking at abstract shapes and outlines in the air\\u2026.I can see some of the white lines, making various geometric shapes\\u2026.it is a cool and impressive technology, but is it real?....it feels somehow moving in the wrong direction\\u2026.\"],[\"My mom getting coronavirus\"],[\"My mom is standing with her shins next to a child\\u2019s trampoline. In the middle of the trampoline is a pile of things that she is not aware of. She is looking around the room. I look down and see two snakes. At first I assume they are just plastic. They are both black, yellow and red. One is primarily yellow, the other is primarily red. Then I look more carefully and see they are alive. I stop for a moment and think this is impossible. But they are both stretching out towards my mom and one has its tongue out as if tasting the air around her leg. Then I realize they are alive and I urge my mom to stand back because these snakes are alive. She quickly moves back. Then, we realize it\\u2019s a test of some kind. One snake is poisonous and the other is not. Which one is poisonous? We are trying to remember by their markings. In another scene, I\\u2019m with Pema upstairs in my home (it shares some similarities with my current apartment, but not entirely). The banisters are overgrown with lavender, but it's growing as a vine. We are talking about family dynamics, particularly our parents\\u2019 dynamics. She tells me that her mom told her that her dad would never leave because it\\u2019s too complicated. Somehow, her saying this reassures me. Then someone comes and ties back the lavender with bungee cords to tame it and help guide its growth, so it doesn\\u2019t overcrowd the hallway. It looks more beautiful now. I\\u2019m upstairs for a while, then I notice new decorations on the wall - carved wood. I go downstairs and see it was some kind of Christmas day. My dad and my sister are sitting on the couch, and there\\u2019s a man with bright red hair sitting on the floor. They\\u2019re watching a movie on the projector screen. They have just opened presents. The guy asks my sister about the origin story of her daughter\\u2019s name. She starts to cry because it is such a poignant story. She says, \\u201cI wonder if I can just write it on paper? Then I wouldn\\u2019t cry so much.\\u201d The guy steps away to give her space. She starts to cry those soft tears of memory. We are all waiting for her to tell the story of her daughter\\u2019s name. In another scene I see two swans stepping into the water.

I go over to get in with him and see there is shit everywhere in the water. It\\u2019s not his. It was just floating in the tub. There are other people in the hot tub - random people from a dance company. They are talking about their dance company. They ask me why I haven\\u2019t left the company that I\\u2019ve joined yet. They ask, \\u201cHasn\\u2019t it been enough? Why do you still stay?\\u201d I step in to try and get my son out. He submerses himself under the water. Now it\\u2019s worse because I\\u2019m afraid he could be ingesting this poop water. There\\u2019s a moment of panic when I try to get him from under the water. He\\u2019s younger than he is now - probably 9 months or so. I scoop him up out of the water. The poop has not only been stirred up in the water, but is now stuck to my legs, arms and hands. I\\u2019m trying to keep hold of my son while washing the shit off. It\\u2019s turned into a facial mask consistency - slimy and fully stuck on me. I\\u2019m absolutely disgusted. I get out and I still have this on me. We have to get dressed. Now we\\u2019re walking down a street through a neighborhood to downtown. There are a lot of other people walking on the street, too - actually walking in the middle of the street because it has been closed to vehicle traffic. There are quite a few homeless people with shopping carts and random plastic bags of things loitering around and quite dirty. We have to stop at a stoplight. Then we keep on going. We end up at a food stand and order food to go. I\\u2019m with my husband and my son now. They give us our food in a to-go bag. The plastic bag has a knot in the top to hold it closed and trying not to touch more of it because I don\\u2019t know how clean the bag is and I don't want to contaminate the food. I don\\u2019t want to be contaminated and I don\\u2019t want to contaminate the food, myself. We keep on walking and end up at a food truck place with multiple vendors. At one stand, they are doing a cooking demonstration. They are making an amazing wrap with long filets of salmon and cucumber and a wonderful lemongrass sauce. They are demonstrating the creation of this food. My son and I are watching as my husband goes to wash his hands. I\\u2019m holding the other food and regretting that we bought it before we knew about this food. The salmon dish looks delicious. I notice my husband has been gone for a long time. I go looking for him. I can\\u2019t find him anywhere. Finally I see a round table with all our stuff on it - our wet clothes laid out on the table and over the chairs. Our bag is on the chair, too. I\\u2019m relieved to see that the clothes are out to dry.

I was driving a red convertible to the ocean again, I was with my ex Rory and his friends. We found a place to sit down on a patch of rocks on the water\\u2019s edge and there was a young black man right next to us and I couldn\\u2019t take my eyes off him, I knew him, the one from my other dreams.

I feel like I know you.\\u201d He introduced himself quietly and smiled so I saw all his teeth but I don\\u2019t remember his name. His voice was so kind. He took off his baseball cap and put it on my head over my straw hat, and nestled it in to make sure it was on there. He said something about there\\u2019s only eight groups of us at this beach. Then he got in the water. Then Rory and I decided we were hungry, debating between tacos and lobster rolls so we started walking on this decrepit but very crowded boardwalk. We saw lots of artists, lots of homeless people. One woman was sitting in a wheelchair; her face was painted grayish white but her lips were moving and I asked if she was okay but she didn\\u2019t answer and everyone kept walking by. She was dying slowly right there invisible but how could you miss her. It was like her body was 95 perfectly entombed. Then the waves started to come at first splashed through the boardwalk and then bigger where we had to hold onto the railings. Then we turned to leave and the waves kept coming and washing out the boardwalk in every direction, the railing was not sturdy; there were areas it was replaced with children safety gates and didn\\u2019t feel sustainable and I held on by the tips of my fingers and felt the water lift the rest of my body up and thought I couldn\\u2019t hold on any longer. People were just holding on wave after wave and we were losing each other but I wasn\\u2019t panicked because I let my body just float when it needed to float and move when it could. The people with their feet on the ground kept getting knocked over. I shouted to let go, let go and hold on hands only but they didn\\u2019t listen. After what felt like forever, it stopped. I walked along the inside of the artist areas and people were in there with water on the floor but otherwise unaffected. A group of white young women wearing all white shirts and green shorts came in perfectly dry and complaining loudly that they weren\\u2019t letting people in because of the waves and I really gave it to them. I let them know about the severity of the ordeal and they needed to be careful too if they were going down there. They didn\\u2019t seem to care that people just died. They just shrugged their shoulders. Then my father in law was at the boardwalk and we were checking out all of the art and he turned to me and said \\u201clet\\u2019s get a tattoo!\\u201d In real life this is something he has been telling me about as a memory of his son, my late husband.\"],[\"nightmares- paying for 5 years in future- 25k\"],[\"no\"],[\"None\"],[\"Not a movie, but I'd seen a program about cars of the past....and saw one of the first cars I'd ever owned.

There are also two green magnets. She\\u2019s telling me how to read the collage for the ceremony. She moves the magnets around, so one magnet is at the beginning of the reading and the other shows where to stop reading. As we are looking, it sort of makes sense. I hold out the paper and begin, but as I\\u2019m reading, the collage changes size, the magnets move, the words turn into Spanish and others turn into Sunday morning type cartoons.

I don\\u2019t know if their professors or the actual astronauts find us in their office. We snuck in. there\\u2019s a sense that we shouldn\\u2019t be there. They come in. It's two or three of the astronauts who are also teachers. They sit down and I can tell they know what we\\u2019re trying to do and there\\u2019s no way in hell it\\u2019s going to happen. But they indulge us. They are asking the kids all these questions: \\u201cHow are you going to do this, this and this? How are you going to take care of this? What food are you going to eat? The food question is funny because we\\u2019re all actually eating food and some of the kids are wanting to share the food with the astronauts. I can tell that the other kids are not aware that these teachers are the actual astronauts. They haven\\u2019t put that together yet. I\\u2019m watching all of this and also in the conversation and offering some of my food to one of the astronauts even though I know they\\u2019re going to say no. the reason they\\u2019re asking all these questions is that at some point they\\u2019re going to say we can\\u2019t do all this stuff because we\\u2019re not prepared. We are sitting around a rounded desk. This goes on for a while. The scene changes. We never get on a spaceship or anything. The teachers/astronauts never say, \\u201cNo you\\u2019re not going,\\u201d or \\u201cYou\\u2019re in trouble for breaking into the office.\\u201d I keep waiting for that to happen and it doesn\\u2019t happen. It\\u2019s like the astronauts are so bemused by the excitement and enthusiasm of the kids that they let it play out. Then I am hanging with Johnny and Amanda again - I\\u2019ve known both of them since second grade. They were married seven or eight years ago and now have a couple kids. Johnny is the leader again. He has a group of people with him. I don\\u2019t recognize all the people, but I do see Amanda there. He\\u2019s pretty upbeat and everybody is excited to be there. We are outside in my backyard somehow. At one point, I\\u2019m watching him and he\\u2019s moving around the crowd. He comes to me and picks me up. We\\u2019re holding hands and our arms are locked. I\\u2019m using all of my muscles to stay upright. He\\u2019s moving me around like in acroyoga. I am thinking how this takes a lot of shoulder strength to hold me up like this. It takes a lot of shoulder strength on my end to hold myself up like this, too! Everybody is having a good time. Then suddenly it\\u2019s time to go. It\\u2019s time to move on. It\\u2019s time for Johnny to move his group of people and I\\u2019m with them. Now I have a pair of roller skates on. There are a couple other other moms in this group as well, and they also have roller skates on. There are younger kids with roller skates on. There are moms wearing their kids. I think Amanda is wearing a baby. I watch them go. I think I should also grab my tennis shoes in case we have to go uphill or we have to go inside where roller skates are not a good idea. So I\\u2019m watching them go and decide to go with them first because I want to see where they go. I forget to get my shoes. I can feel how fast I\\u2019m gliding in these roller skates and it\\u2019s a lot of fun. There are other moms in this group. I\\u2019m at the back of the crowd. We are skating down streets but the streets are cracked and there\\u2019s grass growing up out of the streets. So it\\u2019s not super smooth. I realize I really do need to get my shoes. The group is going really slow so I do have time to skate back to my place and grab my shoes. Wherever we\\u2019re going, we are leaving these places for good. We aren\\u2019t coming back. I leave the group and it kind of feels a little bit painful but I know I\\u2019ll be able to find them because I\\u2019m on roller skates and I\\u2019m going faster than they are. I know I\\u2019ll be able to hear them. So I roller skate back to my house up this hill. I\\u2019m going really fast. I grab my tennis shoes and put them in this backpack. Instead of going the way I came with the group, I cut across all of these streets. The streets remind me of the streets around the college I went to - residential area for college students and professors. There are tall trees. The cracks in the sidewalk are still there. Things look kind of old and there is ivy growing on things. There are lots of flowers on the lawns. Then I get to an apartment complex with multiple levels. All of these levels are connected by stairs. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYeah, stairs and roller skates, not going to happen.\\u201d So I put my tennis shoes on. I can hear the group. Johnny is shepherding them at this point. My friend Ikaika who I have also known since second grade and grew up with is now in the group, too. They\\u2019re trying to go up one of the sets of stairs on the outside of the apartment building. There is a younger woman - well, she\\u2019s the same age as everyone in the group, we\\u2019re all younger than we are in real life, maybe in our twenties or early thirties. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, you cannot take this entire group through this apartment complex and go up these stairs.\\u201d It\\u2019s interesting because the streets I\\u2019m on are two or three levels above where the group is trying to climb the stairs to get up to these streets. So they\\u2019re definitely at a lower level of the road or something. Johnny is trying to bring them up the stairs and Ikaika is trying as well. Those two are super frustrated. I go and talk to the young woman. But I have to go through somebody\\u2019s apartment. It\\u2019s a college apartment so there are four people crammed into this tiny apartment and this is why the woman is saying, \\u201cNo, stop trying to bring this group of people up through this. It\\u2019s small and there\\u2019s not enough room for them! And you\\u2019re disturbing all of us who live here. You\\u2019re not taking into account the fact that we live here. You are singing loudly. You have kids. You have roller skates on.\\u201d I\\u2019m listening to her and she is pissed off. She\\u2019s not having it. She has blond hair down to her shoulders. Her skin is tan. She looks a bit ratty, not well kept. I go to talk to Johnny and Ikaika and say, \\u201cYou guys, we can go around. We don\\u2019t need to go through these peoples\\u2019 homes to get up to this next level.\\u201d They are so frustrated. They can\\u2019t see any other way than to come up the stairs. I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cNo, lets\\u2019 go around. There\\u2019s a road over here you can go up.\\u201d The dream ends here at an impasse with all these people trying to come up and this one girl trying to keep them out. I\\u2019m trying to convince them to go up around this road. No one arrives at a solution.\"],[\"The last dream I saw my old friend Luke in the parking lot and he asked where I\\u2019ve been and invited me to a party on a train. I got to the party and it was like boxcar apartments on the train and everyone was playing guitar. There was some kind of game or guitar competition, but it was really crowded and while it looked fun, I just wanted to get off the moving train and away from all of these people, mostly men. Something about it didn\\u2019t feel safe.\"],[\"The last dream: I was with someone who represented a former boyfriend and we were late to get to a circus in Monterey.

It feels like a hotel in that there is a large foyer with a front desk and a person who assigns rooms and provides plastic card keys. It feels like an apartment in that people are more permanently ehre and the rooms have a kitchen, sitting room and are decorated according to people\\u2019s unique tastes. At first I am in my own room. Then I go to a gathering in another room. I\\u2019m meeting with a group of people - some who were in my Gaelic language class - and others also from the town where I live. There\\u2019s consternation about the growth of the town. When the meeting is over, people go their separate ways. I\\u2019m supposed to teach a private yoga lesson. My client has purchased this for her fiance. I\\u2019m trying to find him. There\\u2019s an older lady from the meeting who delays me. She carries magic, crone wisdom, and seeing skills. She wants to ask me questions and get a read of me. I want to have this connection with her, yet at the same time I need to keep my appointment - a zoom call. It\\u2019s getting really close to the start time of the class. She brings me into the kitchen and asks me questions. I\\u2019m uncomfortable with the conversation and hoping I\\u2019m giving satisfactory answers. I feel out of place. I am now late for my appointment. I\\u2019m trying to be present with her and maintain my obligations and somehow let him know I\\u2019m running late because I know he\\u2019s waiting. Finally, it\\u2019s fifteen minutes past the hour and she nods to release me. I\\u2019m trying to get to my room so I can start the lesson. When I get to my room, there are other movement instructors in my room and signing in their classes on my computer. They\\u2019ve created excel spreadsheets and downloaded new programs on my computer desktop. I\\u2019m trying to close those down but not disturb their process. I\\u2019m also annoyed they\\u2019ve taken over my computer for their own purposes. I\\u2019m also uneasy that so many people are passing through my rooms to get to the studio. After all this messing around, I finally sign in. He\\u2019s not there. I see that he has checked in eight different times but has given up. I\\u2019m disappointed at letting him down. Time passes. I\\u2019m looking at a map of a river and structures being built along the river. Somehow I see people on bicycles riding up and down. I also see fires being started as well. I don\\u2019t know if the fires are started by people or nature. We are sending out crews of people to discover what\\u2019s happening and put out the fires.\"],[\"THe shipped in rioters and those that burned and looted buildings regardless of what race owned it.

Maybe the youngest is 5 or 6 and it goes up to teenagers. They are ice skaters and they\\u2019re all practicing to put on a show. I\\u2019m watching the instructors teach them. There is something missing in the instruction. The dances are sloppy - their lines aren't straight, they\\u2019re not finishing their movements, and it just doesn\\u2019t look good. The teachers are hard and harsh with their instruction. You can see on the faces of the kids that they don\\u2019t like it. So I\\u2019m hired as a strength and conditioning coach. I end up taking a different role where I invite the kids to a stage - sort of like an opera house. It\\u2019s all wood and they\\u2019re ice skating on the wood. I don\\u2019t know how this is possible. However, I invite them, \\u201cHey, come work out with me. We\\u2019re going to make you guys stronger. Why don\\u2019t you guys show me your dances so I can see.\\u201d As I\\u2019m watching, I realize they aren\\u2019t in it. They don\\u2019t have 100% commitment to the dance they\\u2019re putting on, to the movements they\\u2019re making. They are just sort of half-assing everything. So I\\u2019m giving them a pep talk: \\u201cYou guys have to commit to making this dance happen. You have to commit to be in the spot you\\u2019re in so the line is straight. Or you have to extend your leg and your arm. You have to really go for that jump. Give it as much as you\\u2019ve got.\\u201d While I\\u2019m giving this talk, they\\u2019re nodding at me and smiling. You can feel the energy shift. Now they\\u2019re motivated to do it. They go back out to dance and they\\u2019re doing much better. I have this feeling that the other instructors are pissed off at me for doing that, like I had stepped out of my role and my position and overstepped their boundaries. Part of me is like, \\u201cYou should have told them that.\\u201d The other part of me is like, \\u201cOh gosh, now I might not have a job.\\u201d So I\\u2019m in a very interesting place, kind of like fuck you and fuck it. It\\u2019s more important to me to see these kids light up and shine because they\\u2019re very, very talented skaters. I want them to show people what they know how to do. Then it shifts. I\\u2019m with a friend of mine. She and I are hungry. We\\u2019re going to go eat at a restaurant. We\\u2019re walking down a boardwalk by the sea. The sea is to our right. We\\u2019re walking towards a shack at the end of this boardwalk that is a restaurant. There are tall pilings. It\\u2019s above sea water but right there at the edge of the ocean. There are seagulls and I can feel the salt spray because it is a bit windy. We are bundled up. We walk out to this sea shack of a restaurant. We sit down and start to order. I have this fizzy drink that looks like an energy drink can. I have it in my hand. She is teasing me about something I said earlier and she\\u2019s using a funny voice. It\\u2019s cracking me up but I\\u2019m also feeling kind of embarrassed. But it\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s funny. So we\\u2019re at our table and order. I spill the energy drink. She and I are sitting down. I have four books in my lap. The two of us are looking at these books. One is an embroidery book. It\\u2019s important because there\\u2019s a group of women at a table across from us. My friend and I are going through these books, downloading information from these four books. The books are still in my lap and the women look at the two books on top of the pile side by side. They say, \\u201cOh, those are good books.\\u201d When I remove the top two and they look at the two underneath, one of which is the embroidery book, the women get super judgmental and say, \\u201cWell, those books are crap!\\u201d My friend and I are thinking but don\\u2019t actually say out loud: \\u201cOh, okay, well no one asked you. We weren\\u2019t even talking to you, but thank you for interjecting yourself into our conversation.\\u201d We say something pleasant, \\u201cUh huh, thanks for your feedback.\\u201d Then at this point, I\\u2019ve already spilled the energy drink once and it gets cleaned up. But then I spill it again. I make a much bigger mess this time. It\\u2019s an energy drink and is all sticky and it smells like strawberry. I\\u2019m not actually drinking it, just apparently holding it and spilling it on the floor. Now I\\u2019m embarrassed. I get up to find a mop. I ask the cook and one of the servers. The cook is my brother and the manager is my other brother. They point me to the cleaning closet. I get the mop and go to mop it up, but it\\u2019s already been moped up. I look up and am like, \\u201cWho cleaned this up?\\u201d It was the server that I\\u2019d passed. He said, \\u201cI already cleaned it up once already, so I just cleaned it up a second time.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m feeling bad because I\\u2019ve made a mess twice and someone else has cleaned it up twice and it is a sticky mess. I think I\\u2019m hungry and we haven\\u2019t gotten our food. But I\\u2019m ready to just go.\"],[\"There are a bunch of kids that I\\u2019m in charge of somehow. I\\u2019m a caretaker, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure how - I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m their mother or not. I\\u2019m needing to get them to a safer place. I have a little bit of help. There are hallways where I\\u2019m trying to gather them up from and get them on a bus so they can be in a safer spot. I\\u2019m really clear that I don\\u2019t want that responsibility. I\\u2019m going to make sure they get where they need to go, but after that the choices I make are going to have a lot less to do with being their caretaker 24/7. These are not my kids. These are just random children. I can't tell if it\\u2019s a school or daycare or something. It\\u2019s everybody\\u2019s children, but they are not of my body. So, there are other people around who are also caretaking them and trying to get them to wherever they need to go. There\\u2019s just this feeling of needing to get them to a safe place. We get them somewhere, but I drift out of the scene somehow. I end up trying to find a home for myself. My beloved is with me now. We\\u2019re looking at houses - they are the same houses we were looking for for the kids. We were looking at a dormitory or something for them to live in. i\\u2019m looking for a house for myself. I\\u2019m clear that I only want enough house for me and one other person to come stay with me whenever they want. They find a cute house. I can only see the inside of it. It\\u2019s in a neighborhood kind of like the one I grew up in, but I can't really see the outside of it. There are cute cupboards. There isn\\u2019t a lot of space because it\\u2019s just me. There is a lot of wood paneling on the inside. I\\u2019m trying to decide if I\\u2019m going to be there. Then we go out of the house and all of a sudden there\\u2019s water everywhere - ocean. I\\u2019m collecting shells and I can see down to the bottom of the ocean. It\\u2019s really clear. I\\u2019m trying to collect the shells and I drop one and watch it sink down to the bottom. I\\u2019m trying to gauge the depth of the water based on how small the item looks, but water magnifies it so i can\\u2019t tell the true depth of the water. So I\\u2019m looking at this one shell that I dropped which then turns into a shoe. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not my shoe. I don\\u2019t want the shoe, I want my shell. The shells are prettier.\\u201d My beloved is there and he\\u2019s helping me collect these shells and I have a few. Then the scene morphs. That one shoe takes me to another scene. I\\u2019m carrying bags of trash. It\\u2019s actually not trash - it\\u2019s stuff I\\u2019m getting rid of, all these clothes and things I used to have or need but now I don\\u2019t. It includes pairs of shoes. The trash bags go in the trashcan and the pairs of shoes go on top of the trashcan. I\\u2019m back in a neighborhood again and I\\u2019m taking the trash over to my neighbor\\u2019s house so she can look at it. I take out one bag of trash and only one shoe, one of my snow boots. I go get another bag of stuff and the other boot goes on top of the can. Then I get a third bag and there\\u2019s one more shoe - I don\\u2019t remember what kind of shoe. I see these three shoes and then all of a sudden I\\u2019m done with this and want to dance. I want to dance like the way break dancers dance with all body weight and where you go upside down a lot. But I\\u2019m not very good at it. This area where I was taking the trash bags to changes into an amphitheatre with no walls. There are lights being projected. I\\u2019m moving my body and it\\u2019s really awkward in the beginning. My body hurts, I don\\u2019t have the strength for some of the moves, I can\\u2019t think of some of the moves I want to do, I don\\u2019t have much flow and my body is really jerky. At some point I see myself in a mirror - these mirrors have shown up as part of the walls even though it\\u2019s a completely outdoor space. I have short deep auburn red hair. At one point, scratches appear on my back. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh no no, we\\u2019re not going that direction!\\u201d I somehow wipe the scratches off my back as an observer, then I go back into my body and try to dance. I think there\\u2019s part of me that is still in the observer role because I\\u2019m watching myself dance in the mirror. Suddenly the mirrors turn a brilliant turquoise blue. They become the background. There\\u2019s also granite rock mountains in the back. I feel something click in my body and brain and I let go. I\\u2019m suddenly dancing fluidly and my body becomes a lot more muscular. I suddenly have the musculature to be upside down and doing handstands with splits and backflips and a lot of break dance moves where you spin on your shoulders and flip in the air. My legs are really strong. Everything is really really strong. This background of turquoise teal blue is bright like an electric vibrant brightness and the granite rock is reflected in the mirror somehow with me also reflected in the mirror doing dances to some music I can hear.\"],[\"There are a number of women - I actually don\\u2019t know any of them. They seem younger than me, although we're all in our early or late twenties, but my perspective feels older as if I\\u2019ve had more life experience than your average 20 year old. We are in a school of some sort, like a college, but it\\u2019s a compound - there\\u2019s buildings everywhere. We are all at a fashion show. We have gone into this really big room. It has floor to ceiling windows. We\\u2019re trying on all the different items we are going to be wearing to walk the catwalk. It\\u2019s a lingerie fashion show. The thing is, some of the other girls who are younger than me, their choices of lingerie are not particularly revealing, which I don\\u2019t have any thoughts around. But my choices are. I\\u2019m wearing a black lace super cheeky booty short bottoms and the top is see-through lace and midriff. One of the girls is like, \\u201cAre you going to wear that?\\u201d I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s a fashion show. Yes. It\\u2019s like Victoria\\u2019s Secret. We just walk down the catwalk showing off the clothes.\\u201d There\\u2019s a little bit of shame in her voice and I contract for a second and put a corset on over. It\\u2019s interesting this corset has sleeves. Then I look down and see that I\\u2019ve put the sleeved corset on underneath the black lacy thing, so you can see the black lacy thing on top. The corset is on below. I\\u2019ve also put on a skirt to cover up the black bottoms, but the bottoms are black and the skirt is an almost see-through light pink, so you can still see the bottoms. So I put that on and am like, \\u201cOkay, this is better. I guess.\\u201d I\\u2019m standing there watching some of the other girls walk down the catwalk, and then think, \\u201cNo, this isn\\u2019t better. This isn\\u2019t what I want to wear. This isn\\u2019t me.\\u201d So I take off the bottoms and I take off the corset - I just sort of rip it off, although the sleeves stay on, which is weird because I have to take the sleeves off separately. Then I\\u2019m back in what I was wearing previously with just the black lace and it feels way better. We are inside right now, but we are all still milling about because it\\u2019s not time for the show yet. Then we get the word that we\\u2019re actually going to show the last piece of clothing that we\\u2019re all wearing outside. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo way! It is freezing. It is below freezing. It is so cold outside. We can\\u2019t go out there in our lingerie.\\u201d So I find a coat and put some of the other layers - the corset goes back on. I go to the outside area where we are all supposed to be showing what we\\u2019re wearing. I realize I don\\u2019t have any boots on and my feet are going to freeze. So me and another friend stop and we swing by our dormitory room. I go in and grab some of my fur-lined boots. As I\\u2019m heading out to walk out to this place, some of the girls comment and say, \\u201cNever mind, they cancelled that. It\\u2019s too cold.\\u201d I am relieved. They say, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s time for us to go to the cafeteria,\\u201d or someplace - it\\u2019s a big gathering area where there\\u2019s a ton of us. Now I\\u2019m wearing a very interesting hodgepodge of clothes, but it doesn\\u2019t matter because it\\u2019s time to eat and I\\u2019m hungry. So I follow them to this dining area. Up until this point there were only women in the dream, but now there\\u2019s men, too. There\\u2019s men and women all gathering in this communal area where there\\u2019s food available. I\\u2019m going through the line, trying to decide what to eat and I\\u2019m starving. I\\u2019ve ordered a lot of food. I have my tray and I\\u2019m putting it on my tray. There\\u2019s a friend of mine who\\u2019s with me - it\\u2019s a guy and I don\\u2019t recognize him, but he is somebody I know, somebody I am familiar with. I\\u2019m eating, but handing him food because he\\u2019s hungry, too. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHere, eat some of this.\\u201d He\\u2019s making the comment that I\\u2019m eating so much. I guess that\\u2019s because I'm still wearing these clothes for modeling the lingerie and he\\u2019s commenting on how much I\\u2019m eating. I\\u2019m a little annoyed about that because what the fuck, how much I eat doesn\\u2019t have anything to do with my ability to model lingerie. There\\u2019s not a specific look, either. I\\u2019m just annoyed by the seemingly still narrow definition of beauty. So I actually just walk off after that. I take my food and leave. There\\u2019s a bunch of girls I\\u2019ve been modeling with - they show up and they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOkay, now we have to go here and now we have to go here.\\u201d So I\\u2019m kind of trying to follow along. They\\u2019re collecting something for a party and I\\u2019m not sure exactly what it is. They\\u2019re trying to get all of these things in order for the party. This is the part of the dream where it\\u2019s been building, this feeling of being a little on the outside because I'm just not quite in the flow of what they\\u2019re all doing. The stuff they\\u2019re interested in just doesn't quite interest me and the way they do it, I don\\u2019t quite do it that way. This is the point in the dream where it really shows up and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNo, no, I\\u2019m actually not even interested in what any of you are doing right now, your party or whatever it is. I think I\\u2019m just going to do my own thing. That\\u2019s where I leave and the dream ends.\"],[\"There are four separate interrelated scenes - a really nice apartment condo by the ocean; a little Cobb style house that once belonged to Jeremy; a lovely home and office built around a tree at a retreat center; and a hospital in Hawaii. I am moving into a really nice condo. It\\u2019s modern with new appliances, white walls, high ceilings, big floor to ceiling windows with a view of the ocean from every room. The ocean is choppy and dark, but beautiful. I\\u2019ve never been to New England but it seems like the Atlantic ocean of the northeastern United States. The rent is extremely affordable and I\\u2019m wondering why. I\\u2019m living with a childhood friend (we really only knew each other when I was an infant and he was five) and another woman who comes and goes. We are learning how to live with each other, learning each other\\u2019s rhythms with cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and working. The refrigerator is full of delicious food - produce and prepared meals. I go to see where he is. He\\u2019s napping on a couch with a book across his chest. He has his head towards me then he senses that I\\u2019m there on the couch and he turns his body so his feet are towards me. His knees are open and I feel a warmth and desire awaken in my body. I crawl up towards him and it surprises us both even though there has been an attraction between our souls since the beginning of my life. We go into the kitchen and there is a tentative quality to our interaction now, feeling each other out and this new expression of our relationship. I wrap my legs around him and kiss him. Then for a moment he switches to my dad then switches back. That was weird. But there is a beautiful connection and fluidity in the way we are together. It\\u2019s as if we were made to be together, but waking life circumstances didn\\u2019t work in our favor. Then I learn that the reason this condo is so affordable is because there are cameras everywhere set to film us making love. It\\u2019s like a pornography studio. I don\\u2019t really know what to make of it. But I love being here at the ocean and with him, so it\\u2019s okay. Then, the dream shifts. I am walking by a little Cobb style cottage that was for sale, but now it looks like someone has recently bought it and moved in. I think this house once belonged to Jeremy and Zoe. It\\u2019s really crafty. There are waves carved over the mantel and the front door. It\\u2019s tan and brown, really of the earth. There\\u2019s a wooden fence all around and a little garden. Inside, a fire is burning in the fireplace. Herbs are hanging from the ceiling. The furniture is warm and carved of wood. Everything is just enough and just right. No one is home. I go in through the door in the back and am walking around, curious to see if it feels like home to me. In a way, it does. I make a cup of tea and sit in front of the fire. Then I get a sense that whoever lives here will be returning home soon, so I need to make it look like I wasn\\u2019t there, moving things back and covering up my presence. I leave and walk around the corner past the front. This is when I see this symbolic spiral wave over the front door and I can see through the door and walls to how the design over the mantel is a continuation of this design. I walk away into another scene. I\\u2019m with my mom, dad and sister. We are touring a gorgeous place with a real estate agent. It\\u2019s a home modeled around a huge tree. It\\u2019s built in the round, like a spiral. There\\u2019s a lovely glass sunroom that wraps nearly all around and a deck around that. When you walk in, there\\u2019s the tree trunk, a fireplace and a sitting area with long curving couches designed for this space. A doorway leads to a spacious bedroom which I don\\u2019t go into yet. The home spirals to the right to a beautiful kitchen with an island. It\\u2019s a community kitchen with a pantry stocked full. It continues into a laundry room and a room for the cats. As we are in the kitchen, another group comes in and goes upstairs. The real estate is angry because we now know how public this home is - anyone who lives at the retreat center has full access to this kitchen and to the offices upstairs. There is a recording studio and office with computers and printer upstairs. It is quite loud and we realize it won\\u2019t be a private home. We are still interested though. She shows us through the laundry room to the glass sunroom and cat walk that spirals around the front. It\\u2019s warm and bright and there is a cat lounging in the sun. I love it. She takes us upstairs to this beautiful office. Everything is furnished and lovely. We go back downstairs and into the spacious bedroom. I realize this is an apartment in and of itself. It\\u2019s big and open. There\\u2019s a fireplace where you can roast potatoes in the ashes. There are old fashioned iron stovetops with terracotta pots set on top to radiate warmth into the space. They are cooking a feast of roasted chickens and breads and other kinds of meat and vegetables. It smells so good. I tell my dad, \\u201cHow wonderful would it be to learn how to use these stoves and cook these gorgeous meals?!\\u201d I go down one step to look at the bedroom to see if it will be good for my husband, son and me. There\\u2019s a huge bed. The room feels spacious and it\\u2019s flooded with sunlight. I love it. On the far side of the bedroom is something like a clear plastic tent tarp. Through it I see seven beds lined up against the wall. They are covered with colorful pillows and it\\u2019s so bright and inviting. There\\u2019s a paper with instructions for how to set up the pillows so they all fit. I think how wonderful it would be to invite friends over. I want to negotiate with the realtor about renting just this part of the treehouse, not the whole place. She won\\u2019t get as much of a commission as she wanted, but maybe she\\u2019ll be happy to have something rather than nothing. As we are leaving, we are putting on our shoes on the deck just outside the front door. My dad is trying to be funny. We have the same kind of shoes - brown plastic slippers. He\\u2019s trying to put on one of my shoes but it of course doesn\\u2019t fit. I tell him to give me back my shoe. Then I\\u2019m in a hospital in Hawaii. I\\u2019m partially in a room with a curtain and partially outside. My best friend from middle school is giving birth. They are torturing her, pushing on her stomach, squeezing and twisting. She\\u2019s in so much pain. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do it that way! You\\u2019re hurting her and the baby!\\u201d I think the baby is dead inside her. She\\u2019s exhausted. I\\u2019m also pregnant and giving birth. I won\\u2019t let anyone touch me. I feel my own stomach and the baby\\u2019s head is down and to the left and okay. I\\u2019m watching people rush around because this is an emergency room. A friend from college, is the doctor. I ask him to check me because I think I can trust him not to harm me or my baby. He approaches me tentatively. He is still unsure of himself around me because I rejected him so many years ago. He has a butter knife with what looks like raw ground beef on it. He puts a towel over me and checks. He brings the knife up and there is blood dripping from it onto his nose. There\\u2019s a look in his eyes like, \\u201cThis could have been my baby.\\u201d He is sad about the loss of our friendship and his desire to be in relationship. The labor is continuing and getting stronger. I look out into the city scene. It\\u2019s mostly grey and full of the sounds of a busy city. Through the grey I see bright red and yellow, the colors of Hawaiian royalty. The Hawaiians have joined together with their drums and are playing the rhythm of life, birth and death. I drum along with them on my belly as if my tummy is an ipu. I see one man stand up above the rest with his drum and he\\u2019s so full of vitality and passion. The passion and rhythm are in such contrast to the city, but this is what I tune into - the red and yellow and drums.\"],[\"There are just snippets of this dream that came through. I\\u2019m in the kitchen of my childhood home trying to put dishes away and reorganize the cabinet. My sister\\u2019s there with me. She\\u2019s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she\\u2019s always playing the victim. Then I\\u2019m in a house - it\\u2019s close by my childhood home. There\\u2019s a man living in it who\\u2019s apparently my significant other, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There\\u2019s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he\\u2019s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I\\u2019m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I\\u2019m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I\\u2019m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There\\u2019s an opera house. It\\u2019s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I\\u2019m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I\\u2019m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There\\u2019s all kinds of magical things in them. It\\u2019s dark up in here and I\\u2019m looking through them. Then I decide it\\u2019s time to leave. Now I\\u2019m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I\\u2019m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There\\u2019s so much snow and I\\u2019m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I\\u2019m driving down, there\\u2019s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn\\u2019t I stop to let them go by, don\\u2019t I know that pedestrians have the right of way. I look at them and I look ahead of me where there\\u2019s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It\\u2019s a small street, I\\u2019m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.\"],[\"There are three or four black women, I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re actresses. They\\u2019re going on stage. One is stunningly beautiful and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re the one who needs to be on stage.\\u201d I keep wanting to build her up and make sure she knows how beautiful she is. For some reason she\\u2019s not seeing how beautiful she is. I\\u2019m trying to convince her through showing her.Then I have berries which look like blueberries. I\\u2019ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don\\u2019t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I\\u2019m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don\\u2019t know who. I\\u2019m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I\\u2019m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it\\u2019s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard. I can see this cartoonish looking town through the branches and it\\u2019s dark and there are lights on. The roads are very hilly and windy.\"],[\"There are three women with complex machines\\u2026.They are angry, they will not work with other people\\u2026.I am curious about them\\u2026.\"],[\"There is a gathering of people. My husband is there. I meet up with Mary to help her out with something.\"],[\"There is a land we must pass through. I\\u2019m with a big group of people. I don\\u2019t recognize any of them from waking life. We get to a point where the tigers are. We\\u2019re strategizing and learning how to get through. We\\u2019re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It\\u2019s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don\\u2019t have anyone to pair off with, so I\\u2019m going through the motions by myself. I\\u2019m also wary of holding people\\u2019s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don\\u2019t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I\\u2019ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don\\u2019t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I\\u2019m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I\\u2019m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties. I\\u2019m sad and disappointed, I feel left out because they haven\\u2019t thought to invite me. I would like to be included.\"],[\"There is a pile of boxes and stuff to be moved\\u2026.I will take care of mine\\u2026.But another pile of boxes is for someone else\\u2026.I wonder if I should go over and help, but I think it will be better if I let them do it themselves\\u2026.\"],[\"There is an operation with water dams - underground controlled waters. One of the dams breaks and the water is flooding. Tons of people are getting caught in the rushing water at the dam. Some are being washed away - children and adults of all ages. I can see them caught under the water. I\\u2019m among the people trying to fix it. Some of us are sitting at the dam, dropping things into the water. Others are trying to pull up and move metal fixtures and objects to stop the water from rushing. One woman at a control panel sees what\\u2019s going on. She strips her shirt off and runs into the water and swims up against the current to try and stop the flow. In another scene, I\\u2019m in my backyard. My neighbors are all walking around the grass. The fence has been broken and they\\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the pieces around to make a solid fence and container for the lawn again. In another scene, I\\u2019m walking up a hill to a mountain village with my son. We are following somebody. We hear a train in the distance. People are trying to stop the train. We are looking for our car. In another scene, we\\u2019ve been given a golden retriever puppy. It\\u2019s nighttime, but we don\\u2019t have a cage for the dog, so we go to a grocery outlet. They are closing up. But we need a dog cage. We end up buying other items. There is one item that goes through and I decide I don\\u2019t want it. We ask if we can return it and they say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s too late. We\\u2019re already past closing.\\u201d So we just decide to take it and come back to return it. Outside there are Latino men with blanket rolls setting up to sleep on the sidewalk for the night. Each of them also has what looks like a wolf head. When I look closely, it\\u2019s an entire white wolf pelt. They each killed their own wolf and made a protective cover for themselves to keep out the cold at night.\"],[\"There was a camp in a new city that I\\u2019d loved where everyone has to audition for which role they would play. There were three options: jock, dancer, cheerleader. I was so nervous because I couldn\\u2019t keep anything straight and I was so damn confused. But I went to the day long try out and got slated to be a dancer which was the best thing you could hope for. I felt honored to have found my place among the elite and most relieved to have found a place and to do my part. A boy was helping me the whole time to be where I needed to be and to remember the moves. He made me immediately feel safe and found and loved. He held onto me and led me and guided me. He has some cut marks on his arms. I touched them and knew his life had been hard and I loved him for that and for making me feel found. He was a good dancer and was so kind. The proctors of the auditions congratulated us and asked how we were going to celebrate and I got on the bus with the boy and my old friend Emily to go see Harry Potter. She told us that we\\u2019d have to remember our part for ten years so to find someone to practice with and I knew I\\u2019d found my person and my place and I felt so good.\"],[\"there was a lot of running outside\"],[\"There was a plane of passengers who were infected that i had to help\"],[\"There was a stranger squatting in the guest house on the far end of my property. The guest house was a little dilapidated and needed lots of work. But there were three beautiful white Lily bushes growing outside of it. It\\u2019s a house I\\u2019ve seen before in a dream. I knew the guy was there but I couldn\\u2019t explain how I knew, I just felt it. No one believed me. I went out one day to confirm my suspicions. I saw the reflection in the window of someone behind me and I turned and no one was there. A tall cowboy western looking guy in a blue flannel. I looked in the window and saw him again and when I turned around he was there with his wife and daughter and they walked away together really floaty and turned around to look at me once. They were ghosts. I was nervous but I went into the house and I saw someone sleeping. I got scared and ran all the way home and he was running behind me. I got inside and closed the door and he stood there begging to talk. So I talked to him and he was actually really nice and asked if he could help fix it up in exchange for living there for a year. I thought that seemed fair. He had a job and was saving all his money to marry his girlfriend. I agreed but didn\\u2019t tell anyone that lived with me about the arrangements. I went out to the pool and my kitties were swimming in it. There was a baby pony near the pool. I swam with the kitties. There was a swing set on the hill above the pool. And there was an eerie feeling about it. My niece was playing on it. I called her over to swim with the kitties and to look at the pony. I don\\u2019t think she listened.\"],[\"There was an old vampire TV show called Angel when I was in high-school. I dreamed I was a character in the show. It took place in a city and at night. That's about all I can recall.\"],[\"There was another dream about something where I didn\\u2019t feel good and I left to go get a soft pretzel snack from a concession stand somewhere.\"],[\"There were many different parts to this dream - some of them in one of the houses I remodeled when I was younger and one in a larger home I don\\u2019t recognize. The section of this dream that stood out the most was towards the end when I was in a dorm room. I was so exhausted from everything I\\u2019d been doing and I just wanted to lay down and sleep until the graduation ceremony I was to go to. I laid down on what looked like a chaise lounge in a bedroom in a dorm room. There was another bed across from me. The entrance to the bathroom was in between the two beds. Although I was exhausted, I was aware, not awake, but aware, that a young man had come into the room and was also getting ready for the graduation. I\\u2019m also young - we\\u2019re both college aged. He\\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\\u2019ve ever seen, like from a different realm beautiful. That was the consensus all around, it wasn\\u2019t just my thoughts, the other women who were around thought the same. He\\u2019s being very considerate of the fact that I'm so tired and has not woken me at all, although I am still aware that he\\u2019s there, I\\u2019m still sleeping because I can feel the exhaustion dragging at my bones. There\\u2019s some sort of conversation he\\u2019s having with some other young women in the room about the plants, the flowers, that he has gathered for lies. He has a very magical quality about him - he seems very wise and ancient, like he knows a lot. So he\\u2019s explaining a little bit about why he\\u2019s picked plants for the leis for this graduation. He actually comes in and sits near me on my little bed, chaise-lounge, and is explaining one of the plants to some of the other women in the room, but I wake up at this point and as he\\u2019s explaining it, I\\u2019m looking at the plant. In the meantime, this beautiful young man creature is trying to get me to hurry because it\\u2019s time to get to this graduation. We haven\\u2019t been, but I\\u2019m just so mesmerized by all the different leis and necklaces in this box - there\\u2019s kukui nut leis and necklaces made of seed beds with over a hundred strands and they\\u2019re twisted together in pink and white and they\\u2019re heavy and gorgeous. But I know how much work has gone into making all these necklaces. There\\u2019s necklaces that have other polished crystal stones that look like pieces of peridot and darker stones, so maybe obsidian and onyx and those are single strands, but the stones are rather large. I start hanging them up in front of me. Suddenly these hooks appear and the hooks begin to fill with all of these necklaces and I\\u2019m running out of room for the hooks for the necklaces to hang. Also in the box is this huge ball of twine, but it reminds me of silk that you use to make necklaces with and it\\u2019s dyed a dark purple and there\\u2019s also beads that are not actually seeds from a plant about the size of those cilantro seeds. They\\u2019re dark brown and dried out with holes drilled through them. There\\u2019s a little package of them and it looks like 50 or so of them. I realize that I want to strand my own necklace with some of these seeds and make my own for part of the graduation although I have no time and I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019d want to do that. I start to bead some of these seeds on the silk twine. I can hear myself say I can put them all on and the young man who is standing there gets a little upset with me and he says, \\u201cNo, those are too powerful. You only need 6.\\u201d I look at him and he\\u2019s upset. He\\u2019s very adamant that I only need 6 on this necklace I\\u2019m making. So I stop. I have probably 10 or 12 on by now, but I stop making the necklace and I put it down. I realize I\\u2019m not going to have time to finish that necklace and I just need to pick one from all the ones I have and get to this graduation. Then the dream shifts and I don\\u2019t remember the rest.\"],[\"There were two parts to the dream - the first part I was with somebody but I don\\u2019t remember who, and it was dark and we were basically squatting at some building and we knew we weren\\u2019t supposed to be there (but we stayed there anyways) and there was some kind of election. We knew we had to leave because there was a new owner that came and we couldn\\u2019t stay. So we left and we went running through the woods and I lost the other person. I had to jump all these fences like one after another after another but they were set up really close to one another, so I would jump one and literally the next fence would be one foot after it. Then there are these artificial lights and I came across the stadium and the security guards were outside and I started jogging like it was my plan to jog there the whole time and look for this high school. I went inside and met this class that was gathered inside talking about their plans for graduation. Somebody said that they were accepted to medical school, somebody else was talking about something that they learned about themselves...like an introduction and it was artificial lighting like in the science lab and for some reason it was a high school. I told everybody, \\u201cI\\u2019ll see you at the University of Connecticut,\\u201d and I was telling them that I went there for high school. We played against them and always lost and I was coming there to find a job. I don\\u2019t think I was me in this dream.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a huge boat, like an oil tanker and cruise ship. I\\u2019m supposed to be on it. A lot of others are getting on, too. I\\u2019m sneaking onto it to get away from whatever situation I\\u2019m in. I\\u2019m on the boat and know I need to run back to wherever I live and pack a bag. I need to pack a really big duffel bag because I\\u2019m taking as much as I can with me and I\\u2019m not coming back. I\\u2019ve been on the boat. It\\u2019s dark and dirty. Some of my friends are on the boat, too. They\\u2019ve packed really big bags. I start to run home through a neighborhood. It\\u2019s dark. I see my friend drive by me in a red convertible. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cDo you need a ride?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYes and I\\u2019m going to need a ride back to the boat. I don\\u2019t want to miss it. Can you wait for me?\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201ci can only wait a little bit because i\\u2019m grabbing something for someone.\\u201d I run into the house. I go to start packing my duffel bag. The only duffel bag I have is an old black and red one. It\\u2019s a bag I won in a golfing tournament that I worked when I was in high school. I still own this bag in real life. It\\u2019s big but not big enough because I\\u2019m not going to be able to fit all my clothes, winter clothes, makeup, toiletries and all of my witchy stuff like my tarot cards and whatnot. I\\u2019m going through all of my things and trying to be really discerning. I\\u2019m grabbing socks for different seasons and long johns for the cold. I\\u2019m trying to grab a puffy coat for winter but also balancing it out with summer clothes. I\\u2019m trying to be discerning as I pack because there won\\u2019t be enough room. I can feel that I\\u2019m getting frustrated. There\\u2019s a lot more to the dream. I don\\u2019t know if I even make it back onto the boat. I just know that it was important for me to get on the boat and there were a lot of others. Everyone is being sneaky because there\\u2019s something or someone trying to stop us. It feels like we\\u2019re escaping but I don\\u2019t know what.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a huge gathering of people all sitting at these long rectangular tables arranged end to end in a larger rectangle. I\\u2019m making pancakes. At first I make a nice batch of thin pancakes and distribute them as if I am feeding my own family, so I give two to each person and three to my husband. Then I look and realize there are so many more people to feed. I panic that they won\\u2019t be fed. I go back and cook another batch. I take a bite out of one, then soften the edge so it doesn\\u2019t look like it was bitten and I can give it away. I give one pancake to each person. Some people say no thank you. The people at the far end turn down the pancakes because they don\\u2019t trust these hippie kind of pancakes and others are watching their diets and don\\u2019t realize these are good for them. I make another batch and pass by my mother-in-law and my husband. She had been given two from the first batch and my husband was given three. I see that she has given her pancakes to my husband and he\\u2019s eating them, completely unaware that others are hungry. I hate it so much that they are totally unaware of other people\\u2019s needs. She could have given the extra pancakes away to the people who hadn\\u2019t had any food. He could have given his extra pancakes away instead of eating them all so quickly. I see that my brother-in-law is now trying to help in the kitchen. I\\u2019m annoyed by him, too, because he\\u2019s not being really helpful. I take another batch around. This batch is thicker. Some of the kids and their mom are helping to mix more batter. Their mom has poured the pancakes with a pan and used too much batter. I tell her to only use a spoon - she only needs a little bit for each pancake. Now there are really obese people. Some say no and some say yes to the pancakes. They feel the pancakes with goopy thick berry syrup. They\\u2019re so messy. When I go back to the kitchen area, it\\u2019s so messy. It\\u2019s not really a kitchen, just an area in the corner with a stovetop. The pancakes are all different sizes and textures. I don\\u2019t want to be involved in the project any longer. I leave. I\\u2019m walking around with a lot of different people, none of whom I recognize. It\\u2019s a hotel. I walk to the end of a hallway. I see Sophie and she bounces up to me, so happy to see me. She tells me all about her rituals and moon circles. I\\u2019m partially interested in what she\\u2019s sharing. Then I realize I\\u2019m responsible for the pancakes and need to get back. She walks with me through the hallways. We see a few people doing a yoga class together. We continue on. There\\u2019s a restorative yoga class happening and it\\u2019s extremely popular. I want to understand why so many people are attending because the teacher isn\\u2019t that great or special. I join near the front even though the class is in progress. I\\u2019m doing the postures and thinking it\\u2019s nice, but there\\u2019s nothing special about it. Suddenly this yappy dog comes running up and almost bites the teacher. A woman runs after the dog. She gets the dog and now somehow they\\u2019re all underwater. Another woman comes out from the crowd to help as if she knows them. She follows them out all the way up the stairs. I use this opportunity to leave and check on the pancakes. It\\u2019s nearly dark and I\\u2019m hoping everybody will have been fed their breakfast. But the pancakes are still cooking. There are pancakes of all sizes, some are stacked in baskets, some are stacked on plates and some are still cooking on the griddles. The heat is on but no one is watching. I\\u2019m worried that the pancakes will be burnt or too crispy. I take some of them off the griddle and keep some of them on to cook more. I step out and am told that the kids\\u2019 mother will be back with her husband later. They\\u2019re bringing their guns and will camp out and protect the pancakes overnight as they cook through the night. I guess it\\u2019s an okay idea, but I\\u2019m still uncomfortable with the pancakes cooking unattended. I switch off the heat on all the stovetops. I scoop the remaining pancakes out.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a lead up to this scene, but it\\u2019s escaping me. It was connected because it set me up for the emotions. What I do remember is being in a room. I\\u2019m in charge of making a meal for these children that are coming in. It\\u2019s a soccer clinic and all of these younger children are a part of it. It\\u2019s a mix of boys and girls and I think they\\u2019re all between the ages of 8 and 12. I\\u2019m supposed to be preparing the food, but also making sure there\\u2019s enough for everyone. There\\u2019s probably 50 kids coming through to eat. I\\u2019m working on it. The deadline is getting closer for the time I need to have the food prepared. It\\u2019s not totally prepared. There\\u2019s an interesting piece happening here where I have a basket of feathers - they could be chicken and raven feathers. I am taking the feathers and sewing them one at a time onto this food and it makes the food more abundant. So, I\\u2019m full on doing spells here - totally witchy. I\\u2019m realizing I\\u2019m running out of time, though. This man I know comes in. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019ll help you get this fixed up.\\u201d He comes in. His energy is very jarring to me. He grabs a bunch of feathers, and instead of helping make the food more abundant, he starts on this art project with the feathers. He\\u2019s talking the whole time - fucking windbag taking us so much air and space. He\\u2019s saying, \\u201cWe need to listen to this music,\\u2019 and he puts this music on. It\\u2019s kind of jazzy and reminds me of the band Pink Martini from Portland. He is ruining the flow and I don\\u2019t like it. Now I\\u2019m really not getting things done. The thing is he\\u2019s so earnest and he thinks he\\u2019s helping. But of course, my self-reflection is, oh why do you have to be a bitch about it? But he\\u2019s not fucking helping. And he\\u2019s just taking up so much space and hijacking it. The kids start to come in now. The food is not ready. He says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay kids! We\\u2019ve got plenty here!\\u201d I\\u2019m looking at him and am like, \\u201cWe barely have enough to feed the ten that just showed up and there\\u2019s going to be forty more coming.\\u201d So the first ten come in, get their food and they\\u2019re eating what they have. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, this is fucked. I don\\u2019t have the rest of everything I need.\\u201d The magic spell was like fishes and loaves - I was making more food out of the food we had - and now I don\\u2019t have any more of the food base material to make more food with. So more children come in. They\\u2019re sitting at tables with their plates. They had to go to their spot, grab their plate, walk to the buffet line, then fill up their plate. Now all these kids have their plates, but their plates are empty and they\\u2019re looking at me. All that\\u2019s left are mashed sweet potatoes or yams. They\\u2019re looking at me and the bacon is all gone - the meat/protein is gone. There\\u2019s not other vegetables. It\\u2019s just this bit of sweet potatoes and there\\u2019s not enough for the kids that come in. They\\u2019re staring at me and I have the worst sinking feeling in my stomach because I can\\u2019t feed the kids. It\\u2019s because my super efficient and effective ways of making food stretch and last just got hijacked by this dude. I wake up feeling completely fucking irritated.\"],[\"There\\u2019s a man and I think he is a father figure, sort of older. He\\u2019s swimming in the water down by the bottom. His t-shirt gets caught in the coral (which happened to me when I was a teenager, but I got away). I intuit before it happens that he\\u2019s going to get stuck. I\\u2019m standing there watching then dive down quickly to release him. I bring him back up. It\\u2019s pretty deep and it looks like we\\u2019re going up thirty feet. But when I was watching him, it felt like I was only about eight feet above. I watch his face the whole time as we\\u2019re going up. His eyes are open and there are bubbles of air going out of his mouth.\"],[\"There\\u2019s an awkward dream with a former friend, Liz. It\\u2019s like Edward and I have given her an itemized receipt or invoice for her to review and pay. She\\u2019s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There\\u2019s another dream where we\\u2019re looking at a house. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull. In another dream scene, I go into a bakery through the side door where baking scientists are discussing plans for the day. I\\u2019m not sure whether to leave or stay and ask my question. I don\\u2019t feel particularly welcome in this food laboratory.\"],[\"There\\u2019s Hawaiian boys, Chance and Shane, they are charming, good looking guys, younger. Annette and I were hiring them to help us move and we were paying them. I thought they were really sweet. After they moved everything, we realized they stole from us. I can\\u2019t remember what they stole, but they did. So we found them and got it back and accused them. They were so sorry. We felt bad for them. So we let them work for us again. This time they stole even more - thousands and thousands worth of stuff.\"],[\"There\\u2019s one part where I\\u2019m nursing a baby. I think it\\u2019s mine. My breasts are engorged as if I haven\\u2019t nursed in a while and the milk is coming out so fast, it\\u2019s almost choking the baby. Then I\\u2019m with my parents. I\\u2019m outside on a street. There\\u2019s a curb and a bunch of stand up paddle boards stacked. There\\u2019s a bunch of water coming down the street. It\\u2019s flooding again. These stand up paddle boards are stacked outside of a store and they\\u2019re starting to float off. These boards are a product that once you use them for their initial use, they turn into something else, then turn into something else again. I think it\\u2019s quite clever that the people who own this store have managed to figure out how to make items with multiple purposes. So the stand up board changes into a tank for a toilet, which is super efficient and only needs very little water and one flush, then also turns into an indoor house plant or a decoration. I am getting the sense that the products this store is putting out are amazing because each product is 3 different products within one. I\\u2019m standing in this street that\\u2019s flooded, trying to restack the boards, because I think it\\u2019s important for people to get on board with a shop and people who can figure out how to be so efficient and not waste materials and provide the basics of what we need because a stand up paddle board seems like a good idea when the streets are flooding. Then, the dream shifts. There\\u2019s a lawn. I\\u2019m standing on the side. There are a bunch of people mingling on the lawn - mostly white people. But there\\u2019s a Japanese family - mother, father, son. They\\u2019re a little bit away from the rest of the crowd and it looks and feels like it's a bit awkward and they aren\\u2019t being welcomed into the crowd. But they\\u2019re making do because they\\u2019re talking with each other Isee the father pick up a pinecone to toss at the son, for him to hit with a bat or catch, like baseball. The dad is in a suit. Everyone on this lawn is very well dressed. All of a sudden, the scene changes. I\\u2019m at a Japanese baseball game - in Japan, Japanese players, Japanese crowd. They\\u2019re so athletic. I\\u2019m watching the pitcher pitch and the batter sprint. I\\u2019m taking in their very athletic movements and noticing how in American culture we\\u2019re very snobbish and don\\u2019t think that others are as athletic as we are. But clearly these Japanese players have major skill and are even better than our American players. I\\u2019m also noticing how attractive each one of them are. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWow! I should be dating a Japanese baseball player!\\u201d Then the scene shifts. There\\u2019s a Japanese woman with jet black hair, down to her butt, straight, shiny, gorgeous. She\\u2019s in a skirt suit and I notice she\\u2019s wearing a wedding ring. She has a clipboard and cellphone. She\\u2019s clearly very busy, runs a lot of things, is very important. She\\u2019s walking down a sidewalk under trees. It looks like she\\u2019s walking outside the baseball stadium towards the owner\\u2019s booth. I watch as she sits down in there. The dreams shifts again to something else and I\\u2019m not actually in most of it; I\\u2019m just observing again.\"],[\"These are fragments: Gems underground. Chris Cuomo was having a party next door and it was just like you would imagine someone on tv is like in real life. I think I had been watching a lot of news or something. He was having a party and wearing a suit, maybe a plaid suit like old school. Young black man showing me where he died twice. Singing Hare Krishna. Woke up with maha mantra on my tongue.\"],[\"They were with anime characters. I believe i was in some type of relationship with them and we were following their original storyline. It\\u2019s just that I was an additional character on the side.\"],[\"This dream has a deeper part where I know I was deeper in the dream realms or sleep. There\\u2019s a castle - this huge black maybe glass castle perched on the edge of a shoreline. It\\u2019s super dramatic with tall cliffs and ocean waves hitting the edge of the cliffs. Everything is dark - the ocean and the sky. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s dark because it\\u2019s stormy and cloudy or because it\\u2019s night time. The inhabitants of the castle, myself included, are all pegasuses - horses with wings. They kind of remind me of the cartoon from my childhood, \\u201cMy Little Pony,\\u2019 but it\\u2019s not light and joyful like that cartoon. It\\u2019s definitely darker, not sinister, just dark. There\\u2019s a couple of us flying pegasus horses. We are friends and we all have our own magical powers. We have things to do and are coming and going. It\\u2019s clear that I have a journey to take. I need to go somewhere and fly through the sky. The first part of this journey is me looking for another pegasus sister. She has gone down into the ocean to find something. I realize I need to do the same thing. There\\u2019s a greenish blue orb of light that is way, way deep below the waves and that\\u2019s where I need to go. I\\u2019m flying over the ocean waves looking for this sister and for my way in. Finally I dive into the water. It\\u2019s not cold and I can breathe under the water. It seems pretty normal. I\\u2019m swimming/flying through the water going really deep to find this blueish green light. I do eventually get to it. It takes a long, long time. I know there is something waiting for me and I don\\u2019t remember what it is when I wake up. Whatever the information is, I receive it and I come back up out of the ocean. I\\u2019m not supposed to go back to the castle. I know I am to continue this journey. So now I\\u2019m flying over the ocean. The dark has gone. It\\u2019s like when a storm starts to clear and patches of light come through. I\\u2019m heading to blue sky, sunshine and bright daylight. Clouds are breaking up. I\\u2019m flying out of the darkness and towards the sunny, lighter part. The water beneath me is changing from black, dark, inky and choppy waves and storm tossed waters to deep-dark blue of a darker ocean to greenish blueish turquoise and I think the water is getting shallower. Then I get to a point where there is more land. I\\u2019ve left the land with that castle, which was all dark and craggy with cliffs. The land back there was like black lava rock. As I approach this land and the water gets shallower, I can see shoals and places with coral reef that I can see, then little atolls - places with a little bit of land above the water. Then there is even more land above the water with palm trees. It\\u2019s more substantial and I can see that off in the distance there are homes - a neighborhood, actually. What strikes me is as I\\u2019m flying over this place, I see a wooden bridge. I land on the bridge and as soon as I land, I turn from pegasus to human. Then I notice the water around me is light green and really shallow. You can see algae growing on rocks and the water is really warm. It\\u2019s the brackish water of a hot spring. I can tell because of the smell that the water is from a hot spring coming up into the ocean. So there is a completely different kind of plant and animal life happening here. I get in the water. All of it is so heartbreakingly beautiful - the colors, the shape of the land and reef underneath, the rocks in the water that I\\u2019m walking in, the color of the water, the color of the plants, the flowers, the birds. There are hummingbirds flying in and out, getting the nectar from the flowers. There is so much life. Part of me is still that pegasus, but part of me is human now, because I turn into human as I walk over this bridge. There is a car parked on this wooden bridge. My first thought is, \\u201cHow did that car even get on there? The bridge does not seem wide enough for a car, only a human. And how is this wooden bridge holding up a car?\\u201d Then I see a woman sitting in the car. She\\u2019s taking in the view the way I am. I can tell she has parked her car there because it is healing for her to be in this gorgeous brackish hot spring ocean verdant full of life area. There\\u2019s just enough room for me to walk past the backend of her car and finish crossing this bridge. Her car is in the middle of the bridge. As I walk past the car and onto this second section of the bridge that takes me to land where these houses and this neighborhood are, I feel a shift happen. I leave that very mystical and magical place I had been in with the castle and the journey over the ocean and being a flying horse, and now I\\u2019m in human world. But I\\u2019m very aware that I\\u2019m actually a pegasus. It reminds me of the movie, \\u201cThe Last Unicorn,\\u201d where they turn the unicorn into a human girl and she has to wander the forest until she finds the rest of her unicorn sisters who were turned into white water ocean foam. I feel that way. I\\u2019m not human but I\\u2019m in human land. There\\u2019s another bridge. The bridges change. The first one was a wooden platform bridge and this next bridge is a swinging wooden bridge that dips down and swings when you walk on it. The reason for these bridges is that they are going over the water. There are little islands of land and I haven\\u2019t made it to solid land yet. Even then, there are ravines through the solid land. The land is not yet solid or flat. I can see past that it is flat at a certain point. I have to go over these bridges to get to that solid point. The problem is I come to a third bridge and I can see at the other end a sign that says No Trespassing. It\\u2019s not facing me - it\\u2019s facing the other way. My side of the bridge is open and in fact, everything has been open. But as I get to the end of the other bridge, it\\u2019s sort of like a dead end. There\\u2019s a house. Interestingly enough, there is a bridge parallel to this one that has chains on it that go across. The chains are very clearly there to keep people from crossing or passing. There are signs on that bridge saying you\\u2019re trespassing if you're on here. The bridge I\\u2019m on only has the trespassing sign at the end of it. I go to cross it and it stops at this house. Their backyard is really low, below me. Their house is up a bit on a hill. I can see into their garage area. There are people - two women and a couple of children - and they see me coming. They\\u2019re not poor, but it\\u2019s like the simple houses in Hawaii. They look at me like I\\u2019m not supposed to be there. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI know, but I\\u2019ve come from the other direction. There were no signs where I came from indicating that I couldn\\u2019t come this way.\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cCome down off that bridge and come into our yard.\\u201d Somehow I figure out how to come off the bridge. The thing is I need to continue on because I know there is a house I need to get to that is much further down this path. At the end of this bridge is a road I was supposed to walk on and follow down. This road is on a place called Puako on the Big Island. This neighborhood looks exactly like Puako. In waking life, I lived there for a year with an ex-boyfriend and it was a beautiful place to live. There are palm trees, kiawe trees and sand. The ocean is to my left and land is to my right. I\\u2019m trying to get on this road and my ex-boyfriend is down at the end of the road at a house. There\\u2019s a house with a lot of people and a party going on. I\\u2019m trying to get there, but a part of me doesn\\u2019t actually want to go there. I\\u2019m wondering: \\u201cWhy do you want to go there? There\\u2019s nothing in that for you.\\u201d Because there is this stopping point - this gate - for me at the end of this bridge, I can\\u2019t go any further. The women in this house want me to get off the bridge and come down and be with them. I do. Everything changes in that moment to very mundane world. They tell me there\\u2019s a concert happening. I\\u2019m curious about the concert. It\\u2019s a typical party with smoking and drinking, like the college kind of party. But it\\u2019s the neighborhood with all ages. Somebody is going to come play music. There are three younger men who come near me. They try to engage with me and talk with me. I notice at this point that it\\u2019s cold. I have knit handwarmers and a knit hat on. The pair of handwarmers is a pair I actually own - they\\u2019re elastic and grey and I knit them for myself. There\\u2019s another pair of handwarmers in my pocket that I have as extra in case anyone needs. One of these young men is talking with me about how he\\u2019s cold. I say, \\u201cWell, why don\\u2019t you just put on a pair of handwarmers? I have an extra pair.\\u201d I look down and see that he has a knit pair on, too. In my mind, I think, \\u201cOh, he has a pair of handwarmers that I\\u2019ve wanted to knit. I just haven\\u2019t gotten to it yet.\\u201d He takes one off. So now he\\u2019s wearing one and he has another in his hand and he says, \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve lost one.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s in your hand!\\u201d This whole time he and his other hand are giving me this weird vibe. I really don\\u2019t want to be around them and I don\\u2019t want to be at this party. I\\u2019m looking for a wide open space where I can transform back into the pegasus and fly away. So I find this place in the yard, but it\\u2019s covered in lentils. It\\u2019s a mountain of lentils. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my god, I can\\u2019t transform in this. I can\\u2019t even walk in this. It\\u2019s just a mess.\\u201d The ground is not solid. I can\\u2019t anchor in so I can transform. In the meantime, these three younger men have followed me. I\\u2019m trying so hard to get away from them. I don\\u2019t want anything to do with them, the party, the vibe of the neighborhood. I\\u2019ve gone too far into this reality. I can tell. I want back into the other one. Even if I could just get back across the bridge, back into that incredibly beautiful land and the bridge that was beautiful in its own way and there weren\\u2019t all these humans yet and it wasn\\u2019t packed in. I just want to get back there or fly back all the way back to the castle. But I can\\u2019t. I am so stuck and I cannot transform. I start to feel panic and anxiety because if that is my grounded space, I don\\u2019t want to be grounded there. I want the other more beautiful space. I wake up with panic, anxiety and grief because I can\\u2019t get back to that beautiful place and I can\\u2019t transform back into my pegasus self and I feel so stuck.\"],[\"This dream is remembered mostly backwards. The last scene of the dream I look down at my phone and it\\u2019s lit up with Jeremy\\u2019s name. He\\u2019s calling. I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it\\u2019s him even though he\\u2019s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I\\u2019m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it\\u2019s not a video call, I can see him. He\\u2019s sitting on an oversized chair. He\\u2019s very awkward. He says, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s Jeremy.\\u201d I say, \\u201cI know. Hi, how are you?\\u201d I\\u2019m trying to be light. Then he says, \\u201cI owe you an explanation.\\u201d So then he starts to share. I can\\u2019t really hear what he\\u2019s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I\\u2019m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It\\u2019s urgent. I\\u2019m running through snow. It\\u2019s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We\\u2019re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It\\u2019s a big pool and I\\u2019m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn\\u2019t notice that the water has been draining until it\\u2019s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I\\u2019m at dinner. It\\u2019s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.\"],[\"This dream really did not want to stick. I kept trying to call it back and it wouldn\\u2019t come even though I could feel the felt sense of it. There was something good going to happen if I could just get the right thing to happen - if I could just be lucid enough in the dream and follow the thread of what felt good, then something good would happen. I was in a large dance hall and the windows were floor to ceiling with curtains on either side. There\\u2019s bleachers. I\\u2019m sitting on the bleachers and take my shoes off. The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they\\u2019re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don\\u2019t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren\\u2019t there. All of a sudden, there\\u2019s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you\\u2019d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - \\u201chey go look over there, there\\u2019s all these shoes.\\u201d There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn\\u2019t progress through the dream if I didn\\u2019t find them. And I didn\\u2019t.\"],[\"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I\\u2019m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There\\u2019s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I\\u2019m packing bags. There\\u2019s a reason, although I don\\u2019t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I\\u2019m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, \\u201cAre you sure you should be doing that?\\u201d I tell her, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, I have to do this anyway.\\u201d Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: \\u201cHow old is that child?\\u201d I look down in puzzlement and see that she\\u2019s only five. I think, \\u201cHow did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.\\u201d I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, \\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It\\u2019s not safe.\\u201d So, I tell him I\\u2019ve changed my mind. Then I\\u2019m uncertain what to do. Now I\\u2019m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we\\u2019re about to go to. I tell her that it\\u2019s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She\\u2019s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I\\u2019m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It\\u2019s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there\\u2019s one washroom to the left - it\\u2019s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There\\u2019s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we\\u2019re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I\\u2019m able to hear the one person I know - he\\u2019s an author - that he\\u2019s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he\\u2019s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we\\u2019re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I\\u2019m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I\\u2019m getting the feeling that there\\u2019s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don\\u2019t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there\\u2019s two of them - they\\u2019re also talking in hushed tones. I\\u2019m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I\\u2019ve come to this house for and it\\u2019s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn\\u2019t just an idea for a book, it\\u2019s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, \\u201cDo you recognize that?\\u201d I said yes. He says, \\u201cAfter this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.\\u201d So I agree. Then someone comes in that\\u2019s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he\\u2019s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he\\u2019s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s planning this way to get out that\\u2019s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that\\u2019s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I\\u2019m not really listening. I\\u2019m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who\\u2019s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that\\u2019s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cWhat are they up to?\\u201d So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It\\u2019s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn\\u2019t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there\\u2019s urine all over the seat and it\\u2019s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s urine all over it. There\\u2019s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she\\u2019s still five and as I\\u2019m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I\\u2019ve been talking to and he\\u2019s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he\\u2019s drying it with another towel. He\\u2019s just had a shower. So he\\u2019s involved in what he\\u2019s doing. There\\u2019s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I\\u2019ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I\\u2019ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that\\u2019s where I wake up.\"],[\"This dream was about Trump (I\\u2019ve never dreamt of Trump before). In the dream, I\\u2019m in a top apartment or maybe a nice hotel or maybe a really nice attic apartment. I\\u2019m at the top of something. I\\u2019m sealing everything up. I\\u2019m closing the doors, I\\u2019m taping the windows, I\\u2019m taping the cracks. I\\u2019m sealing everything up because something really bad is about to happen and it\\u2019s connected to Trump. I\\u2019m assuming it\\u2019s toxic or poisonous or something. So I\\u2019m sealing everything up to stay safe for whatever is about to happen.\"],[\"this dream was all about Rory and a party he was throwing for work at our old house (which looked a lot like my grandparent\\u2019s old lake cottage). He wanted me to get everything ready but didn\\u2019t give me any idea as to the timing or numbers or theme. He was \\u201cbusy\\u201d with work and so charming to everyone but wouldn\\u2019t tell me anything. This is very much like real life. I woke up feeling so pissed off at him with my heart beating fast. My older sister was there too (in real life she lives in another state across the country, but in the dream she was here). I didn\\u2019t learn until the end that some people were going to stay the night after the party and I was supposed to get the rooms ready.\"],[\"This dream was probably based on the movie I saw tonight before I went to bed: something about the vast of night. The dream was about carrying a family\\u2019s history in the car on the highway. My dream looks different than the movie but the idea was similar which was I was carrying the stories in a car and I went to go drop them off somewhere for someone\\u2019s family history.\"],[\"This dream was really illusive, too. I\\u2019m in the dreams, then I shift into waking consciousness and the dreams are disappearing. I remember a section of this. There\\u2019s a bike race going on. I can\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019m a part of it or if my partner is a part of it. I have a partner, but not somebody I recognize. We have a dog together and we\\u2019re outside somewhere that\\u2019s part of the race. There's bikers going by. But there\\u2019s also this very strange element - they\\u2019re calling them land sharks. But they look nothing like sharks. They look like oversized pigs, actually. The snouts are really elongated and look like the front of a shark. They have four legs. Their bodies are pretty wide and tall. So I\\u2019m watching these bikers bike their race and these land sharks keep showing up and are the same size as the bikers. I have our dog and I\\u2019m going to take our dog out and run on the beach. My partner, this man, is pissed. He is so mad. He is like, \\u201cWhy are you taking the dog out? It\\u2019s going to be eaten by the land sharks.\\u201d Then something strange happens where I am simultaneously watching all of this happen and also the person taking the dog out. Suddenly, it\\u2019s not me with the dog, it\\u2019s my high school friend, Connie. She\\u2019s the one with the dog and her partner is scolding and berating her. It\\u2019s a very gross dynamic. She brings the dog back and puts the dog in the back of the car. She lays down and she\\u2019s clearly depressed and upset about it. I\\u2019m definitely the observer in this piece, where I went from being the one in that role to observing and feeling appalled at the way her partner is treating her.\"],[\"This dream was set at the ski resort and Aaron, one of my late husband\\u2019s friends, came by to ask me what to make his wife for her birthday. When he came over I was choosing from three tie dyed outfits to wear, one off the shoulder green tie dye and one of the others was like a fake drawn on tie dye. I offered him to get the tie dye shirt for her and he declined. I suggested he make her a yellow pillow and he thought about it but thought it was \\u201ctoo much work.\\u201d I tried to explain how easy it was and meaningful. Lastly, I helped him brainstorm getting Grateful Dead concert tickets. In real life he and my late husband played music together with a shared studio rental space. I like Grateful Dead and go to Dead and Co. shows now but this was not something they would have done or I would suggest in real life (he favors ska/punk).\"],[\"This dream was surreal. I dreamt that I was with my high school friends at a basketball tournament but got stuck/lost somewhere. A young Ram Dass came to be with me while I was stuck in some kind of trap. It was intimate physically but not sexual. In some way he represented all teachers, all people. He was just loving me, literally it felt like I was being filled with love. I felt warm and peaceful, content. I have never dreamt of him or any other of my teachers before. I woke up immediately feeling warm and loved.\"],[\"This dream wasn\\u2019t in black-and-white; it was like in dark blue and gray and white colors. It felt like it took place somewhere else entirely- no place I have ever been to in real life. The people I went to see in the dream were familiar to me in the dream but not in real life. I went to see a couple and I think in the dream I had known the male previously but it was years and years since I had seen him. When I got to their house we practiced yoga and I remember doing lots of hip openers and it was like I almost couldn\\u2019t get the deepest stretch because in everything I did, I was so flexible (this has not been the case in real life as I\\u2019ve not been able to practice like I used to). But the release that I felt from forward folds of all types was amazing - it was like I just folded into myself. I think I did a bunch of seated spinal twists, too. These are all things I can do in real life but for some reason in the dream I was like Gumby and I couldn\\u2019t find the tension to release half of the time. Then we all went to bed on the same bed, but it was not sexual. We just fell asleep and when we woke up we had to go somewhere so we scurried around getting ready and we were leaving. I needed to go back and do something like take my medicine or something like that. I messed up the covers and then I woke up.\"],[\"This is the deeper part of the dream that I\\u2019m only remembering flashes of. I\\u2019m with my high school classmates, three girls, Janet, Shawna and Julie. There are other classmates with me, but I\\u2019m not sure which ones. They\\u2019re all getting ready for a party and I\\u2019m trying to get ready with them. The house we\\u2019re in is dark. There was a felt sense of unease. My brother shows up, too. We are fighting and arguing. I\\u2019m not sure what we\\u2019re fighting about, but there\\u2019s definitely discord. All I can remember of this part of the dream is that I\\u2019m trying to get ready. They\\u2019re all ready to go and are leaving. I\\u2019m trying to find shoes to put on. I\\u2019m trying to find an entire outfit - I don\\u2019t know what to wear and don\\u2019t have anything that feels good. Part of it is my resistance to going to this party. It\\u2019s making it hard for me to decide on an outfit and shoes. A coworker of mine is here, too - he\\u2019s my date to this party. Of all the other characters, he\\u2019s the only one I feel comfortable with. He\\u2019s encouraging me in a sweet way to get dressed and get in the car with him. I do. There\\u2019s a party of the dream where I\\u2019m in the car with him and we are going somewhere. That feels nice and my body feels calm in that place. But there\\u2019s so much agitation beforehand when I\\u2019m trying to get dressed, and there is bickering between me and my friends and me and my brother. My coworker is trying to smooth everything out, help me get ready and take me to the party. I go from being in the house in the living room area with friends to being in his Jeep or truck. I have feelings of gratitude and safety while I'm in the car with him. Then the scene changes. I am outdoors near the ocean. There\\u2019s a covered pavilion area and a bunch of people dancing hula. It\\u2019s so lovely to watch them dancing. It\\u2019s a bunch of different haul halaus dancing, so they each have their own style and their own songs. It\\u2019s not super formal because there isn\\u2019t a stage. I\\u2019m standing watching them to my right and behind me. They have their leis and everything. The musicians are somewhere and I can hear them playing the music, but I can\\u2019t see them. Then my hula sister Deborah shows up with her dad and her mom and my hula brother, Uncle Kam who is also my alaka\\u2019i (leader) in the hula halau. We all look at each other and wonder why we aren\\u2019t dancing because we know how to dance and we have dances to share. So, we try to put on our music. Deborah\\u2019s dad starts to play - he\\u2019s our musician - but it\\u2019s so quiet that it\\u2019s hard to hear him over the crowd noise of all the other dancers. There\\u2019s this feeling of being misfits and not allowed or accepted. We are all trying to dance, but since we can\\u2019t hear the music, our movements are all a little bit off. The other dancers are looking at us like, \\u201cWhat are you guys doing? You\\u2019re not good.\\u201d But we are just unable to hear the music fully. That part of the dream fades away. The last thing I remember before waking is a voice saying it\\u2019s time for me to be soft and release all the tension in my body. Let go of the way things were and the way you knew how to do them. Be soft.\"],[\"This is the last part of the dream: I\\u2019m with a group of people in a tropical place. There\\u2019s red dirt like Hawaii, or maybe Costa Rica. My husband along with a couple (our friends and both yoga teachers), and a few others. We\\u2019ve been looking at houses. We come to this piece of land. Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We\\u2019re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they\\u2019re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They\\u2019re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we\\u2019re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings. I see people making the paper boats with bits of paper they found in the trash. There\\u2019s also some kind of healing going on.\"],[\"This is very bad\"],[\"This one was more emotional. I woke up with mixed emotions. In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn\\u2019t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that\\u2019s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows\"],[\"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I\\u2019m with a bunch of people, but don\\u2019t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We\\u2019re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don\\u2019t know where we\\u2019re heading, except that we\\u2019re trying to get out of where we are. It\\u2019s dark. If there is any lightning, it\\u2019s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we\\u2019re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don\\u2019t even know what they all do. We\\u2019re on the move. We\\u2019re all kind of dirty and grungy. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There\\u2019s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I\\u2019ve been practicing pole moves that she\\u2019s given me at home, but something happens and I\\u2019m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I\\u2019m watching. She\\u2019s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can\\u2019t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you\\u2019re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I\\u2019m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They\\u2019re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven\\u2019t touched a pole in weeks and don\\u2019t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it\\u2019s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It\\u2019s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I\\u2019m holding onto the handle to push out. I\\u2019m super disappointed because it\\u2019s so hard for me to do these moves because I\\u2019ve taken so much time off. I don\\u2019t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven\\u2019t been able to do what I\\u2019d like to do. I keep thinking I\\u2019m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I\\u2019ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back. That always bugs me.\"],[\"This was a nightmare of unspeakable betrayal by those I loved and whom I thought loved me.\"],[\"This was an anxiety dream about my daughter and the dentist. It was supposed to be my daughter, but it didn\\u2019t even look like her. It was a smaller child, maybe a toddler. The child had Down Syndrome. We were showing up at the dentist and we had to give her these pills. We gave her the first set of pills and we were sitting there waiting for them to take hold. The dentist was busy in the other room. When I went in there, they were having a breakfast meeting. We were sitting there and my daughter was on drugs for this appointment. They wanted us to give her two pills every 10-15 minutes. So they were having us give her more and more, but they weren\\u2019t even doing anything with her. I was getting really annoyed. At a certain point, I looked at this child who doesn\\u2019t even look like my daughter and they were grinding their jaw like someone on ecstasy. The child was doing this. I was getting really frustrated. The child looked like they had too many drugs in their system, but they kept asking us to give them more. Then I went in to talk to the dentist: \\u201cWhy are you not doing the procedure? She\\u2019s ready to go.\\u201d They were having breakfast and I was really annoyed and the appointment was dragging on longer. There was also a guy in there and he was an astrologer. He had slides up about the Venus cycle. They were actually really cool and I said, \\u201cWow that\\u2019s really interesting, I want to get your book.\\u201d Then I realize that Uranus is square my Venus tonight and I was like, \\u201cHuh, I wonder if it\\u2019s all about meeting this guy and that was some random side note.\\u201d Before we got to the dentist, there were other things going on and images. One was a family washing their clothes in a puddle of water on the side of the street in New York City. it was clean water - it was not gross looking. But I was like, \\u201cOh my god, this poor family.\\u201d\"],[\"This was an interesting dream. I could feel my body but also my thought processes and emotions detoxing through the dream. At one point I lucidly realized I was detoxing from my heart. I could feel energy coming off the heart. I am wandering around outside in a town I don\\u2019t recognize. It\\u2019s dark. There\\u2019s a parade or some kind of street celebration happening. I\\u2019m wandering by myself following an intuitive tug to wander. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going or why I\\u2019m out. I just know that the thing I need to do or see will show up. Sure enough, I\\u2019m walking through an outdoor mall area towards one of the streets. I see my old hula teacher. I know this is why I was walking - I need to talk to her. I also see her twin sister. Her twin sister has a bunch of girls who are going to dance. My hula teacher also has her girls that will be dancing. The twin sister\\u2019s girls are wearing green skirts with white tops. My hula teacher\\u2019s girls are wearing red skirts with white tops. My hula teacher sees her niece with her twin sister\\u2019s halau. She starts yelling at her niece: \\u201cI saw you come take your costumes. Why are you dancing with her?\\u201d She\\u2019s not being nice at all. I\\u2019m observing this from the side. She\\u2019s shaming her hardcore, which is waht she used to do to me. I walk up to her and say hello. She doesn\\u2019t want to talk with me - she\\u2019s just giving me side-eye and stink-eye. She does not want to engage. I walk with her for a little bit. Her students walk ahead of us. The twin sister and those students also walk ahead, so it just ends up being me and her. I look at her and tell her that I was so upset and I\\u2019ve been upset and mad at her with the way she talks to others and treats people. I tell her I understand she thinks she\\u2019s doing it from a place of love, but it\\u2019s really hurtful to others in the way she shames them. She\\u2019s rolling her eyes at me while I\\u2019m saying this. I grab her shoulders and give her a hug and say, \\u201cI forgive you. And don\\u2019t do that anymore. Stop doing that to the people you love. Don\\u2019t do that to me or to the other people in your life.\\u201d - kind of ho\\u2019oponopono style. I think this is where I was doing the detoxing because I can feel a weight come off my shoulders because I finally said what I needed to say to her. She doesn\\u2019t soften towards me, but I get to say what I need to say. The dream shifts. I\\u2019m with people I don\\u2019t recognize. I\\u2019m traveling somewhere. This man who I recognize from infomercials on tv. He is a white dude with greyish-white hair that\\u2019s long to his shoulders, skinny guy. He asks me and some others to come with him. He\\u2019s recruiting us. He wants to show us this product and this lifestyle he\\u2019s created. He takes us to his complex - he lives there, but there are also places for others to live. There\\u2019s a cafeteria where they all go and eat meals. He has a couple assistants that help him. One of his assistants is his brother or something. I\\u2019m getting guru and cult vibes. There is a lot of advanced technology. He is trying to sell me on a way to be really healthy. So he\\u2019s walking me and the other recruits through his program or process of how to do it. The whole time I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDude, you\\u2019re missing some major components. What you call exercise isn\\u2019t exercise. The kind of food you serve is not a healthy way to track food and it won\\u2019t work because the food you\\u2019re eating isn\\u2019t healthy. And no pill has ever gotten anyone healthy ever.\\u201d I\\u2019m mostly silent. We\\u2019re all following him around this complex. At one point he asks me to take off my shoes. So I take off my shoes and they end up in this trash chute. Now I\\u2019m like, \\u201cShit, I don\\u2019t have shoes.\\u201d I\\u2019m going around without them and following him. I feel gross. I don\\u2019t want to be here with this dude. It feels weird. It feels controlling. It feels manipulative. At one point, we\\u2019re in the cafeteria and he\\u2019s sending us and the recruits home because he was disappointed in us and we didn\\u2019t do good enough. That\\u2019s because all of us were questioning him and his weird take on things. We\\u2019re in the cafeteria and he says, \\u201cTake some salso home with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m filling a container with salsa and it\\u2019s overflowing. One of his assistants comes to help and she says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s a lid.\\u201d I don\\u2019t want the salsa because it doesn\\u2019t seem healthy and what am I going to do with a huge bucket full of salsa, anyway. I\\u2019m still barefoot and concerned because I can\\u2019t find my shoes. They\\u2019re taking us off the complex and putting us in a vehicle to escort us off. I\\u2019m frustrated because I don\\u2019t have my slippers. Then the scene changes again. It\\u2019s somewhere in Asia - I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s Japan or China or somewhere else. There\\u2019s a wedding happening. They\\u2019re trying to teach me how to do the wedding ceremony. It\\u2019s complicated and involves dragons and a sleigh that flies in the air. I watch it the first time and am like, \\u201cOkay, I think you\\u2019re missing some parts to this thing because the sleigh isn\\u2019t flying right.\\u201d Then it\\u2019s my turn. A show is going on and they\\u2019ve saved this part for me to do. I manage to get the first part of the ceremony down, marrying this cute couple who are Asian - everyone is Asian and I\\u2019m the only one who is not. There are two dragons hooked to the front of the sleigh. I manage to get the sleigh up off the ground. It\\u2019s going through the air and the couple is in it. I\\u2019m in the back behind decorating it and watching the dragons. The dragons have their mouths on a bar under the sleigh and their momentum is propelling the sleigh forward. All of a sudden I hear someone say, \\u201cYou forgot a piece of it.\\u201d In the ceremony the sleigh is supposed to be able to move forward but then dip and go different directions, but as I\\u2019m doing it, the sleigh comes to a dead stop midair and even though the dragons\\u2019 mouths are hanging onto the bar, their bodies flop down and the sleigh has no momentum. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh god, the sleigh is going to start falling. The couple in it are going to die. I\\u2019m going to die, too, because I\\u2019m somehow connected to all of it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what the missing piece is to keep the sleigh going, to keep the ceremony going, to keep the whole thing moving. I\\u2019m freaking out because either I didn\\u2019t learn it or I wasn\\u2019t taught it or shown it. I know I\\u2019m missing a piece and these dragons are hanging. Then the sleigh starts to drop. The dream shifts. It\\u2019s dark now. I\\u2019m walking through a neighborhood - through the backyards of brick row houses. I\\u2019m on the phone with someone who is my counselor. The person I\\u2019m talking to is a woman. As she and I are talking, we are interrupted by a man. He\\u2019s talking over the woman. He starts to say, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m the one who\\u2019s going to take care of you. Don\\u2019t call her. I\\u2019m the one who\\u2019s talking to you. I\\u2019m taking care of you.\\u201d It\\u2019s very creepy because he\\u2019s very possessive and he\\u2019s speaking in terms of ownership. I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cEw, ick, you\\u2019re supposed to be a therapist.\\u201d The woman hangs up while this other man is still on the call. I keep walking through these backyards. All of a sudden I walk through a backyard and there\\u2019s a table set up. There\\u2019s a big old banyan tree behind the table. I walk up to it. The dude on the phone with me is sitting there. We both hang up and I\\u2019m looking at him and am a little bit freaked out. He\\u2019s in my space now and here face to face and trying to counsel me around something. He\\u2019s creeping me out. He has dark hair that\\u2019s curly and it\\u2019s longish, it looks like a little fro. He tells me to sit down in the chair on the other side of the desk from him. He says, \\u201cI\\u2019m taking care of you now. I\\u2019m your therapist. I\\u2019m the one you\\u2019re supposed to talk to.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to talk to you. You\\u2019re creeping me out.\\u201d Then he starts to say things like, \\u201cAnd yes, I\\u2019m totally flirting with you because I think you\\u2019re sexy and I\\u2019m going to make you mine.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m really fucking freaked out. That\\u2019s where the dream ends.\"],[\"This was kind of a weird dream. I\\u2019m looking for a house to buy. I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m with my ex and the kids or some other family. I just know I\\u2019m with other people and we\\u2019re all looking at houses together. There\\u2019s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you\\u2019d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They\\u2019re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu\\u2019u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I\\u2019m looking and we decide not to buy it because it\\u2019s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I\\u2019m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They\\u2019ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren\\u2019t white anymore. They\\u2019ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I\\u2019m with, I\\u2019m not comfortable with them. I\\u2019m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I\\u2019m not sure who it is; it\\u2019s a female person and we\\u2019re not really friends. It\\u2019s kind of like I\\u2019m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it\\u2019s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We\\u2019re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I\\u2019m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn\\u2019t feel a connection either, so she\\u2019s just gone. As I leave, I\\u2019m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I\\u2019m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn\\u2019t really resonance there anyway. I don\\u2019t know where I\\u2019m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it\\u2019s just not for me.\"],[\"This was so fragmented - I had a dream that I was watching myself on a phone call on a corner having a serious conversation about something and then watching a neighbor come across me who was across the street from me.

The deeper dream I think is a man and me - I think it\\u2019s my ex-husband. We\\u2019re in a house. This person is Santa Claus. He\\u2019s responsible for bringing joy to children, but it looks like my ex and not Santa Claus. We\\u2019re in a house and all around the house is white tundra, so North Pole\\u2019ish. It starts out as a gigantic mansion. I\\u2019m me, but I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m female. It\\u2019s like we\\u2019re two friends. This guy has a role - an important job. It almost feels like I\\u2019m freeloading because there isn\\u2019t anything I\\u2019m doing. He points it out, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t even have a job. You don\\u2019t even have a purpose, really.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOoh, that feels gross. I need to go find my purpose.\\u201d Then it shifts from this gigantic mansion place that is super opulent with gold, wall sconces, chandeliers, and gigantic floor to ceiling windows that are at least two stories tall. I think I\\u2019m standing on this huge staircase at some point. Then the mansion shrinks down to this smaller house. Now it is my ex and me. I don\\u2019t know that I\\u2019m female yet. I think I\\u2019m still his friend - I\\u2019m a dude. There are a bunch of kids that he\\u2019s supposed to be caretaking or bringing the light to. I think they\\u2019re maybe ours. The vibe between the two of us is weird. He\\u2019s definitely holding the power over me. But I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to be caretaking these kids and I\\u2019m actually doing all the work here. You\\u2019re not fulfilling your role.\\u201d So he says to me, \\u201cWell let\\u2019s talk and work this out.\\u201d So while we\\u2019re trying to talk, we\\u2019re also doing - we\\u2019re moving through different rooms in the house, cleaning or packing to go on a trip. We\\u2019re packing things in one room of the house. Then we\\u2019re moving to the kitchen and I\\u2019m packing up food and he is doing stuff. The kids are following us around the house observing what\\u2019s going on. Also we give them small chores to do as we move through rooms in the house. At some point I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhen are you going to stop and hug the children? When are you going to love on them? They\\u2019re wanting our attention, but you just keep giving them these chores to do and sending them off. But what they really want is a hug and some love.\\u201d I ask him that and he gives some sort of weird answer. The implication is that he\\u2019s not going to touch or comfort them. I\\u2019m left to do it. Then it\\u2019s time for the kids to get in the sleigh or the car. They start walking out the door and there\\u2019s quite a few kids - not just 2, but 10. He and I are alone for a second and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cCan we get real now and talk about what\\u2019s going on and this weirdness?\\u201d He says to me something that is pretty profound, but I can\\u2019t remember it. After he says this, I don\\u2019t feel like there\\u2019s been any resolution. I don't feel myself softening towards him. Then the dream totally shifts. I\\u2019m an observer. I\\u2019ve popped into this observer role. There\\u2019s an airport and a huge airplane being loaded - lots of people getting on. There are two guys left. I see a ramp or part of the landing gear. This guy is in shorts, tennis shoes and a long sleeve shirt tied around his waist. He\\u2019s up on the ramp and the plane takes off. You hear the pilot or flight attendants say, \\u201cOkay everyone, you need to get in the plane now. Get all the way in.\\u201d This guy is like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to ride the plane from here!\\u201d It\\u2019s him and another guy on it. The second guy is dressed in one of those flying squirrel suits and has goggles over his eyes. He\\u2019s got a plan - he\\u2019s going to do something as this plane takes off. And he does. As the plane gets to altitude, he jumps off, flies off and goes to wherever he\\u2019s going. The other guy who is in shorts and tennis shoes and a long-sleeved shirt tied around his waist, his goal is to ride out the entire plane ride on this ramp. Part of me wonders if they\\u2019re going to pull this ramp in because you can\\u2019t fly a plane with this ramp hanging off. But this guy\\u2019s goal is to ride on this ramp to wherever this plane is going. His goal is to break some record. I\\u2019m observing all of this, neither in the plane nor on the ramp. But I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s going to freeze to death because it\\u2019s going to be so cold at altitude, and he\\u2019s going to burn his skin to death because he doesn\\u2019t have sunscreen or a shirt on or anything on his face and he\\u2019s close to the sun. Hello?! And there\\u2019s no oxygen. How is he going to do this? This man is so unbothered by all of it. He\\u2019s not scared that he\\u2019s going to let go of the ramp and fly off. He\\u2019s not scared that he\\u2019s going to fall. He\\u2019s not worried that he\\u2019s too close to the sun. He's not worried that he\\u2019s too high up. He\\u2019s not worried that there\\u2019s not enough oxygen. He\\u2019s incredibly unbothered and so relaxed that he actually takes a nap at some point on this ramp as the plane is flying. In my head I know none of this is possible and he would have blown off the ramp a long time ago. But then the plane lands. He lands with the plane. Where the plane lands, there are a bunch of other planes and guys. There are men everywhere and not a single female to be found. It was clearly some kind of competition happening. They\\u2019re all patting each other on the back and congratulating each other. They\\u2019re in different pods. An M.C. comes out and you can hear over the loudspeakers someone say, \\u201cAnd the winner for being most exposed to the elements\\u2026\\u201d They announce the name of the winner, but it\\u2019s not my guy, even though he should have won. You see him be super crestfallen. But everyone else is cheering the winner. The other guy that was in the squirrel suit is there, too. He was also part of a competition - it was about getting to a certain place in the most difficult way. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cDude, my guy on the ramp totally wins because he did not have any fancy gear. He was just in his keds and shorts on a ramp.\\u201d Somebody from the airplane finally speaks up and says, \\u201cActually, I think it was this guy who really won. He wasn\\u2019t really registered and no one took note of him, but he rode this plane the entire time and never fell off.\\u201d All of a sudden, the judges come together and confer. The M.C. gets on the microphone and says, \\u201cThere\\u2019s been a change. The winner is this guy!\\u201d It\\u2019s my guy who was on the ramp the whole time. You see his face light up and he\\u2019s exuberant in a quiet humble way. He\\u2019s not loud like the other guys. I get the sense that he was on a spiritual journey. Yes, he won the competition, but what he was really looking for was for God to acknowledge him, \\u201cYes, my son, you did this.\\u201d It ends with everyone cheering him and him with a really big smile on his face and really humble. I\\u2019m wondering how any of that was possible.\"],[\"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He\\u2019s very protective. I\\u2019m lying down on my back. I can\\u2019t tell where I am. There\\u2019s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I\\u2019m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I\\u2019m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I\\u2019m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I\\u2019m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it\\u2019s the time of coronavirus, people can\\u2019t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They\\u2019re gathered around me and I\\u2019m definitely still vulnerable because I\\u2019m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I\\u2019m telling them: \\u201cMy playlists are for pole classes. It\\u2019s not your normal CrossFit playlist.\\u201d They don\\u2019t care. They\\u2019re adamant that they get a workout. So, it\\u2019s either the man I\\u2019m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It\\u2019s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren\\u2019t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, \\u201cOkay, the winners get some of these ferrets.\\u201d During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s my kids or somebody else\\u2019s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I\\u2019m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they\\u2019re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn\\u2019t going to be what they thought. I\\u2019m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There\\u2019s this process I\\u2019m going through where I\\u2019m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they\\u2019re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can\\u2019t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they\\u2019re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I\\u2019m in the observer role. There\\u2019s a man and his son - I don\\u2019t know who they are. He\\u2019s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he\\u2019s very attentive. They\\u2019re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I\\u2019m not very neutral. I\\u2019m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it\\u2019s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he\\u2019s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, \\u201cWe need to take your son.\\u201d The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I\\u2019m fucking pissed. There\\u2019s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it\\u2019s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he\\u2019s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they\\u2019re basically not listening - they\\u2019re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man\\u2019s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that\\u2019s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.\"],[\"Two people are going into a room, to change something?....a man and a woman\\u2026.They do not want to do it, but I know it is important\\u2026.They are being watched, told to do this\\u2026.Earlier, I see water flowing in a creek\\u2026.a higher wave or flow to the left, like things are tipping that direction\\u2026.\"],[\"Two scenes where there was a neighborhood restaurant or group of restaurants and we needed goggles and masks to go in and some cost extra money.

My sister does this. We are being served cocktails and hor d'oeuvres.

There was an old school book on tape and it was the primer. We were all supposed to read it and there were different versions. There was one in a gift shop but Elon Musk bought all the good copies and I got one that was a basic generic version. A woman with long brown hair and I bonded because she got the same basic version - later we both remarked that we should have gotten the one with the global world view or universalist view, not just American! \\u201cHow small minded of us,\\u201d we laughed! There was this idea that there was a broader view larger than global, larger than maybe even universal, and we were acknowledging the barrier to learning. We made a plan to meet up later, and we were walking on the world like walking on the globe. We were space walking, but it was like on trees and we were going from planet to planet like it was nothing. We were wearing headphones and she pointed to them and \\u201cStanding on the Moon\\u201d was playing but scratchy like old old records sound from the 1920s. Usually that song makes me emotional but I remember feeling nostalgic. There was supposed to be a list a day of who to invite. There was a dad of Asian descent and two of his kids - a boy and a girl - and it was strange to see a boy. I made a comment when he was letting them explore just to let him know it was good to let them go and he thanked me for the reminder. As I am waking up for some reason the numbers 1618 kept coming up in my mind related to this image.\"],[\"Was leading my (real) black roommates through dark alleys to try to keep them from being seen by police patrolling everywhere who might shoot them.

I go into a room that has windows all around.

Hell no! I shout, as several women secretaries look at me\\u2026.I wonder, isn\\u2019t ok for people to yell every now and then, if they need to?....Later, I am talking with a woman who is across in another building, like an apartment\\u2026.We are talking through windows, and she is in the shower, naked?....A couple of other people with her are being casually sexual\\u2026.Hmm, I wonder what I can see\\u2026.At another point, I am in a car with my wife driving, under the streets in Chicago\\u2026.She goes very fast past a police car, I tell her I do not think that is a good idea\\u2026.She tells me not to worry\\u2026.At the end, I feel a cat nibble my ankle\\u2026.I look down and happily see smooth, beautiful brown, gray, black fur, it\\u2019s Levi\\u2026.\"],[\"We had a chance to go somewhere for a social event, but the whole time I was worried that we should be social distancing.\"],[\"We have a little set up of food and drink for a party in my hotel room\\u2026.It is rather cheap stuff, not really good enough for an event like this, a graduation perhaps?....I see a tag is sticking off a bag of chips, making it look even cheaper\\u2026.Someone takes a little dog for a walk, and I worry if the leash is on well enough, so the dog will not be able to get away\\u2026.There is no need for extra drama around something like that\\u2026.\"],[\"We were at a big holiday party for work but at somebody\\u2019s house. There were maybe ten of us and it was all decorated for the holidays. We were celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah in the new year. Someone came that wasn\\u2019t supposed to come and started murdering all the Jewish people. It was really upsetting having people with guns. Then fast forward, I was at the same location and we were doing a world service. I sat in the front room with one of the attendings, Dr. Donovan. It was just three people in the front row -nher and me and somebody else on the left-hand side.
